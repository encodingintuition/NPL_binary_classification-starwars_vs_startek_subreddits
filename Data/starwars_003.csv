55,Star Wars: A Finnale,1599299677,"I also do not like that Finn was sidelined so much after The Force Awakens! So I thought I'd try writing a version of the sequel trilogy finale that he features much more heavily in. 

\*

Finn goes with Rey to Exegol. (From here on, Finn‚Äôs original role in the  movie is taken by Rose.) He has a lightsaber with him, Luke‚Äôs  lightsaber, which counts as his now. Rey has Leia‚Äôs. He‚Äôs completely  untrained but willing to fight to defend the galaxy anyway. Even if he‚Äôs  not necessarily Force-sensitive, he‚Äôs still willing.  

There, Palpatine immediately captures Finn, realising right away that he  must mean something to his granddaughter. He torments Rey by telling her this wouldn‚Äôt be the first time he‚Äôd turned someone into a Sith by  using their love for another. 

Palpatine shocks Finn once with Force lightening and this is enough  to make Rey crumble. She tells Palpatine that he can do whatever he wants, just spare Finn. There you go, almost the exact same way Anakin  fell‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶except Finn isn‚Äôt having it. From behind whatever Force-field  Palpatine has him in he tells Rey that he would rather die than see her  become a Sith and the galaxy in darkness. He tells her he‚Äôs spent all  his life trying to find agency and he‚Äôs damn well not about to let it go  now, even in the face of death. Hey turns out Rey and Finn were the Anakin and Padme of their generation, not the Han and Leia, except  they‚Äôre not about to make the same mistakes.

Palpatine just laughs evilly at this, as he usually does, and is about to deliver the killing blow to Finn but THEN Ben Solo enters the  picture! He strikes Palpatine from behind, causing enough damage to free  Finn from his clutches. Now the game has changed! Rey, Finn and Ben go 3-1 against Palpatine (albeit probably with some confusion on Finn‚Äôs part as to why Kylo Ren is there.) They‚Äôre doing pretty well for the  first few minutes! Then Palpatine aims some lightening at Rey. Finn  somehow deflects it away from her but instead it hits him full-on. 

Rey thinks he‚Äôs dead and is horrified and grief-stricken, but she can hear the voice of Anakin Skywalker in her head telling her not to give into her rage. She listens, and Ben can not only feel her emotions but suddenly hear the voice of his grandfather as well. This distracts him so much Palpatine is able to shove him into the pit and remove him from  the fight.

NOW Rey, all alone and thinking her true love (Finn, not Ben) is  dead, finds herself able to do what it took Anakin a lifetime to  understand. With all the ghosts of all the Jedi working through her, she  calls on the Light Side and defeats Palpatine once and for all. Only then does she run to Finn and allow her emotions to take over. He definitely appears to be dead and she sobs while holding him.

Then Ben comes climbing up out of the pit. He looks at the scene  before him and realises what he has to do. Without a single word said,  he kneels down and he Force-heals Finn. Rey watches in bewilderment. Finn sits up with a gasp, instantly falling into Rey‚Äôs arms. Rey exchanges a look of intense gratitude with Ben and then realises he‚Äôs given all of his lifeforce over to Finn. He‚Äôs dying. She takes his hand, but does not kiss him, as he dies and disappears.

At the end of the movie both Rey *and* Finn (and BB8) return  to Tatooine. Finn wonders how he was able to deflect the lightening away from Rey back on Exegol, and Rey ponders that maybe it‚Äôs a person‚Äôs willingness to sacrifice, rather than any training or even any Force sensitivity, that makes them a true Jedi. She names herself ‚ÄúSkywalker‚Äù and Finn says he would like that name as well, which sounds an awful lot like a proposal.

The sun sets as Luke, Leia AND HAN watch the new generation from the afterlife. All is finally well in the galaxy.

77,‚ÄúGhost of Tsushima‚Äù is the best Star Wars game that isn‚Äôt a Star Wars game,1599276233,"First off, just to address the obvious, the original Star Wars trilogy based the Jedi Order on ancient samurai, specifically Kurosawa‚Äôs portrayal of them. Lightsabers were always held with two hands and the hilt was long enough to grip like a samurai‚Äôs *te-no-uchi* sword grip technique. Even Jedi clothes were inspired by samurai clothing.

That being said, so much of the video game *Ghost of Tsushima* feels like a Star Wars game that never happened but definitely should have. Samurai are portrayed as a class of warriors, trained from an early age. When they fight, they are trained to maintain their honor and detach themselves emotionally from battle. They are called on to administer justice in Japanese society, and are expected to deal with evil and treachery immediately and without remorse. Fighting without honor is against their code, and represents a fall from grace. Sound familiar?

I played through this game feeling like a Jedi on the path toward the Dark Side of the Force. Without revealing too many spoilers, the main character is put in situations where he has to go against his code as a matter of necessity. Through war and conflict, he learns that the samurai must change their understanding of honor and justice. The entire storyline is reminiscent of Revan‚Äôs experience in the Mandalorian Wars, as portrayed in the *Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic* game series.

Aside from that, *Ghost of Tsushima*‚Äôs gameplay of wielding a lethal katana makes me wish we could have a game that actually treats the lightsaber like a lethal weapon rather than a pool noodle, but that may just be personal preference. At any rate, I believe that a Star Wars game in the vein of a Kurosawa-inspired samurai epic is a much-needed addition to this beloved franchise.",StarWars,FibroMyAlgae,False,/r/StarWars/comments/imu41e/ghost_of_tsushima_is_the_best_star_wars_game_that/

Is there a canonical, in depth, explanation for why the original trilogy makes the galaxy feel very sparsely populated and far less bustling in comparison to the prequels, where it seems to be much more populated and far more bustling? 

I know that following order 66, the empire began taking over the galaxy and thus restrictions on everything would grow tighter, but what happened to places like coruscant? Is there a canonical explanation for why we never see it? Why the only real populous planet we see is Bespin's cloud city? And even cloud city seems to be closed off and small scale. Every planet we see is dominated by forest or sand, with little to no civilization. 

I understand that it's possible to explain this by saying they simply don't go anywhere like that on camera, but it seems like, especially coruscant, bustling places like this would lend more importance to the story if they were existent at this time. 

Is it simply that because coruscant and the Jedi fell out of power that planets across the galaxy were left with broken infrastructure and left to die by the empire? Or is it as simple as being that we don't see them on camera? Perhaps there are more details that are significant. 

The transition between episode 3 and episode often feels very very distant for this reason, and I understand that is at least partially by intention, but bridging that gap is interesting nonetheless.",StarWars,MaxKCoolio,False,/r/StarWars/comments/ims9qz/why_does_it_feel_like_civilization_had_collapsed/

62,"Theory: Take out the ""treasure hunt"" and structure around the characters- and TROS suddenly becomes a damn compelling movie.",1599250037,"JJ has said numerous times that he wanted to structure TROS after globe-trotting or treasure-hunt adventure movies like Indiana Jones and The Goonies.

It's a great idea for Star Wars in general... but it feels at odds with all of the character arcs and plot threads that are actually at the heart of the movie. This is a movie about concluding a generations-long myth, it's about the redemption of Ben Solo, the culmination of Rey's heroic purpose, and the culmination of their romance. It's about the final battle for the heart and soul of the galaxy, about Poe coming into his own as a leader of the Rebellion, about Finn achieving his highest purpose as the redeemed face of faceless fascism.

Star Wars movies have long used the ""body"" of a genre to lend structure- Attack of the Clones has the DNA of a James Bond/Detective Noir thriller, Revenge of the Sith pulls from greek tragedy, The Last Jedi pulls from high-stakes military movies and heist films. But all of those influences mesh in clear ways with the character dynamics within the film, and reinforce, rather than distract from, the major dramatic anchors of the story. TROS dedicates about half of it's runtime, and all of it's structure, to an Indy-style series of McGuffin chases, and although character/plot development happens, it often feels like the emotional stakes of the film are ancillary to the plot itself. The best Star Wars movies- heck, even some of the worst- structure their major beats around the needs of the character and thematic arcs first, and only pull in outside influences when it magnifies the potency of those arcs and themes. I think, from a writing perspective, that's a core reason why TROS didn't hit as a fully satisfying trilogy/saga ending chapter for a lot of people.

Fun experiment: Imagine if TROS featured all the same major character arcs- but instead of structuring this story around a treasure hunt, maybe it's structured after (and I'm just spitballing)... Braveheart. Or Return of the King. Les Miserable, Spartacus- any number of stories that feature the rallying of common people against impossible odds, and the triumph of moral heroism in the face of cruel power. Stories that successfully balance cataclysmic, world-changing events with intimate human emotion. 

Imagine a TROS where:

-Rey still fulfills her heroic purpose, wrestles with her family legacy, and redeems/romances Ben Solo, but she does so without spending half the movie searching for artifacts that won't matter by the time the movie is over. 

-Poe still leads the rebellion and rallies the galaxy against the Empire- and we have time to see him *actually do it*. 

-Finn still finds allies in fellow defected troopers- but it's not just a sidenote. He maybe even gets to lead that ""stormtrooper rebellion"" everyone was hoping for. 

-Rose actually gets to do something, because her purpose as a character (representing the ""little guys"" forgotten amid the war) actually becomes a crucial dimension of the story of galactic rebellion. 

And above all, with the treasure hunt taken out, all these arcs get to happen on their own terms, with room to breathe and become emotionally invested. There's still plenty of room for classic Star Wars fun, but the story itself would be built for the emotional stakes of the story, not in spite of it.",StarWars,hanburgundy,False,/r/StarWars/comments/imn9ji/theory_take_out_the_treasure_hunt_and_structure/

70,Does Disney deserve all the hate?,1599245208,"So, this might be a controversial topic but it's something that has been bothering me as a huge Star Wars fan.

As the title might explain, I was wondering if Disney Star Wars deserves so much of the hate it's given and what the opinion here is. Now, don't get me wrong, I understand why people dislike the Sequel Trilogy. I myself don't hate it per se, but it does have far more issues and wasted potential than it had any right to have.

But, thing is, the Sequel Trilogy isn't the only thing that Disney has produced. Rogue One, Rebels, the Mandalorian, Jedi: Fallen Order, numerous good novels... Possibly even Squadrons. Yet wherever I look so many people seem to ignore them and pretend like Disney has only produced bad Star Wars.

So my question is, do Disney's missteps genuinly outweigh the good things they've done to Star Wars? I don't mean to start a flame war, I just like to know the general consensus here.",StarWars,Timjer92,False,/r/StarWars/comments/imls7p/does_disney_deserve_all_the_hate/

72,A quote from John Williams explains why John Boyega doesn't blame JJ for sidelining Finn in TRoS,1599244317,"I noticed something interesting in John Boyega's recent interview with GQ magazine where he called out the sidelining of Finn in the Sequel Trilogy.  While John Boyega is clearly upset (and rightly so) with how his character was treated in the trilogy he appears to cast no blame at J.J. Abrams despite the fact that Abrams directed and co-wrote TRoS which is arguably just as guilty of sidelining Finn as TLJ. Yet in that interview when discussing J.J. Abrams John Boyega said the following:

&amp;#x200B;

 ""Everybody needs to leave my boy alone. He (J.J. Abrams) wasn't even supposed to come back and try to save your \[expletive\]"" 

&amp;#x200B;

If John Boyega is upset that his character was sidelined why is he in the same breath defending the man who would appear to bear significant responsibility for that sidelining? 

A quote for John Williams in an interview he gave with KUSC radio gives a potential answer:

&amp;#x200B;

 *‚ÄúThe process went along for about six or seven months for me where we‚Äôd write a scene that \[JJ Abrams\] had given me and then I‚Äôd complete the scene, possibly even record it, and he‚Äôd say ‚Äúwell that scene is not in the film any more. We‚Äôve done something else. We need to replace it.‚Äù*  

&amp;#x200B;

What's he talking about here?

 John Williams stated in the interview with *the Times* that as of May 10, 2019 he had already written 25 minutes worth of music. A film's score needs to precisely line up with what is on screen. Its a waste of the composer's time for them to start writing the score if the director still intends to make significant alterations to the cut. The fact that J.J. Abrams gave a cut of the film to John Williams at some point prior to May 10th suggests that J.J was pleased with that cut of the film and felt that all it needed to become a complete film was the score, finalized visual effects, sound effects, etc.

However, throughout the Summer of 2019 and into the fall it was widely reported that TRoS was undergoing significant reshoots. So while John Williams was hard at work on the score new scenes were being filmed and according to Williams some of those scenes not only altered existing scenes but replaced them all together.  

Now consider what John Bogeya said happened when he first read the script for TRoS:

&amp;#x200B;

""*I was excited when I read the script. I actually read it, and I stopped, and then I went and had a conversation with JJ. I was like, ‚Äúthank you, man. I‚Äôve been- I‚Äôve been waiting for this.‚Äù*

&amp;#x200B;

Given that John Boyega was extremely thankful for what J.J. Abrams wrote, but now is rightfully upset that Finn was sidelined and given that John Williams has said that scenes from the reshoots replaced scenes that were in the early cut there's only one conclusion: The early cut of the film that J.J. Abrams first gave to John Williams contained a much better arc for Finn.  Lucasfilm forced J.J. Abrams to remove it.",StarWars,HypersonicHarpist,False,/r/StarWars/comments/imli7s/a_quote_from_john_williams_explains_why_john/

13,Why I believe the sequels didn‚Äôt ruin anakins sacrifice,1599231871,"1 technically anakin brought balance twice once with order 66 and over throwing palpatine the prophecy says he is to bring balance that means same amount of light as there is dark and in order for that to happen he had to bring the Jedi down because there  were to much leading in an over amount of light so what I really think he did was boost the dark up to the light but the empire grew bigger and bigger leading in the dark sides favor so anakin over thew palpatine and just because he didn‚Äôt kill him doesn‚Äôt mean he didn‚Äôt bring the dark down to the lights level because like yoda and obi wan palpatine went into hiding with no power bring balance because now the light and the dark have the same amount of power in the galaxy.

2. I don‚Äôt know if you have heard of the sith‚Äôari Prophecy, it‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Sith'ari will be free of limits. The Sith'ari will lead the Sith and destroy them. The Sith'ari will raise the Sith from death and make them stronger than before‚Äù It was foretold in a prophecy that there would be a dyad in the Force, which had been unseen for generations by the time of the New Republic Era. The prophesied dyad was realized within Kylo Ren and Rey. During the battle on Exegol, the life force of their dyad was used to restore palpatine. But it also said the sith‚Äôari (Ben and Rey) would bring balance by making the dark side dominate like how the Jedi said the chosen one (anakin) would bring balance by making the light dominant so both the sith and Jedi prophecy were true and wrong at the same time just miss read even yoda and obi wan said that. Balance was brought back by Ben and Rey because Luke tipped it off leaning towards light. So what I‚Äôm basically saying is anakin wasn‚Äôt ruined he still for filed the Jedi prophecy while Ben and Rey for filed the sith prophecy (anakin walked so they could run) bringing complete balance on both sides.

43,Why I Love the Sequel Trilogy,1599219800,"I‚Äôve been having a stressful day and need to vent my feelings a little.

I first discovered Star Wars as a little kid back in 2007 when I went to the house of an old family friend and their kid was playing this cool shooting game with robots and people in white armour. He then showed me Revenge of the Sith on DVD. From there I played LEGO Star Wars  and watched all the movies. But I was never a big fan of the series. Until 2015 when The Force Awakens came out. I had somehow not heard about it until about a month before it came out. It was the first Star Wars movie I saw in theatres along with my father. I fell in love with all the characters and story and couldn‚Äôt wait to see more. When I saw The Last Jedi I was a little mixed on it but after seeing it a second time I saw the great story beats and characterisation in it. It was the same for The Rise of Skywalker.

I really connect with Rey‚Äôs Journey. Her desire to be important in the universe and find a family are beautiful to me and I was rooting for her in all three movies. Finns arc about letting go of his fear was very relatable to me regardless of how John felt about Finns writing. Poe Dameron is my Han Solo, loved seeing him learn to be a real leader. I enjoyed the Hammy performance of Hux and the legitimate intimidation of Pryde. Snoke was a cool red herring like Dooku before him and I loved the Palpatine reveal. It felt like a much more fitting end for him to me.

Ben Solo however is my favourite Star Wars Character. Period. For one simple reason. I‚Äôve been where he is. During my edgy teens back in 2014-2018 I was involved in the anti sjw, alt right side of the internet and was taught too ignore sexual harassment, mock people different to me and to think that there was nothing wrong with how the world is while also being convinced the SJW where about to destroy my freedoms. I will forever be ashamed of who I was back then. So when I saw Kylo Ren. A similarly conflicted and corporated person be treated as a human being, capable of change and struggling to decide between power and love was extremely powerful to me. 

On top of just enjoying the movies they inspired me to pursue my passion for films and enter film school which has made my life so much better. These movies are my Trilogy and I will always hold them dearly.

So it is a little depressing to see them get so much hate. I understand why people don‚Äôt like them. But I always feel like there must be something wrong with me. Everyone else says they are terrible and they are probably smarter then me so what‚Äôs wrong with me.

62,Was Darth Vader aware that Rex was a Rebel?,1599201703,"I‚Äôm aware of the many ‚Äúwas Rex aware Anakin was Vader‚Äù questions but I‚Äôve never seen my question answered or asked before. The reason why I ask is because on my rewatch of Star Wars: Rebels we see Imperials identify Rex as a clone on several occasions. The first of which being on his introductory episode, S2E3 *The Lost Commanders*, and again in S2E9 *Stealth Strike*.

In *Stealth Strike* we see Rex sacrifice himself to attempt and save Kanan, Ezra, Sato and his crew. In doing so, he is captured and brought to the Imperial Admiral commanding the prototype Interdictor. There the Admiral identities Rex based on his CT number and attempts to execute him. Rex was then saved by Kanan and in the Ghost crew‚Äôs escape, the Interdictor is destroyed but not before that same Admiral escapes and eventually gets picked up by Agent Kallus who no doubt would want a report and learn that a Clone is helping the Rebel‚Äôs cause.

So from here I see two things happening:

* The Admiral assumes Kanan and Rex died from the explosion by being on the ship or too close to in while in an escape pod. This is unlikely and would be forgotten as soon as Kanan makes another appearance.

* The Admiral reports that they‚Äôre both still alive and that Rex specifically was helping the Rebels. More likely.

We know that Vader had an interest in this Rebel cell because of the two Jedi and Ahsoka so he probably would learn that Rex is helping them. From here, does it mention anywhere in a comic, book, short story or Q&amp;A session if Darth Vader knew Rex was now a Rebel? If so, what was his reaction?

74,What is the nature of the Force?,1599165781,"This thread is to begin a discussion about the¬†nature¬†of the Force¬†throughout the Star Wars series. From the Films to the EU and within the fandom, the ideas about The Force have been expanded on many times in various ways. I'm going to start with my own view but I want to hear any and all opinions and views on the Force.

First let me say, I was 7 when The Phantom Menace came out. I¬†was¬†introduced to Star Wars with the Original Trilogy, (thank the maker) but I grew up with the Prequels and during that time I loved them. As I've gotten older I have enjoyed them less and less but do still value them for the childhood nostalgia, (mainly TPM). Especially in the years leading up to the release of TFA, I have become something of an OT purist. Don't get me wrong, I'm not elitist. I love Star Wars in the most general sense and can find something to enjoy in almost any and all Star Wars, but for me the *unaltered* Original Trilogy is **the ultimate authority** and any other mythology, (atleast directly connected to the¬†""Skywalker Saga"")¬†**must**¬†harmonize with it. Unfortunately I haven't found that to be the case with the Force in practically any story after RotJ.

So here's the meat and potatoes. My view on the Force is directly and solely defined by the OT and what we learn from Obi-Wan and Yoda. I believe the Force is simply an energy field that connects all living things and binds the galaxy together. I believe that there are those that are born with either more or less natural ability to sense, interact with and manipulate it and that most anyone could, with training, engage with it in some way. I don't believe it has to do with blood or family lineage. Luke's RotJ dialogue about the Force being strong in his family is no different than saying a natural talent for playing music runs in my family. So of course, I don't accept midichlorians in my personal canon and I believe that it's a bunch of nonsense that Lucas came up with, which deviates from the original intentions. The Prequels, for me, completely destroy the mysticism of the Force.

I also don't believe there is some type of inherit morality or benevolent God-like intelligence to the Force. I don't believe the Force has a *""will""* or plan for the galaxy. And I think the idea of ""Balance"" in the Force is nonsense. This terminology is never found anywhere in the OT. Now, I do appreciate that the Sequels have gone to the effort of ditching the pseudo-scientific element from the Prequels and attempted to restore the mystical qualities of the Force, however they have held onto the ""Balance"" thing and also capitalized on the completely fan-concieved idea of the *""Light Side""* of the Force. Again, this terminology is found no where in the OT or even in the Prequels and I've never been able to figure out why it has prevailed in the fandom. I¬†**strongly** dislike the idea that the Force is somehow neatly divided into two moral halves with a middle ground between.

**To put it simply I believe there is the Force, which is a neutral energy that binds and connects all living things in the galaxy. I believe the Dark Side is a corruption of it that is brought about by evil beings who seek to use it for power, control and destruction, while the Jedi seek to use it for peace, harmony, knowledge etc.**

That's it.¬†No bloodlines, no balance, no prophecies. I know it probably seems a little contrarian but, I just disagree with almost every attempted expansion on the nature of the Force, outside of the original films.

80,Why do Jedi have different accents and some speak different languages?,1599164161,"The Jedi are taken from their homes when they are infants, some even as bailies. They grow up and most live the rest of their lives within the Jedi order, we've seen greedo Jedi and younglings that don't speak with the accent or language associated with greedo. How come the wookie and  the Ithorian younglings speak the language native to them but not the common language (maybe they can't and the masters had their tribe learn how to understand their language and vice versa) 

But why the hell does Aayla Secura speak with a Twi'lek accent? She didn't grow up on Ryloth and we've seen other Twi'leks speak without that accent. She literally grew up on courcsant with other younglings that spoke the common language. I don't think she even knows how to speak Twi'lek. I've only seen Obi-wan speak it but he is one of the few Jedi that does because he likes to learn languages.

I've heard some people say that they get their accents from their masters. For example Luminara and Barris have the same accent. But Obi Wan and Qui gon don't, neither does Dooku and Qui gon or obi wan and Anakin. Both Dooku and Mace Windu were padawan to Yoda and speak completely different, even though both were raised in the Jedi temple and had the same master.

You might argue that since Luminara and Barris are the same species (so are Dooku, Obi Wan, Qui Gon and Anakin but whatever) that they would have the same accent, but so are Ahsoka and Shaak Ti and they speak completely different. Plus ahsoka already had her accent by the time she met Anakin at 14.

And if anything The Jedi order is basically a society. They are all born in different planets but grow up receive the same education in the same planet at the same place, and share a culture. So all Jedi should have a common accent, even though many spend a lot of time travelling there should be a common accent (at least in human like species), yes they travel a lot, but most of them will spend the largest percentage of their life on courcsant. The most variation might be in Species that have a totally different vocal range like Plo Koon's. But there should be a common Jedi accent.

So like what would they do if Anakin wasn't trained, and or like falls to the dark side? he's still not a Jedi.

97,Fixing the Empire‚Äôs and First Order‚Äôs Biggest Mistakes,1599160997,"
Hello there,

After rewatching a few films, I‚Äôve come to notice that the Empire (and later First Order) tend to always make this same mistake:

Letting an unidentified (or suspicious) spaceship enter their Hangar Bay. Sending a few Stormtroopers and Officers to inspect the ship. And you know what happens next...

(The same thing happens in the TV shows too)

Hers the solution that I would propose:

Make a separate Landing/Docking Bay or Hangar on Star Destroyers for spaceships that are suspected to harbor intruders or threats. 

This separate section of the ship should be sealed with a deflector shield gate from the main parts of the ship. This would also prevent collateral damage to other parts of the Star Destroyer of the enemy ship explodes.  

They should also arm anti-air cannons and other large artillery in that Bay in case they realize the vehicle is a threat to the safety of the Star Destroyer. 

(The Trade Federation were smart enough to destroy the transport ship of Qui-Gon Jinn and Kenobi, hindering their escape from the vessel). 

What are your thoughts on this idea? Do you think that this plan would increase the Empire and First Order‚Äôs chances of success (despite the Plot Armor and The Force of the heroes)?",StarWars,LeGrandAmiral,False,/r/StarWars/comments/im07ba/fixing_the_empires_and_first_orders_biggest/

4,The ‚ÄúMary Sue‚Äù Fallacy and Star Wars,1599158506,"I have a question for you guys who in this franchise would you consider a Mary Sue? For a lot of people the term Mary Sue is ultimately associated with Rey. It‚Äôs not without its valid arguments, however I don‚Äôt believe a lot of people actually know what the term ‚ÄúMary Sue‚Äù means. I feel like a lot of people don‚Äôt actually know what it means instead use it as a basis to say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like this female character‚Äú.

Mary Sue - A character that is perfect in almost every regard, is sought after by the entirety of the cast (male or female), it‚Äôs absolutely required for the plot to even remotely move forward, and just perfect in every way.

Now this term comes from a Star Trek fanfic parody. In the story of a young woman named Mary Sue was the top pilot in the Federation. When she boards the Enterprise and Captain Kirk immediately finds an attraction to her. While she does say she‚Äôs not like other girls he still has an insane lust after her. She has thousands of awards and metals claiming she‚Äôs the greatest thing to ever walk in the bridge. The villains immediately go after her because she is just so important.

This fanfic would be the basis of the Mary Sue archetype and as a result more or less explains what a Mary Sue is like and why you should never write your character like this ever in any sort of fiction. The thing is when you read that very brief synopsis does that sound like Rey?

Aside from being women what do the two actually have in common? Is Rey touted as the greatest Jedi of all time? No not really. Out of all the characters I‚Äôd argue that Finn is the most important plot wise since he‚Äôs the one that tells The Resistance how to destroy Starkiller Base. You can argue that without Rey, Luke would not have sparked hope across the galaxy. That being said without Finn in the seventh movie there would be absolutely no continuation of the series after Starkiller Base was revealed.

Let‚Äôs move onto another aspect of Rey. Is she the best fighter in the galaxy? Absolutely not. We see throughout the trilogy that she gets her ass handed to her multiple times. Despite Kylo Ren being injured he was still overpowering her at the end of the seventh film. During the throne room battle she only defeated three of the praetorian guards and even struggled against them. The only reason why she defeated Kylo Ren during their final battle was primarily due to Leia reaching out with the force and calming her son down. I know this might sound like heresy but Rey isn‚Äôt the best lightsaber duelist. 

Now I‚Äôve got your attention I‚Äôm going to go over some key moments in the franchise and explain why a lot of people misconstrue Mary Sue to what I said it was earlier-

A Female Character I don‚Äôt Like
An Essay on Understanding a Character


Part 1 - Protagonist Journey 

If we were to look at each individual trilogy there is a very different arc for each protagonist.

Anakin is the chosen one, the most powerful Jedi to walk in the galaxy and without a doubt has to come to a realization that he is going to be evil. Simply because the future episodes need him to be Darth Vader.

Luke is the every man‚Äôs journey. He is just a normal typical 20-year-old man living his normal life when he‚Äôs sucked into a war and eventually becomes the hope of the galaxy.

Ben Solo is a misguided boy wandering between worlds hoping to find a place for himself.

Wait a minute, I thought Rey was the main character of the sequel trilogy. The thing is Rey is more of an audience surrogate. Think about it like this a lot of children don‚Äôt know the story of Star Wars. Even if their families are big fans and did watch it at a you g age doesn‚Äôt mean they understand the themes, characters, and writing of the franchise. For kids and teenagers who really don‚Äôt watch Star Wars she was a really great way of introducing them to the world that she exists in. That doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that she‚Äôs not the main protagonist it‚Äôs just that it‚Äôs not about her character.

Episodes seven, eight, and nine are all about the Redemption of Kylo Ren. He‚Äôs not the protagonist character but he is the primary character that the trilogy focuses on. Much like episodes four, five, and six Darth Vader is the character who gets the most development but Luke is our protagonist because guess what he still has an incredible amount of development as well. 

Rey‚Äôs biggest issue is the fact that while she gets development it isn‚Äôt until the last two films. While there is character within the seventh film you just more or less get the same thing from Luke and Anakin. A young individual on a planet isolated from the rest of the world and the inner machinations of the galaxy, just like Luke and Anakin. Unlike them however Rey‚Äôs character is never brought to the forefront until episode eight where her interactions with Luke really push her as a character. Once he starts pushing her in the movie that‚Äôs when you understand her character and how she evolves.

Anakin is an interesting character because in the first movie he is a Mary Sue. He‚Äôs so skilled in the force he‚Äôs the only human who can Podrace, destroyers the Trade Federation Blockade Runner, and build C3PO. I want you all to think about that for a very clear minute. He did all of this within the first movie and no one bats an eye. There is however a silver lining because in episode two and three they delve seriously into Aakin‚Äôs character to really flesh him out as a real person. So instead of him being a Mary Sue he changes into being a deeply flawed character by the end of episode two.

Luke on the other hand we identify with because he is a normal every day person who changes into the hero. He learns from two wise sage like characters to become what is possibly the strongest Jedi of all time. There is an argument to suggest that he‚Äôs weaker than his father but I don‚Äôt agree with that. If anything I believe Luke is the chosen one purely based on the fact he is so powerful in the force as opposed to his father who, well got cut down a few pegs. And while that might sound extremely boring Luke is put through so much within the three movies he‚Äôs in that it‚Äôs impossible to call him a Mary Sue.

The argument I‚Äôm going to make for this segment it however is that she is not needed for the story to progress in episode seven. Finn would more than likely escaped Jakku on his own. He wouldn‚Äôt run into Han Solo however he would have run into the resistance and help them destroy it eventually but there would be no episode seven or eight as we know them. Finn was needed to destroy Starkiller Base. Rey on the other hand wasn‚Äôt even needed at all she was just there to witness the death of Han Solo and to give her a reason to be angry at Kylo Ren for the rest of the series.

However she is needed for episode eight and nine because she is key component to Ben‚Äôs redemption. Without her there‚Äôs almost no redeeming him at all and as a result it becomes entirely different sequels. So while she‚Äôs not necessarily needed for seven she is needed for the two sequels. Luke is needed in his trilogy as well but at the same time it‚Äôs all about Luke and his journey. Without him there is no redeeming Darth Vader just like with Rey there is no redeeming Kylo Ren without Rey.


Part 2 - The Art of Dueling

Let‚Äôs be honest the prequel films have amazing choreography in the duels. They are by far the best in the series. You cannot get any more intense than the battle on Mustafar. The emotional weight of that battle is so intense but in the end almost everyone will agree it is by and large the best duel and possibly the entire series.

Same with episode six where Luke fuels Vader. It‚Äôs emotional and pushes both characters in different ways in the end it progresses the naturally as opposed to being forced into a destined goal. I absolutely believe in order to have an good duel do you need emotion. To be fair the sequel series has it as well.

Finn picks up the lightsaber in defiance of The First Order. Protecting his friends and his new alliance. Luke and Kylo Ren‚Äôs duel at the end of episode eight is extremely emotionally impacting primarily on Luke as he knows he cannot turn Kylo Ren to the light. Episode nine duel between both Kylo Ren and Rey is extremely important because it shows that in the end Kylo Ren absolutely still loves his mother and is still lost between the light and dark.

However the real problem people have is that Rey seems to be unstoppable in all of her so-called duels. To be honest I rewatched all of them and saw that they were incredibly wrong. Each duel shows that she‚Äôs not as strong as everyone thinks she is, she‚Äôs clearly struggling. 

In episode seven Kylo Ren has been shot by Chewbacca with his bow caster and basically is running on fumes. While he does defeat Finn and gets injured it doesn‚Äôt change the fact that during his fight with Rey he‚Äôs having problems. While he does overpower her sometimes he‚Äôs definitely seen better days. The only real reason why he lost was because Rey calmed her self down and then use the force to guide her as opposed to Kylo Ren who was using all of his anger to try and lash out at her.

In episode eight the throne room battle is intense but again shows her lack of skill. What was he does kill three of the praetorian guard‚Äôs she kills one thanks to Kylo Ren and nearly gets beaten by another in a one-on-one duel. On the other hand Kylo Ren was fighting three at a time and was able to defeat them. So very clearly there is a huge power between the two. 

Episode nine actually shows are being rather equal and that would make sense since she was taught by Leia. Well we‚Äôre all not sure what went into her training it can be theorized Luke trained her to be just as good as him but will never know. In the end she isn‚Äôt over powered in her duels it just shows natural progression of a fighting style. 

In the previous two trilogies we did see the heroes actually suffer immense defeats to their villains. Anakin got his arm cut off, Luke loses his hand to his own father, and let‚Äôs not even begin to talk about how much emotional damage was dealt to these people. I have seen the argument that she hasn‚Äôt lost a limb so that must mean she doesn‚Äôt suffer as much as them but that‚Äôs not true. She viewed both Han Solo and Luke Skywalker as father figures and let‚Äôs face it losing two different father figures can be extremely emotionally taxing and an episode nine she lost the closest thing to a mother figure. Physical and emotional loss are not the same thing but one will last forever with a constant reminder and the other will constantly remind you that you failed and you carry that weight with you for the rest of your life.


Part 3 - The Force Mastered

Let‚Äôs be honest with ourselves Rey is not a master of the force. There is no evidence to support this. She has only had about a year or two of training if that. Just looking at the other heroes in the franchise they had so much training and yet out of all three of them I would argue one was trained by a bunch of useless idiots, the other was trained by two wise individuals who still forgot teaching him things like how to redirect lightning. She was taught by two individuals who also didn‚Äôt know a lot about the force but just enough to get by. 

If we compare both Anakin and Luke there is a distinct power gap between the two. Anakin was trained at a time when the force was at its strongest in a good while. He was the chosen one who‚Äôs only rival could possibly be the two masters that taught him. He was considered so powerful that even his fellow Jedi begged and pleaded to just send him out there in defeat his enemies. Luke on the other hand had to deal with Darth Vader and well that‚Äôs not an easy feat as Vader did murder several powerful Jedi Luke didn‚Äôt really have an advantage over Vader inherently. Unlike Darth Vader‚Äòs master who has the power of lightning Luke got to deal with him the good ol fashion way of wacking him with a stick. 

Even then the force powers are rather different Luke was passive where as Anakin was more of an offensive powerhouse. Both had incredible powers but you didn‚Äôt see Luke overdo it with fancy twirls or incredible feats of strength in the force. Anakin on the other hand really overdid it with the force powers.

Rey on the other hand barely showed a lot of force powers in the sequel trilogy. We know she can lift big rocks and mind trick people. Pull a lightsaber towards her and stop on coming lightsaber blows with the force and jump good. Those are the extent of her powers in that‚Äôs not really a very large array of them either. When she was the lightning she‚Äôs extremely surprised she doesn‚Äôt even know where that came from. You have to remember that she used it briefly and never used it again. She‚Äôs not a Jedi master she‚Äôs still basically a Padawan. She‚Äôs not destroying ships with her mind she could barely even fight against a guy who basically swings his light saber like a bat. The two of them aren‚Äôt even finished their training let alone meant to be masters. It just comes across as if these two are playing in the backyard half the time.

Part 4 - The Internet‚Äôs Guide to Star Wars

If there is one thing that seems to bother me more than anything else it‚Äôs the inherent lying a lot of people do when they talk about the sequel trilogy and Rey. I understand that the OT and the PT are basically sacred cows by this point. The problem is the PT are the worst films in the entire franchise and you cannot debate this with me it is an absolute truth and a lot of fans agree.

We all remember the legendary reviews by Mr. Plinkett. They were at one point considered the de facto reviews of the PT and now people no longer refer to them as the definitive reviews. It really is surprising to see how one trilogy can change the opinions of another. So I had to ask myself why? Why did the opinion change?

The answer is honestly one that bothers me immensely. Simply Disney erased the previous canon and they now have a full-blown galaxy to flesh out. Legends is no longer a part of the new expanded universe instead it‚Äôs separate and a lot of people had a lot of nostalgia for this older series. Is that a reason to actually hate new Star Wars? No it‚Äôs not nostalgia is a powerful force in our brains and in our hearts and so many people cannot let go of the past.

Kylo Ren once said ‚ÄúLet go of the past, kill it if you have to.‚Äù 

That mentality is bad, we should embrace all of Star Wars. We should embrace the campiness of the old stories. We should embrace the serious undertones of the newer comics. We should appreciate the games that are currently coming out in this new age. Be extremely happy the re-release older ones too. There is nothing wrong with liking Star Wars nothing wrong with liking the PT or OT and there is nothing wrong with liking anything to do with Star Wars. That mentality is bad, we should embrace all of Star Wars.

For so many lots of people believe Disney ruined this franchise because they got their hands on it when reality George Lucas was damned if he didn‚Äôt and damned if he did. He couldn‚Äôt do anything without the fans screaming at him from across the room. In one moment he gained the exit he‚Äôs so desperately wanted. And now we have a new trilogy, new TV shows, and a brand new fandom that is growing up with this trilogy.

I for one welcome so many people into the fold and I cannot wait to show my children this franchise when they get old enough to appreciate this as well. I know this was a long post but I hope a lot of you understand where I‚Äôm coming from. I didn‚Äôt do this to hate on anyone I did this to educate so many people into understanding the trope they use to describe Rey.

It actually got me to think a lot about some of the stuff brought up in the article and why some problems arose.

* The coverage of what he said by the media is just poor in general. They took a comment about him wishing he had more to do in the movies and made it into how Disney is ruining Star Wars and misses the point of what he said entirely. It‚Äôs honestly hilarious to see people who were whining about characters like him previously now try to use him to defend their points, when it's people like them that are the one of the main reasons his experience was terrible.
* Finn was definitely sidelined in the Rise of Skywalker, but to me, it definitely didn‚Äôt seem overtly intentional like it‚Äôs made out to be. Finn‚Äôs arc was finished a little too early. Like a whole movie too early. In both the Force Awakens and in the first two acts of the Last Jedi, Finn was shown to be weary about being an active part of the Resistance. In the Last Jedi, he was being led in the direction by DJ to doubt everyone and that maybe there were no good guys. By the end of that movie, he was had completed his arc of officially choosing his side of the resistance, which is good for a movie arc or even a trilogy arc, but by completing it in The Last Jedi, it left him a static character in RoS, where all that we could see was him playing a more major role in Resistance missions.",StarWars,LanternRayner,False,/r/StarWars/comments/ilyp3s/just_some_random_thoughts_i_had_after_reading_the/

72,Back Boyega - Boycott MandoS2,1599135519,"It‚Äôs in the title, but really boycott Disney+.

Now first of all I do not want to cause any conflict, stir any mixed emotions of the different trilogies, or bring up any feuds or opinions.

We can all agree John Boyega as Finn was a character with so much potential and promise that was poorly followed through with and cast aside as the trilogy progressed. We all know why, as he said it himself, Ridley knows. Adam knows, everyone knows. Lucasfilms did not do any POC justice or even close to in writing these latest 3 films.

Now I know how much you love Mando. I love mando. I miss baby yoda; my PSN itself is Babie Yoda :(. But what Boyega said in his interview rings true. Lucasfilms has been biased or knowingly arrogant in how they‚Äôve gone about POC characters and their importance as relative to white cast. It is time for us to send a message! We hear you John! And we back you!

Assume half of the people who follow this Reddit have a Disney Plus subscription. That‚Äôs ~750,000 people. With the cheapest subscription that‚Äôs ~$5.2m/month. I implore every person to find 5 friends with a subscription and convince them to join this Boycott. 

And I know how much you love it that is why their should be end. And there is; on May 4th, 2021 we will break the boycott. But if 1 in every two people on this sub successfully brings five people on board. We will send Disney+ a message by omitting them $26m per month until they come forward with a plan to treat and honor the characters stories and promised importances. And in the grand scheme of things a little over $100m is not much to Disney, but it is a start, and it is a message!!

This is more than just any film. This is more than which trilogy best the other. This is about justice for a character whose destined unimportance was on the basis of the pigment under his skin. It‚Äôs vile, bluntly obvious, and down right wrong.

I am personally ending my subscription and I hope to watch Mando s2 via streaming online (maybe Popcorn time). I implore you to choose the moral guided side of this and join me.

At the end it is your choice and yours alone. Thank you for taking the time to read this and know your decision is not and cannot be judged. 

P.S. An advantage to joining this BoyCott if you really are on the line is you can wait for all of Mando s2 to drop them watch later on with a free subscription.",StarWars,xX0LucarioXx,False,/r/StarWars/comments/ilsapz/back_boyega_boycott_mandos2/

The prequels mention death sticks but they never show a full blown drug addiction like Kylo has. The drugs even keep him on the dark side.

When he throws his lightsaber into the ocean in the last movie it's like he's throwing away his addiction for good. I also think Luke discovered him doing drugs at his academy.

46,The Skywalker Legacy... an empty void of nostalgia and nonsense.,1599097531,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

Excuse my rambling but I just finished watching The Skywalker Legacy, a feature length behind-the-scenes documentary on the making of The Rise of Skywalker. I was so excited for it following similar ventures like Empire of Dreams, The Director and the Jedi, and the Mandalorian roundtables. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, what we got was nearly inane. A book-ending of TROS behind-the-scenes clips put through some filter to simulate 70's film grain and a sequence that opens the doc all about... Return of the Jedi. 

&amp;#x200B;

That is really a summation of what I found to be lacking in Abrams' films. An aesthethic understanding of what people like, but with no realization that there has to be a fundamental emotional element and spiritual nature regarding the films. Even the titling of the BTS - The SKYWALKER Legacy - doesn't delve into the Skywalker family at all. Leia, Luke, Ben, and Rey are there of course, but like they would be in any BTS clip. No mention of Anakin/Vader. 

&amp;#x200B;

The technical side of things - scoring, makeup, effects - was also extremely underwhelming. I'm not wowed by puppetry anymore. The use of it in the film? Yes. The actual technical nature of creating a puppet? No. Sorry, but no. 

&amp;#x200B;

The John Williams bit was nice and yes, it is fun to see old interviews of Ford/Hamill/Fisher... especially Fisher. But it just all rings so hollow when you realize, after finishing, the whole 90-minute venture was just an opportunity for some interns at Disney Plus to find their favorite clips of the OLD stars talking, mix them with filtered clips of the new stars doing exactly what the OLD stars did, and then waxing poetic about the nature of the 'writing' process while not actually allowing us anytime with Terrio or Abrams, unlike the Director and the Jedi, which showed tension between Rian Johnson and Hamill - a key part of the creative process that reveals why choices are made and how they serve the overall story. 

&amp;#x200B;

At the end, Daisy Ridley makes this lack of storytelling nuance clear. She's sliding down a Tatooine hill - not wanting to do the stunt because its a little silly - and getting told by the stunt director its a great way to end the trilogy. We meet Rey on a sled in The Force Awakens, we leave her on a sled in the Rise of Skywalker. Good choice, right? 

&amp;#x200B;

It's made apparent Ridley has not thought about this with any nuance. The point of this is not to critique Ridley at all, but to critique Abrams and Terrio for not properly breaking down their story choices and elements to the cast and crew, leaving everyone in an ambiguous state of knowing what their personal version of Star Wars is. That's great for a fan film. But Ridley - the key character - should know her character motivations as intended by the writers. It's plain they wrote it down, forgot about its meaning, then without consulting Ridley, shot the scene. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want something new from Star Wars. Or at least interesting. Both the film Rise of Skywalker and the behind-the-scenes failed to give this to me. The Mandalorian is familiar ground and not exciting to me but I'm looking forward to season 2.

50,About John Boyega‚Äôs recent GQ interview,1599095424,"A lot of the headlines and discussions about the recent GQ article on John Boyega center around Star Wars, because of they do. It‚Äôs the relevant keyword that‚Äôs driving the clicks on the discussion. But from what I read of the article, centering the discussion around Star Wars specifically seems to be missing the point.

What I took away from it wasn‚Äôt that this was an article *only* for John to rag on or vent his frustrations about Disney and Star Wars. I think what he and the writer of the article are ultimately trying to say is that the way his character (and the other POC characters) were treated is ultimately just another a symptom of the larger issue overshadowing everything. 

Sure we can go back and forth about the wasted opportunity of a character on screen, but what ultimately the most sad and tragic thing is that John wasn‚Äôt able to escape the real world pressures of racism in the galaxy far far away that gives so many of us so much joy. In the world that supposed to be for everyone, he and Kelly Marie Tran and Oscar Isaac were treated differently than their white counterparts. That‚Äôs so fucking sad to me that it hurts. This silly little universe of Star Wars can‚Äôt be an escape for them when it so easily is for others. These real world problems haunt them no matter what they do, no matter where they go.

So the article I think isn‚Äôt *just* about ragging on Disney or the writing or the directing. It‚Äôs about Disney and Hollywood and Star Wars as a microcosm of the macrocosm of struggles people like John face everyday in normal life. Racism, racial profiling, different racial treatment infect every single aspect of the world we live in in some way. Even in Star Wars. And we need people like John to keep speaking and sharing and driving the conversation to have the slightest hope of change and progress.",StarWars,C_The_Bear,False,/r/StarWars/comments/iljsv3/about_john_boyegas_recent_gq_interview/

59,Is it just me or is Merrin dropping hints on Cal after he successfully enters the tomb on Dathomir,1599091759,"First things first, context:

-Dathomirian society is ruled by females (Nightsisters). Males (Nightbrothers) are literally ferried from their segregated settlements to mate.

-Males distinguish themselves by violently (twoards each other/ twoards Dathomir's brutal fauna) *simping*. Meaning Nightsisters perceive strenght/cunning/resillience/determination etc. as predictors of *fitness* and encourage them in males.

-Merrin seems to be (developmantly) in her early 20' (or the Zabrak eqivalent).

-Socially, she is... blunt and rusty. Blunt because she did not have a society to adapt herself to as a teenager, spending formative years alone (Nightbrothers don't count). And rusty because whatever social skills she had, before the genocide, have (obviously from her interactions) fallen out of use and practice.

-Cal has *butchered* dozens of Nightbrothers, sveral Nydaks and killed a &gt;!*Gorgara*!&lt; before entering the tomb.

Now, what I've noticed:

-Immediayely after their first *actual conversation* not including death threats, Merin helps Cal enter &gt;!Melicos'!&lt; arena, gives him a chance to walk away, and *says she'll be watching*.

-In the tomb there's some non culture-specific [ship tease](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease).

-When asked about the platdorms, she answers she *wanted to see Cal fight*. 

-After Cal aquires the Mcguffin, and &gt;!she has offered to join your cause!&lt;, *it just so happens* that 2 Nydaks, *specifically noted to be solitary hunters*, are keen to *introduce themselves*. He, naturally, requests assistance. The answer is along the lines of *I'm sure you'll do just fine*.

-When it comes to the crew, she's only curious of who Cere is.

I wanted to see Finn purchase a new saber from some second-hand shop and learn to become a badass with it on his own without having to rely on the Force and stuff like that.

92,Diversifying the Empire,1599082176,"So disclaimer: I really don‚Äôt intend to offend anyone by this post but after watching the trailers for this game I just want to talk about how diversifying the empire makes them seem more normal and relatable when I thought the whole point of them was a thinly veiled nazi analogy we were supposed to dislike. 

So I‚Äôd been thinking this for a while but watching the latest trailer for Star Wars Squadrons made me bother writing it down.

I‚Äôve been a star wars fan since I was a child and grew up with the OT and was also lucky enough to grow up near a war museum. You don‚Äôt have to look at much Wehrmacht gear to see visual style of The Empire was inspired by WW1 and WW2 Germany and certainly by our portrayals of those evil people (don‚Äôt give me any bullshit about WW1 Germany being not that bad) on film. Imperial officers were played in virtually exactly the same way as the Nazis lots of very pasty white mildly aged emotionally cold aristocratic sounding officers stiffly marching around ordering whole prisoners to be executed and casually committing acts of genocide whilst emotionless pristinely uniformed goons followed their orders without question. Hell even the stormtroopers copied their names and stole half their weapons. They oozed not only villainy but the worst villainy our world has ever seen. 

On the other hand The Rebel Alliance has always been visually coded as the good guys. They haven‚Äôt always been as diverse as they could have been, but as the series progressed more women, POC, and any number of aliens were all added in. The more the merrier in my book. I love a diverse rebellion. The more diverse the rebellion is the more it hammers home the message that when everyone all comes together they can defeat evil no matter how powerful that evil seems to be and I can‚Äôt think of a better message for any work of fiction to carry. 

Now I‚Äôm not for a second saying all villains should be white nor that it‚Äôs inappropriate for POC or woman to play evil characters. Nor am I saying there were only ever white male Nazis/Imperial Germans. But I am saying it‚Äôs a bit jarring to see the Nazis in space hiring a lot of POC and women for their prominent leadership roles when their real life inspiration was so into eugenics and racial purity. I don‚Äôt get it. THEY‚ÄôRE THE BAD GUYS! IT‚ÄôS OK FOR THEM TO DO BAD THINGS. WE‚ÄôRE MEANT TO HATE THEM AND IN VIDEOGAMES TO SHOOT THEM ALL GUILT FREE. The Empire has previously been written as openly xenophobic to alien species so them being racist and sexist is hardly some great leap of the imagination. 

I find these attempts to humanise The Empire to just be bizarre when the films show them to beat, torture, and murder prisoners, commit genocide to make a political statement, and even punched a baby in the face in The Mandalorian so what point are they trying to make? Oh sure, they‚Äôll blow up a planet but they‚Äôd never be racist guys, they‚Äôre not THAT bad. üôÑ All this seems to do is visually suggest that The Empire aren‚Äôt actually that evil after all and why the hell would you want to do that with your villains? 

You can‚Äôt have it both ways Star Wars. You can either have the Nazis in space or think of some new inspiration for your racially diverse bad guys because the current half and half system just seems odd and is sending mixed messages.

52,Why I think Rise of Skywalker dropped a ball with Finn,1599068641,"Hey guys, so a lot of us have read the article about [John Boyega and his disappointment with his character in the sequels.](https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/culture/article/john-boyega-interview-2020) I think he makes some great points.   


A lot of people blame TLJ for sidelining his character, but to me the Canto Bight section, whether you think it was bad or not, set up a really great opportunity for Finn that I think ultimately got abandoned by Rise of Skywalker.   


So we see Finn in the first movie go from brainwashed trooper, to cowardly neutral-ish hero. His focus at this point is self-preservation, and saving Rey. Rey never needs to be saved, so he's really just about saving his own bacon.   


In part two, he goes on this side adventure to a casino planet. The big realization of this story arc, is that Finn realizes there aren't just good guys and bad guys, there are actually people who profit off the wars that are fought *between* good guys and bad guys. War profiteers are a kind of ultimate neutral, in that they don't care who wins or loses, because they'll be fine either way.   


This is the natural extension of who Finn would have become if it wasn't for Rose and Rey and the other heroes.   


In this story Finn realizes that war profiteers might actually be worse than regular bad guys, because they feed off the chaos that is sown in the galaxy. Now here's the thing - **What does that remind us of?**  


In Rise of Skywalker, suddenly, and for no reason, The Emperor is back. He's got a whole crew of Sith acolytes, and it turns out that he's trying to use the dyad of Rey and Ben to build himself up in power again. The sith ritual is essentially feeding off the power that comes from conflict to fuel dark magic.   


They never really expressly state this, but the Emperor has been doing this the entire saga - he pits sith against jedi to make the victor stronger, he pits separatists against republic, to make the victor stronger, he pits the empire against the rebels to make the victor stronger. At all points, he is trying to manipulate both sides, so no matter what outcome, he wins. **The Emperor is the ultimate war profiteer.**   


Here's the deal - instead of just saying ""The Emperor is back!"" in the opening crawl, Rise of Skywalker should have shown us how the heroes figure out that the Emperor is still alive. The story should have been about the pulling back of that curtain. Revealing that the First Order is just another step in the Emperor's plan to consistently pit factions against each other in order to sow chaos in the galaxy and reap the dark magic that comes from that violence.  


And this journey should have started with Finn making a [phlebotinum analogy (tv tropes warning).](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhlebotinumAnalogy)   


It's been a few years since TLJ, the heroes are still fighting, but Rey and Poe and everyone is frustrated. They're like ""man, how are the First Order still so well organized? We cut off the head of the organization and the only person in charge is Kylo Ren, and that guy is a mess!""  


They keep trying to strategize and then someone says something that makes Rose and Finn look at each other. ""Canto Bight!"" they both yell at each other in excited tones.   


From here, they both lay out to the rest of the heroes that there must be someone pulling the strings. That just like war profiteers on Canto Bight, there's somebody else involved here, propping the bad guys up. Taking their side and giving them power.   


And Rose and Finn lead the group in a new adventure to figure out who or what is at the centre of the First Order. Which inevitably leads to a reveal that the Emperor is alive.   


What this does is it makes Canto Bight plot meaningful, it makes it part of Finns journey from coward with a heart of gold, to cunning strategist, and it also ties the \*entire trilogy\* together, using the theme **that in war, the only winners are the neutral profiteers.** It would deconstruct the entire struggle across the galaxy and show that war itself is a fool's errand and that we are being pit against each other by shadowy powers that want to watch us kill each other.   


It would have made the trilogy of trilogies actually *about something*.   


I think this was a theme that would have been really effective, but it just got lost in the passing of this franchise back and forth between people focused on making one movie at a time. The series suffered because there was no voice stringing it together. Say what you will about the prequels, but those movies had a very defined arc.

Most of the speculations online always include Jedi knights and Padawans because a lot of people can't read, for some odd reasons so i decided to start a post that will compile the names that satisfy the requirements to be in the Lost Twenty :  


1. They must have been granted the Jedi Master rank by the Council, prior their leave.
2. They must have left the Jedi Order officially.
3. This list will include Legends and Canon, since this list was first mentioned in a deleted scene from ""Attack of The Clones"".

Just questioning why don't we reccomend in chronological order, I showed my cousin that never saw star wars in this order and she didn't lost any experiences, she was surprise by anakin becoming a bad guy (well she was upset as she said that she didn't liked the pretty boy being bad) and all of that stuff.

I have since over 25years (maybe around 30) 2 Metal little figures. - Link to Pics at the end of text- never seen similar figures (of course they are star Wars - one for sure from a endor/rotj set - but idk when or for what they where produced).

They are a little bigger then the micromachines figures from the 90s.

For diy the weapons imo are too detailed. The faces are not so pretty imo, i m really confused. No trademarks or things like that.

Maybe a tabletop game or something like that?

19,Phantom menace thoughts,1599019901,"My mind changes every once and awhile about what is the best prequel movie and at times I think that TPM is the best. I think does a decent job at giving us an introduction to a world where Jedi are keepers of the peace and are in a time where there has seemingly been peaceful for tens of years. I think the film does a good job at establishing this new era in the same world while still making it feel very new and fresh for audiences. Where the film falters is in its characters, not necessarily their development, but the overall ensemble of characters in the film. Obviously people don‚Äôt like jar jar and I think he‚Äôs been beaten down enough as a character, he‚Äôs bad and he‚Äôs given too much focus, the end. While I don‚Äôt like the choice to make anakin a child, I do think that some of the writing for his character is well done. The moments of him trying to help others and do the right thing is something that definitely works in my opinion. The actor is decent for what he was given and if moments we edited out, I think people would have been less hurtful in their criticism of him. Obi wan and Qui gon are pretty good. The wise master and eager, yet aware apprentice is something nice to watch. One character that always gets overlooked is captain panakka, who is always a treat on scene. Padme is probably the weakest of the leads behind jar jar for the fact that her duties as queen feel either too underwhelming or too drastic for her character to be doing. She starts off as a pretty bratty character and then is giving orders in the fight to take back her home. Their seems to just be an inconsistency with her. The most interesting thing about the film is the villain who has no development and just looks cool. While one of my problems is that the character of Darth maul never returns and is used as development for obi wan is frustrating but that‚Äôs not the problem with this film. The action for the most part of good, the pod race is fun to watch and the final fight is well paced, while a bit to choreographed for my taste but still a good watch. One of the scenes that feels the most important that is given no time at all of the first battle between qui gon and maul. This scene should be the moment where we as an audience feels some sort of danger and tension but is extremely underwhelming to watch. Overall I think TPM is the most watchable of the prequels and has the best story of the three, and while I‚Äôm not necessarily happy with its execution, I do think it‚Äôs the strongest of the bunch...at least right now lol",StarWars,Matyb954111,False,/r/StarWars/comments/ikzwn7/phantom_menace_thoughts/

31,Where does the Force end? Just the galaxy or whole universe?,1599017241,"I'm re-watching the orig trig and when I heard Obi-Wan say:

""The Force is what gives a Jedi his power. It's an energy field created by all living  things. It surrounds us and penetrates us; it binds the galaxy together.""

I realized that a galaxy is actually pretty small in terms of the universe. Originally I thought the force covered the entire universe of star wars, but it seems like it's more of an energy cloud localized in one galaxy (at least from the take of the movies).

I did some digging on wookiepedia and found:

""Dagobah was a planet in the Dagobah system, and one of the purest places **in the galaxy within the Force**. ""

""It interacted with the life **in the galaxy** through semi-sentient micro-organisms called midi-chlorians""


""The concept of The Force first appears in the rough draft of what would become 'A New Hope,' where it is referred to as ""The Force of Others"" and is first uttered by King Kayos. The second draft goes into more detail describing The Force of Others as consisting of two halves; ""Ashla, the good, and Bogan the paraforce or evil part. These terms would later be introduced into canon in Star Wars Rebels; first by the Lasat Chava who refers to the ""Ashla"" as **""the spirit of the galaxy.""**


These wordings all imply Lucas thought that the Star Wars galaxy is the only galaxy within the force. I've also found some references to the force being a universal thing, but it seems to be only in the EU in some sources, where there is also references to other galaxies.


I'm interested to hear your takes on it. Do you think The Force is a sort of energy field with a will of its own confined to a single galaxy (I wonder if Jedi would lose their powers if they left the universe too, if this is the case) or do you think the force is more like an all-encompassing universal thing (like the Tao, an omnipresent God, or Om)?


While I've always like the idea of the force being a universal thing, it raises interesting possibilities if it has a measurable finite border of a single galaxy.

If you could edit a line in to the OT to resolve/improve a PT retcon- what would it be?

- I would love if, before Anakin passes away, he called out for Padme (his love) and Ahsoka (his long who Padawan).  I specify their relationships because I don‚Äôt want to add this and then have Luke think his dad was a swinger in his fathers dying moments.  I think it would be a fascinating way to start a new story- luke and Ahsoka- and also give Luke (and leia) final closure on their parentage. 

- I would love for Leia to grieve the destruction of Alderan, specifically mentioning her adopted father.  In addition we‚Äôd need to cut the line where the sister kissing Luke says that he always knew Leia was his sister because ew.

66,A call to all Star Wars fans to rise,1599002228,"I just wanna open with this: I grew up with the prequels and the clone wars and I love them. I truly believe that Clone Wars is the best there is in terms of Star Wars media, you may not agree, but you are more than entitled to your own opinion and I will respect that. What I love about Star Wars is the fact that so many of us grew up with it, be it the OT, prequels or sequels.  Most of the people who actually like the prequals unironically as far as I know are like me (19 y/o) in their late teens or early 20s. We know that the dialogue is crap (but funny) and the characters feel flat; we like them beacause it builds the background for the original trillogy, the world building at least for me is what makes me gravitate towards them (CLONE WARS excels at having great characters, dialogue and world building), and also on the surface it's actually a deep story. Now before I start getting hell in the comments I just want to say I still love the Original trillogy (I try to watch it 2 times a year) the first time I saw A New Hope, I remember watching it with my dad he wanted to share something that was spacial to him with his son; He was about my age when it came out in theatres.

For me Star Wars was something I could bond with my dad, friends, cousins and so many others. I bet all of you have reasons you fell in love with the series. Be it you where a kid at a theatre in 1977, reading a star wars book in the old cannon when you were a kid back in the 90s, growing up watching clone wars and the prequels... or a kid who grew up watching the sequels.

This is what brings me to my point.  I don't like the sequels I really don't, and this is comming from someone who's watched Revenge of the sith like 10 times during quarantine. Force Awakens is ok in my book, but I'm still not a fan. But can we just step back from ourselves for a bit? I have younger cousins, nieces and nephews who love them, we can't really gatekeep Star Wars, that sorta goes against what to me star wars stands for. These kids are extremly lucky, they're going to grow up with so much Star Wars: Mandalorian, Rebels, Kenobi, Resistance, and ofc the Sequels. 

I've been thinking what makes star wars special to each and every one of us is that movie, that book, that tv show, that comic book or that video game that brought us into the franchise. I think empire is pretty damn close to being a perfect movie, but I still like my Clone Wars better. Why? Because it's what got me hooked on Star Wars. Loving Star Wars is like sex the first time is always special. To many of the kids the prequals is literally their first exposure to Star Wars. I remeber when I went to watch a New Hope I went with my older brother and saw so many young kids exited for it, it reminded me of the Clone Wars movie when it came out, I was just like them a 7 y/o kid exited to see Star Wars. My first exposure to Star Wars was watching the OT with my dad, but what got me hooked was the Clone Wars. How many of you where a kid when you saw your first Star Wars film? Wasn't that so special to you?

I¬¥m not trying to appeal to the diehard Star Wars fans that you are, I¬¥m apealing to the kid inside you that Star Wars brings out. We shouldn't shit on the new movies because we don't like them, instead we should take this as a chance to bond with the kids show them all there is to star wars like some of your parents did, or how  your older siblings or how you did with your kids. I have my problems with the new cannon like most of us do, but that doesn't mean we have to get rid of the new cannon, it's special to so many kids out there. I think this [picture](https://www.pinterest.com.mx/pin/621004236103252470/)  captures perfectly how powerful this franchise is to kids. I think Daisy  Ridley is an amazing role model to so many young girls and this just shows how impactfull her character is, she is bassically the mother of an entire generation of fans.

Like I said we shouldn't gate keep Star Wars it's not our job as fans. Our duty as fans is to show these kids all there is to know about Star Wars, show them the clone wars, show them the original trilogy, show them the old EU books and comics, show them the prequels, play the games with them, but don't fucking try to take away from them what makes the sequels special to them; Star Wars isn't yours, Star Wars is everyone's. I'm sad to see that this is what we got I think they could've done better, we could've gotten a trillogy about Jacen, Anakin and Jaina Solo or Ben Skywalker, but it's what we got, and we have to deal with that, beacause this is what the next generation of Star Wars fans got.

81,Thrawn: Chaos Rising gives us more details on why travel in the Unkown Regions is so difficult and how people get around.,1598998692,"&gt; The Chaos hadn‚Äôt always been that way, or so the legends went. Once, at the dawn of space travel, it had been no more difficult to move between any of the stars than it was now to travel in the Ascendancy. But then, millennia ago, a series of chained supernova explosions throughout the region had sent huge masses tumbling at high speeds between the stars, some of them demolishing asteroids or whole worlds, others sparking more supernovas with their near-lightspeed impacts. The movement of all those masses, coupled with regions of heavy electromagnetic flux, resulted in the constantly changing hyperlanes that made any voyage longer than a couple of star systems difficult and dangerous.

&gt; But that instability was a two-bladed knife. The limitations that stifled travel and thus helped protect the Chiss from invasion also slowed recon and intelligence gathering. There were dangers out there in the darkness, hidden worlds and tyrants who sought conquest and destruction.

This basically matches the Legends version of what happened. In Legends it was due to Celestials wanting to protect the galaxy from some of the horrors of the Unkown regions like the Mngall Mngall or Abeloth but obviously we don't know what it was here. It could be a war between early force users.

Just like in the greater galaxy the more used routs are more stable. And they don't need the Skywalkers for every trip just those that are more than system to system. Speaking of which we learn a sad little bit about how they test to see if skywalkers are still able to use their powers

&gt; There was no reason to have a sky-walker on this trip. She knew that. The routes within the Ascendancy weren‚Äôt like the ones out in the Chaos. Here, the pathways were clear, and the pilots knew how to get where they were going.

&gt;That was why the fleet had put Al‚Äôiastov‚Äôs test here. Trips like this were a safe way to see if a sky-walker could still do her job.

Also here are the two mentions of the sith and the war with the jedi

&gt;‚ÄúThere is.‚Äù He pointed down a hallway. ‚ÄúThe history of the Ascendancy is in these rooms, some of the pieces dating back to Chiss participation in the wars between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire.‚Äù

&gt;‚ÄúI seem to remember that era not being a particularly glowing time for the Ascendancy.‚Äù.... ""‚ÄúMost were purchased by various merchants and traders and subsequently donated to the gallery,‚Äù Thrawn told her. ‚ÄúSome are from species we still have contact with, but the majority are from aliens we encountered during the Sith Wars, before the retreat back to our own borders.

1,I wrote a plot for SW EP9,1598994019,"The title is ‚ÄòDays of Darkness‚Äô 

It place roughly a year after the battle of Crait where the First Order have dominated about 98% of the galaxy. 

Kylo wants to become a Sith, seduce Rey, and have her rule by his side over the new galaxy has Emperor and Empress.

Rey wants to complete her training, make her masters (Luke &amp; Leia) proud, train her new padowan (Finn), start a new Jedi order, bring Kylo back to the light, and discover who she is. 


This is just the first draft-


ACT 1 

Rey has found Kylo‚Äôs personal residence on Mustafar (Darth Vader‚Äôs castle) and has gone to kill him once and for all because she‚Äôs given up on him. This ends in a long and energetic lightsaber battle. Rey is forced to retreat after realising how strong with the dark side Kylo has become. 

Kylo decides to make a plan of action to ultimately - and finally - destroy the Resistance. So he returns to his personal destroyer using his new personal ship, The Huntress. As he arrives, he witnesses multiple star destroyers slowly destroying a planet called Xandore. The First Order are destroying all planets with Resistance sympathisers and/or those who stand against the First Order. 

He decides to make some changes. The First Order is now called the Sith Order. He goes on a hunt for Sith loyalists and teaches them the ways of the Sith. Hux is put in charge of a new trooper programme. Captain Phasma is reintroduced (with many scars) to the order as ‚ÄòCommander Sal‚Äôya‚Äô and is in charge of Kylo‚Äôs personal destroyer and personal army. 

Kylo goes to a planet called Raxor where he meets 3 Sith cultists. 

Meanwhile, on the far side of the galaxy, Thrawn is alerted of an ancient message from Darth Maul telling the people of the future a threat bigger than the Empire is coming. He is influenced by Maul and decides to help the Resistance. He infiltrates The Sith Order and collects as much intel as possible. 

Meanwhile, Rey is training Finn on a planet called Aydeaur. Leia has told Rey not to given up on Kylo. This is also where the Resistance‚Äôs base is located. Leia is made aware of planet being destroyed- Xandore. It‚Äôs one of many they had destroyed that day. They now get word they‚Äôre moving to the Rhanoy system, where they‚Äòre located. Thrawn arrives and introduces himself. As well as this, two Jedi padowans arrive who are part of a tribe called ‚ÄòHyan‚Äô. The First Order destroyed their planet so they fled here, where they found the Resistance. They tell the Resistance there are more Jedi padowans, and Jedi masters. Their planet was destroyed after they fled. They were split up. 

Kylo is made aware that Palpatine has returned as a ‚Äòsith ghost‚Äô and plans to go on a journey to wipe Palpatine‚Äôs contingency plans - which are scheduled to go into effect very soon - after he pays Palpatine a visit. His first stop is Vorix, where he meets Palpatine. Palpatine knows Kylo has much to learn so he becomes Kylo‚Äôs mentor. 

Leia sends Poe and Connix on a mission searching for allies. Meanwhile Rey and Finn go on a hunt for the remaining Jedi padowans after Rey sees a force image of a tribe. 

The ship is a rebel attack cruiser. It enters First Order galactic space. Instead of allies, they come across the First Order instead. They realise they‚Äôve entered enemy territory when they notice a fleet of star destroyers. 

After Kylo destroys Palpatine‚Äôs contingency plans, he returns to the Ravager and makes a speech aboard his dreadnought, giving his army an update on what‚Äôs left to conquer. He gets a message telling him Resistance soldiers have entered their airspace. He boards the Resistance ship with his Sith cultists. He slaughters all the rebels until he finds a valuable person and demands the location of the Resistance. Poe and Connix manage to escape and make their way back to the planet the Resistance are on. Kylo discovers the purpose of the cruiser‚Äôs presence and the Resistance‚Äôs location. He sends Phasma with his army to their location while Kylo returns to Raxor with his Sith cult. 

Meanwhile Hux is training his army on a dark planet called Vexis. 

Phasma wants revenge on Finn. She finds the Resistance‚Äôs location and orders an attack on the base. While they attack the Resistance, she sends a task force to kidnap Finn and hold him hostage. A battle on the ground, air, and in space commences.

Rey leaves Finn by himself with a task. He‚Äôs captured and taken aboard the destroyer. Rey returns, and when she realises he‚Äôs been captured, she tries to pull down the destroyer but the destroyer is stronger. Phasma and Finn meet again. Finn becomes a stormtrooper again. However, he discreetly recruits a group of allies and starts an uprising. He meets another force sensitive who helps him lead. This force sensitive was part of the ‚ÄòHyan‚Äô tribe but was captured.  

Leia wants to send a task force to infiltrate the First Order and rescue Finn. But Rey insists that it‚Äôs too dangerous, she senses Finn will be okay. 

Finn tries to escape with his allies but is stopped before they can leave. He is taken to a concentration camp on Nasar, a planet the First Order have dedicated to punishing traitors. Finn is put through an exhausting exercise so his body is weakened before his planned execution later on. The Resistance escape the Sith Order‚Äôs attack. While they‚Äôre in hyperspace they track down Lando. 

Phasma informs Kylo there was an uprising and The Resistance has grown surprisingly stronger. 

Kylo trusts Phasma to take care of the situation and stays on Raxor. He doesn‚Äôt want to be disturbed. 

Meanwhile, Hux informs Kylo the new troops are ready. He receives no response so he informs Phasma. She has tracked down Lando before the Resistance, so Phasma and Hux plot an attack together on Lando. 

ACT 2 

Lando‚Äôs forces attack the First Order in the hills, the water, the beaches, the sky, and in space.
The Resistance arrives just in time to save Lando‚Äôs forces from being crushed. 

Kylo arrives on Unara with The Huntress. He, the knights of Ren, and his Sith cultists, slaughter the Resistance soldiers. He comes across Rey and has a duel with her. Rey and Kylo duel while the Resistance and Sith Order fight around them. The Sith Order have the upper hand so the Resistance escape. But Kylo defeats Rey (Kylo‚Äôs saber is destroyed in the fight) and and takes her back to the destroyer. 

Kylo interrogates her, knows they have a plan and wants to know where they‚Äôre headed next. 

The Resistance escape the Sith Order with Lando‚Äôs forces and resort to an asteroid called Nuygur where they find the remains of the Republic. 

While in hyperspace, Poe comes up with a plan to rescue Rey. Poe, Finn and Chewie take a small ship to the Ravager. 

Poe, Finn, Chewie, and Rey try to escape Kylo until they reach a day end. 

Leia connects her mind with Kylo‚Äôs. She melts his brain, causing him to experience severe pain. This takes a lot of Leia‚Äôs strength. This allows Poe, Finn and Chewie to escape the Ravager. Leia dies due to a lack of energy. She died saving her friends. This fuels Kylo‚Äôs anger and motivates him to ultimately destroy the Resistance. 

He tries to use the force to pull the Falcon back into the hangar of the Ravagar. He fails at this and returns to his (Vader‚Äôs) castle where he (tries to) burn the mask and all his clothes. He goes to his wardrobe and puts on a black and red Sith robe. He also constructs a double bladed dark purple lightsaber. He is contacted by Palpatine. 

Meanwhile, Rey, Poe, Chewie, and C3P0 go to Nasar to rescue Finn before he‚Äôs executed. A battle commences. They escape just in time and return to the Resistance. The Resistance decide to go to Nuygur where they will meet the remains of the Republic while Rey, Finn, and all the Jedi go to a planet called Marseer 

This is where Rey wishes to complete her own training, start Finn‚Äôs and start a new Jedi order. This is where the last Jedi temple is located. It‚Äôs also where they meet Luke‚Äôs ghost who gives them guidance on how to find their kyber crystals. 

Finn and Rey find their kyber crystals, as well as their lightsaber parts on a planet called Kajor. 

Kylo goes to Riorskyn where he meets Palpatine‚Äôs ghost. He learns the Jedi are rising. He senses Rey and Finn are on Marseer. 

Rey, Finn, and Kylo have a force flash fight. Kylo is determined not to lose, so in his anger he reveals who Rey‚Äôs parents are. Kylo had known everything for quite some time. However, Rey uses her emotional response to defeat Kylo. 

ACT 3 

Rey, Finn, and all the Jedi return to the Resistance on Nuygur. 

Thrawn finally (discreetly) leaves The Sith Order and meets the Resistance on Nuygur, joining him are the Chiss army. The Resistance plot to destroy the Sith Order‚Äôs fleet. Using Thrawn‚Äôs insider intelligence, they become aware that the entire fleet is capable of being shut down from either The Ravager‚Äôs control centre or the watchtower on Cykliss. They opt for Kylo‚Äôs personal destroyer as it‚Äôs much easier. 

That night Kylo returns to his castle where he ultimately destroys his mask, lightsaber and clothes. He contacts his grandfather‚Äôs spirit. When he sleeps he dreams of Rey (not romantic) and is then ‚Äòtransported‚Äô to the world between worlds. 

While the First Order are ‚Äòsleeping‚Äô, The Resistance &amp; Republic infiltrate the Ravager and try to shut down as many things as possible. However, they are stopped by the Sith cultists. The Jedi and Sith fight, then the Resistance escape, regroup, and head to Cykliss for plan B. Leia sends out a call for help for any allies remaining to join the fight. 

CLIMAX 

When Kylo wakes up, he is informed his ship was infiltrated and is made aware of where the Resistance are headed next. He orders all ships to report to Cykliss. 

The Resistance arrives at Cykliss but is met by the overwhelming power of the Sith Order. 

When Kylo arrives, he boards the Falcon and fights Rey &amp; Finn. Finn is killed and the Falcon is shot out of the atmosphere which sends it plummeting down to the planet and crashes into a lake. 

Rey is the first to awake and heads straight for Cykliss watchtower, but is stopped by Kylo. They have a long and powerful lightsaber fight. After a while, troop transports are deployed to assist Rey. But at the same time, Kylo calls in Hux to deploy the new troops. Air support is also capped in on both sides. The duel continues while the Resistance have no chance of winning the space battle, even with the help of outside allies. 

When Rey is almost defeated, Kylo orders his Sith cultists to come and finish her. The new Jedi also arrive just in time. Aware that the space battle has been lost, Rey gives up on Kylo and musters everything she has left. She summons the Jedi of the past and an all out war on the ground and air begins between all remaining troops. 

The light fails. The dark side is too powerful. Rey is forced to use a powerful force ability to hold off Kylo for some time. She runs to the watchtower and attempts to shut everything down but Kylo arrives before she can press any button. 

Kylo attempts to finish her, but Rey uses the force to teleport to a planet called Gorran. This is a planet protected by the Jedi of the past. Kylo orders his entire army to search for Rey. But Kylo finds her first. 

When Kylo arrives, he is mentally fought by all the Jedi, but in the end he resists them. Rey realises how much stronger Kylo is and decides not to resist. Kylo kills her on the spot. 

Kylo returns to Cykliss where he concludes his conquest by reviving all the Sith. However, when Palpatine is brought back, he unleashes hell and tries to take Kylo‚Äôs empire for himself. But Kylo orders all the Sith to destroy him. Palpatine is ultimately destroyed. 

Finally, as ‚ÄòDarth Vex‚Äô, Kylo makes a speech in front of his entire army on his success and how he managed to destroy all the light in the galaxy.",StarWars,DarthNexun,False,/r/StarWars/comments/iksssn/i_wrote_a_plot_for_sw_ep9/

28,Jar-Jar in the Obi-Wan series?,1598987140,"I was rewatching TPM and realised how endearing I‚Äôve always found Jar-Jar. I can see how OT fans might have found him annoying in the 90s but as the prequels were my first SW films I‚Äôve always enjoyed his goofiness. 

I think one of the mistakes Disney made with the sequels was their unwavering stubbornness to try and appeal solely to the OT fans but they failed to realise that the majority of the fan base are now those who grew up with the prequels. 

With Ahmed Best now being one of the more beloved actors attached to Star Wars (appearing at cons etc) and how the prequel fans have rallied behind him after his talks about his immense struggles with mental health and fan hatred towards him, do you think an appearance from Jar-Jar in the Kenobi series could be a possibility? 

The two characters are well acquainted with each other and have a long history and the more modern CGI or prosthetics could really bring the character of Jar-Jar to a new level. I imagine his appearance would be little more than a cameo but I‚Äôd be interested to see him in a supporting role equivalent to Kuiil in The Mandalorian. 

Obviously I think Ahmed Best would be cautious or even averted to the idea of returning as Jar-Jar but it‚Äôs something that strangely enough I‚Äôd love to see.

I made a poor/wise mistake by selecting the Thrawn Trilogy as read by Marc Thompson as the first audio books I've ever listened too.

I read the trilogy when the first came out, but wow, there were a lot of details that I had forgotten, and the way the books are read is just amazing. Marc does a fantastic job!

Unfortunately as I near the end of the trilogy I have realized that there is not a vast wealth of un-abridged novels out there, and even fewer by Marc.

I was going to look at listening to the Jedi Academy trilogy or the X-Wing novels, but they are only in un-abridged forms, read by someone not as good, and have generally bad reviews. 

Suggestions?

The new Thrawn stuff seems ok at a quick glance, but I'd prefer some of the older material. I am not overly familiar with the Legacy of the Force books. Odd that he did he newest X-Wing book, but not the older ones; maybe he'll cricle back at some point.

86,Anyone else totally underwhelmed by the SW Celebration Online store?,1598969090," I was just feeling a bit Eeyorey about SW Celebration not happening. As a ticket holder, I had three days early access to the [Star Wars Celebration Store](https://shop.starwarscelebration.com/). In past years, I've seen some stuff that I really fun and original items that I liked and purchased, like the [Space Slug Jack In The Box](https://www.cnet.com/news/star-wars-space-slug-jack-in-a-box-wants-to-eat-a-starship/). 

The online celebration store has a bunch of very basic t-shirts that you could get in any Target. One of them is BB-8 as a mutant avocado. Is the joke supposed to be that Californians eat avocados and that BB-8 is shaped like an avocado? At first I thought it had something to do with pregante' fans. Then I realized probably not? Can anyone explain the joke to me? I almost want to buy one of the shirts *because* it seems like such a huge misfire. I can't imagine a world where there aren't eventually giant boxes of these unsold things being sent to developing countries like losing-team Superbowl tees. 

There's a suction cup mynock...but...it doesn't really look much like a mynock. And they missed a huge opportunity to make the suction cup look like it has the gooey elmers-glue gunk the on-screen mynock had in its...maw? Proboscis? Schnozzola?

There's a dead tauntan stuffee that you can stuff a frozen Luke stuffy into its belly...which...alright. That's kind of funny and stuff. 

But...there's no jazz here. It's stuff you could get anywhere. No exclusive figures, no real treasures that I can see. Certainly nothing I would buy at full price. 

I don't want to be too hard on the organizers. I would imagine lots of plans got scuttled when the lockdown happened, including plans for merchandise. They probably just flat-out didn't make the stuff they were going to, or didn't even develop it because they guessed correctly that the convention wasn't going to happen. The items they have posted (so far?) seem like a virtual cut-their-losses clearance rack. 

As someone who had tickets...I was still looking to pick something up to memorialize the SW Celebration That Wasn't. They could call it Star Wars Non-Con...or Zero-Con...or, I dunno, something more Star Warsy like Star Wars: The Viral Menace or, y'know. Something gooder. 

Anyhow. NBD. Hopefully, in two years, we'll be able to make the con safely happen.

3,Some discussion on the changing nature of the Jedi and Sith; the relationship between Sith and Empire; and a question as to why some characters treat the Jedi as an almost mythical group?,1598962239,"New fan here. Watching through the films for the first time and enjoying it. I've just finished VII: The Force Awakens so please no spoilers for movies released after that. 

These thoughts first popped into my head when I rewatched the first trilogy in Episode IV A New Hope, and now in VII they have just come back even stronger.


In IV, Vader and Obi-Wan are the only force users I recall featuring in that film. 

Also throughout IV, at odds with the other films, Vader seemed to be both a part of and separate from the empire - with his precise place in the chain of command not made clear. He seemed to tussle with both the lower commanders and to a lesser extent Tarkin for authority. 
One of these tussles culminates in an Empire commander sassing Darth Vader for his faith in an ancient religion and consequently getting force choked for it.

The precise relation between Vader and the Empire did not seem to be fully revealed to us... As if the empire was its own thing and Vader was working through them, not as the leader of them. The empire seemed to accept Vader's immense personal power while not quite accepting he had equal political power in the formal hierarchy. Vader was perhaps an agent of the Empire without necessarily being part of the empire. Who was using who here? To what extent did their ultimate goals align? There was in my opinion, a bit of mystery to their relationship. 


When we move on to V it's clear that Darth Vader is now the big boss of the empire and anyone in the empire chain of command challenging him or even doubting his judgement is now portrayed as something that wouldn't happen. There are also two new long time force users added to the cast in Yoda and Emperor Palpatine. 

By Episode I, set approx 30-40 years before the OT, it seemed force users were now in the hundreds or thousands, and it was basically the norm.

My original conclusion to this sequence of developments was that it was essentially a series of retcons. In EP IV, the writers were originally going to go down a different path, with both Jedi and Sith being near mythical and Vader manipulating the Empire as opposed to it being formed specifically as a Sith project, with the writers changing their mind in V to make the Empire and the Sith basically one and the same and to narrow the focus of the story down to the key force users, essentially the Skywalker story. Then again changing their mind in I to make the Jedi more prominent than they had previously been suggested to be.

But my theory of it being a series of retcons is now undermined by VII, as at one point when Han is first reintroduced, there is an exchange that goes along the lines of ""yes, the Jedi are real, so is the force, I once didn't believe it too"".

How is such recent history as the events of the prequel trilogy already forgotten and become myth by the time of the OT, and how does it still persist in the ST, even when it's already established in VII that force users like Luke had returned and he was training new apprentices.

Does news just not travel in Space? 

And back to the other point of the differing relationship between the Sith and the Empire in EP IV, just for fun, does anybody else kind of wish we got to see more of Vader and the Empire with this dynamic? I feel like it could have made the empire a lot more interesting and nuanced then they ended up being, with Empire authority figures eventually existing primarily to get Force Choked killed by Vader whenever he was in a bad mood.

Primarily just asking these questions as a fun  point of discussion. Not criticizing or trying to pick holes if thats how it comes across.

Question for other (more knowledgeable) fans: 
1) is this a common thing that people feel/take issue with? 

2) is this perception wrong/right or rather is it justified? (I thought I learned that Lucas meant for the PT to expand on Anakin‚Äôs backstory and fall - but i don‚Äôt know if he intended for the focus of the trilogies to shift focus)

3) I don‚Äôt like this perceived shift, should I get over it (ie that‚Äôs the story George wanted to tell) or is there a way to like both parts of the story, but with a more separated lens?

47,My version of the sequel trilogy,1598928544,"I really like a lot of the ideas in the sequels, but they just don‚Äôt make much sense all thrown together, I‚Äôve said it before so I‚Äôll sum it up but basically TLJ had cool ideas that didn‚Äôt make sense within context of TFA and TROS just made some dumb mistakes. So 

**THE FORCE AWAKENS**
Mostly the same, except Rey is less of a Mary Sue, and like Luke in ANH Basically doesn‚Äôt have any force ability, and loses her fights against kylo

**TLJ**
I like the concept of ship chase movie, but It just doesn‚Äôt work for that movie, so scrap that and replace it with more Rey training and Finn learning the force. Rey could actually learn things for real this time, and to justify her crazy power luke could say something like ‚Äúyou have more midichlorians than my father!‚Äù Or something, Finn Has a side story of going and finding Jedi in hiding and learning from them, preparing him to become a gray Jedi, because it would be kinda boring to just have 2 Jedi main characters, he also plants seeds of rebellion in the storm troopers during the scene with phazma, showing the troopers around her hesitant to kill him and looking around, distressed. The final scene stays the same minus Finn sacrificing himself and rose, leading them to escape just in time to a new rebel base, we get a scene explaining more if snoke and him being Pissed AF about the resistance escaping.

**TROS**
The worst of the sequels IMO, with only a few good ideas in it. First of all, kylo just becomes a good guy at the start, and hux joins him. Rey during the story gets him to turn back to the light side properly, getting him to unlearn his sith ways of anger and hate. Palpatine is replaced with snoke, who is a failed clone of him with even more power then him, but without the whole ‚Äúall the sith‚Äù thing because it contradicts the whole point of force ghosts and the irony of sith Vs Jedi. There‚Äôs still a final battle with Rey getting knocked out and kylo dying, but without the making out and kylo just dies after falling in the hole.

* The War lasts for 16 years, which is too long for a single trilogy.
* Should the War be portrayed from Revan's intervention in the War, which means it would last 4 years? 
* The Clone Wars 2008 TV Show was more effective in detailing the 3 year long war than the Prequels.",StarWars,Wrighted-2000,False,/r/StarWars/comments/ikbyur/if_lucasfilm_adapted_the_mandalorian_wars_how/

56,My Rendition of Empire Strikes Back,1598926045,"Phase I   
The Galactic Empire recoups after the Death Star. Uprisings have been occurring for the past three years on worlds like Coruscant, Naboo, etc. We transition from the crawl to a scene of Stormtroopers attempt to quell the uprisings. (Example of what kind of happened in TFA) Then we cut to Luke trying to convince Leia on their new base. Luke wants to help the planet that is revolting trying to get other worlds to join the rebel alliance, something that Anakin would have done like father like a son. Still, Obi-Wan appears stopping Luke in his tracks, teaching him that it isn't the Jedi way and that he should head to Yoda on Dagobah. Ps. Han is nowhere to be found, and the base the Rebels have isn't Hoth.       
Phase II    
Luke arrives on the planet Dagobah. We get to see some actual training with the sabre, and as the lessons go on, Luke passively learns that Vader is his father by Yoda and ask Obi-Wan why he never told him just like episode 6. Still, as all this happened, we skip back and forth to the Empire trying to strike back and trying to find rebels new base. Ps. Most of this Phase will spend time with Luke and Yoda.        


Phase III   
Empire locates the rebel base, Vader contacts the mysterious emperor asking what the plans for attacking. We cut Luke leaving Yoda because he finds out that Leia is in trouble during meditation. He then heads out to find Han for guidance and help. When Luke finds Han, the Smuggler is out with Lando &amp; Chewi gambling. Luke tries to convince Han by snooping to his ego about the Death Star, saying that it wouldn't have been destroyed if you never came back to help. Lando, of course, tags along because he learns about Leia same reason why Han helps in episode 4, But it was her not her money since Lando is already rich. The 4 head back to the rebel base mid-battle. Luke goes to confront his father in a proper dual since he has been appropriately trained but still fails since he left too early and loses his hand. His sabre off a cliff then the film ends with the Empire winning but the rebel Alliance escaping and the structure of the second death star as a teaser to what up next episode.",StarWars,Dogsteeves,False,/r/StarWars/comments/ikboi8/my_rendition_of_empire_strikes_back/

71,Anyone else sad about the loss of the Seven LightSaber forms and knowledge of LightSaber combat throughout the course of the movies? (Light spoiler warning),1598919947,"In the Prequel Trilogy and Clone Wars series we saw Jedi in their prime, before the rise of the Empire, Jedi Knights and Master's all using displaying different levels of mastery, using all the seven forms, we saw Masters like Yoda, Dooku, Obi Wan, Mace Windu, and Anakin Skywalker. Each with a mastery over different forms, different fighting styles and Philosophies, etc. 

Come to the Original Trilogy and Rebels era where the only true Masters left are Darth Vader, Obi Wan, Luke Skywalker, Palpatine, and Ahsoka Tano, and Maul, Ezra, and Kanaan however not all of them make it to the Trilogy. Vader with his MMA-esque fusion of multiple forms with his base of Djem-So, Luke with a mix of Forms 1,3,4, and 5 who'd be one of the only to make it through the Orig Trig has forms 2, and 6 missing and perhaps lost to time. 

And even further to the Sequel Trilogy where the only two LightSaber Wielders are Rey who was mostly self taught, and used the force to guide her until her brief time with Luke, and her training with Leia who most likely taught the same Luke Skywalker mix, and Kylo Ren who seems to use a bastardized mix of Forms 1, and 5 (at least it seems that way in my opinion) and come the end only Rey is left with her incomplete mishmash of whatever Leia managed to teach her.

So come the end of the Movies Form 7 both the Sith and Jedi Variants are gone with Palpatine, and Mace Windu as their only practitioners long dead, Form 6 as well is gone, the Skywalker Variant of Form 5 that Luke learned fighting Vader is still around, as well as 4, and the basics of 3, Form 2 seems to be gone, and again the basics of Form 1 are all that's left of the Seven forms of LightSaber combat. All the lost knowledge and teachings is honestly kind of heartbreaking especially seeing as The Last Jedi Rey Skywalker is still a novice in comparison to the Masters of old. 

Excuse my ignorance if I got any facts wrong, also I am not a Rey hater it's just that as a duelist her skills are lacking in comparison to the Masters who've long since passed.",StarWars,WierderBarley,False,/r/StarWars/comments/ika3ce/anyone_else_sad_about_the_loss_of_the_seven/

the first one being: People‚Äôs problems with the prequels are the opposite of what people‚Äôs problems are with the sequels. the prequels problems are (mostly) surface level. the acting and the dialogue is bad, the cgi didn‚Äôt age well, lack of chemistry among the actors, etc. but if you look at the writing and structure and the storytelling, there‚Äôs a genuinely good story in there. 

the sequels have good dialogue, great cgi, and great chemistry among actors. but if you look at the storytelling, it just doesn‚Äôt work. because everything contradicts itself, each film is formulated to undo what the last one set up. imo, it doesn‚Äôt work. 

reason two: Social media. during the prequels, there wasn‚Äôt a lot of social media, and it wasn‚Äôt as common place; kids could go to school and tell their friends about how much they loved the new star wars movie that just came out. but with the sequels, kids can go online and see videos critiquing the sequels, and social media posts saying that they‚Äôre bad. these kids can look at these videos and thinks about some of the points brought up, and realize - they didn‚Äôt really like the movie. 

and third: there‚Äôs a lot more entertainment for kids these days. not just star wars, like in 77-83 or 99-05. today, kids have the mcu. which, i would argue is the star wars for this generation; as from my experience, with the kids i know (my cousins, younger sibling, etc.), most of them don‚Äôt care about star wars as much as they do the mcu. a lot of the kids i know we‚Äôre very excited for the new star wars movies, but after the last jedi (once again, in my experience), these kids stopped caring about star wars and most of them, (again, the ones i know. i‚Äôm not saying this is the majority, or that this is the minority, because i think it would be impossible to quantify the size of SW fans who like and dislike the sequels), didn‚Äôt even see tros. and, most of them wouldn‚Äôt care to. but most of them have seen all the mcu movies, and love them a lot. so, i think that the mcu is more influential to the kids of this generation. (again, again, so nobody gets mad at me: this is just my experience.)

so, that‚Äôs why i don‚Äôt think the sequels will be as loved as the prequels in the future. if you have counter arguments, or add ons to what i‚Äôve said, i‚Äôd love to hear them. have a good one.",StarWars,camdensparks,False,/r/StarWars/comments/ik2uq6/i_dont_mean_hate_to_people_who_like_them_but_i/

Jar Jar travels with Senator Kharrus to deliver the ransom. In the episode, the ship holding the Senator and Jar Jar is being shot at. Jar Jar is being his usual ""clumsy"" self and cannot secure himself. As he's bouncing around the cabin, he ""accidentally"" causes the co pilot to temporarily leave the cockpit and may have inadvertently caused the ship to be shot down. During the crash, the Senator is thrown from his seat and dies.

I thought it might be interesting if Senator Kharrus was a proponent of the war or maybe wanted more oversight to the cloning process, aka the inhibitor chips. The Chancellor (Darth Sidious) sent Jar Jar (Darth Jar Jar) and Kharrus on this mission, knowing that something may go wrong and the true purpose was to remove Kharrus without looking suspicious.

While I much prefer the character speaking with the actor's natural accent, do you think it will be jarring when compared with the other media? Will Rebels Wedge be dubbed over? Does the stress of blowing up two Death Stars turn a man Scottish? Will the warthog general dude from the Clone Wars remain the only Scottish accent in Star Wars?

8,Anakin is the best,1598877836,"I love how the more you rewatch the movies and watch the tv series you can fully understand why he did what he did.

His life and home betrayed him, causing him nothing but pain and anger. His padawan left the order despite his hard work and through no fault of his own. The order cast Ahsoka aside and gave a half hearted apology when she left. The jedi way took away the only person he loved who betrayed him. His best friend betrayed him. All he ever knew caused him pain and anger. And when he needed them most they didnt trust him. They shunted aside his potential because of their lack of trust. 

After he turned he was bound by his anger and fear and palpatine power over him. He saw the foolish ways of the jedi and couldn't bear to see his son so certain he was right. He tried to have his son join him, only to be treated like a traitor and liar.

59,An alternative explanation for the Holdo maneuver.,1598853911,"In Star Wars, the term ""shields"" refers collectively to multiple defense mechanisms: fields that defend against matter intrusion (think of the fighters that blew up when impacting the shield of the second Death Star or the shield on Scarif) and fields that block plasma and energy weapons (like the shields the Gungans use).

Hyperspace inherently opens up a bunch of tactical possibilities (like super-destructive ramming) that we don't see in most battles, so it stands to reason another defensive capability that falls under the umbrella term ""shields"" would be some type of hyperspace shielding, like miniature interdiction fields¬∂.

It also stands to reason that a field that blocks stuff traveling in hyperspace would interfere with an active tracking system that tracks ships through hyperspace. Active sonar wouldn't work if you surrounded your ship in a sound-proof bubble, would it?

Maybe Holdo came to the realization at the very end that the only way the First Order could track them through hyperspace is if they lowered their own hyperspace shielding. That would leave them vulnerable to tactics that had been rendered obsolete long ago such as hyperspace ramming.

If you want to add some more head-cannon spice to the explanation: Maybe, even without hyperspace defenses, pulling off a hyperspace ramming maneuver is still extremely difficult because you have to exit hyperspace right when your ship intersects the enemy otherwise you'll pass right through them like a ghost. This is why it required extreme precision for Han Solo to penetrate the Shields of Starkiller base without ramming into the planet. Hyperspace maneuvers are simply difficult to pull off with precision bellow +/- 100 km (using [Earth's K√°rm√°n line](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n_line) as a reference).

It may have been Holdo's skill or just luck that she only had enough fuel to get her an intersection with the Supremacy . She jumped to hyperspace, ran out of fuel, then transitioned back into normal space right as the Raddus made contact with the Supremacy. In mid-transition it would have enormous momentum from traveling faster than light (practically infinite).

If it was luck, well, a big part of The Force is the manipulation of 'luck'. It allows very improbable events benefit the force user. Maybe The Force was with her?

Any Sci-Fi mechanism that allows faster-than-light travel or even near light-speed travel implies that the most powerful weapons are the ships (or hunks of matter) themselves (among many other violations that would, [if you think about it too hard](https://youtu.be/msVuCEs8Ydo), would ruin the story).

To those who lament about how the Holdo maneuver ""broke"" Star Wars: It's all fantasy. The rules of the SW universe could *never* be self-consistent. We can't even work out a consistent model of the real universe! Expecting completely self-consistent rules from a fantasy universe where those rules are mangled and space wizard samurai are thrown into the mix? That's just silly. Inconsistencies were always there, you just didn't think about them (probably because you were much younger, had a much more active imagination, and were able to suspend your disbelief and just have fun when you watched the originals).

Also, it's an incredibly beautiful scene.

¬∂ I don't have extensive knowledge of the ""legends"" or the canon extended universe for that matter, but [according to wookieepedia ](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Interdiction_field): interdiction fields are an invention of the Empire. However, interdiction fields are also described as the ""projection of an artificial gravity well""  and repulsorlift  technology is described as an anti-gravity technology, so it seems the technology to manipulate gravity is quite old. I propose that the new technology the Empire developed in interdiction fields is the ability to create large wells over a long distance.",StarWars,arachnivore,False,/r/StarWars/comments/ijspiv/an_alternative_explanation_for_the_holdo_maneuver/

71,ROTS opinion,1598849257,"Having rewatched ROTS I personally think it‚Äôs a pretty bad movie with decent and some good moments. The opening is mostly strong, it lasts way too long but its pretty good up to the point where they free the chancellor, everything after that is mediocre. The love between anakin and padme is never done well and the only good moment of their love is when their separated before order 66 and when he chokes her. Obi wans side story never finds its footing and feels like a bore to watch due to general grevious being an Uninteresting character(should have been dooku but I get that anakin kills the apprentices I become the apprentice). Yoda vs palpatine isn‚Äôt that good and I it symbolizes the Jedi and the sith but takes away from the really frantic story of obi wan be anakin which is so much stronger. As a lover of film the way the film is paced is really strange as well, with wide shots of people walking for long amounts of time make each scene so strange to watch. I‚Äôm not gonna knock on any of the performances just because I think some of them are genuinely good while others lack cause of Lucas‚Äô direction. The best scene is the Darth Plagueis scene is the best single scene in the film. Order 66 is well done but lacks any emotion when the Jedi die, the emotional parts of Yoda feeling the death of the Jedi is good and the shock factor of anakin going to kill you flings is more of a question mark than a gut punch. Overall I think that ROTS has its hands tied by its own creator and because of that it unable to breathe and let an audience member like me follow the fall of anakin which as a plot summary is solid. I will say the ending with the twins is a perfect ending to the film. Revenge of the sith has a lot of potential in its story but in its execution it‚Äôs its own worst enemy.

2,Most underrated SW film,1598830822,"Hi guys i just wanted to ask what SW film you find you like outside of popular opinion/is underrated in your eyes. 

For me its Rogue One. IK alot dont like it but for me its exactly what you would want in a direct prequel to episode 4. The story makes sense (they build a massive space station with Galen Erso being a integral part and when he realises its a superweapon he quits setting them back over a decade). The character relationships make sense imo, they never truly trust Jyn Erso but they realise they need her to help find Galen to kill him so that the Empire can never reacquire him to speed up the building process of the superweapon, and theres real tension all the time in the rebellion, which makes sense as multiple rebel cells of different beliefs and cultures are never going to get along all the time. I also like this movie because its free of any plot armour. similar to why Avengers Infinity War was so good, the main heroes could die, yes they escaped with the plans after THAT vader scene but that made sense, vader was slowed by his suit so he couldnt just run after them. But there was no insane unrealistic part on the ground assault, the heroes could die, and for me personally that makes a very good movie most of the time because it feels more real and makes more sense. Also, that vader scene is probably my favourite star wars scene. Just over a minute of vader tearing everyone down not stopping at all, with the rebels desperate to get the plans on board the shuttle safely. It also makes new hope better i think because until you watch rogue one i feel you dont really appreciate how valuable those plans are for the rebels.

Something that has always been a talking point for people who don‚Äôt like Solo (I am not one of them) is that they covered almost every possible origin point for Han in the movie . How Han got his blaster, how he got the Falcon, how him and Chewie met, how/why he got his last name, etc. 

I couldn‚Äôt help but notice a correlation between that, and the opening sequence from Last Crusade.  

Young Indy stumbles upon the cross of Coronado, and adventure ensues. During this whole sequence, and it‚Äôs just the beginning of a longer movie mind you, we learn how Indiana also got most the origin points about his character. Why he‚Äôs afraid of snakes, how he learned to use a whip, how he got the scar, where he got the hat, and so on. We also learn later about the origin of his name. 

My point is, I wonder if this puts a different perspective toward this topic of contention with people who make this one (of the usually many) reasons you don‚Äôt like Solo. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs a perfect movie, but I for one love it and never understood why people hunkered down into this topic as the reason for not liking it.

56,I think I figured out the Core of why so many of us are indifferent or hateful of the Sequel trilogy.,1598792366,"And its a pretty simple one, Character building.  


I recently watched all the old Star Wars movies again and what I found that was such a stark difference from the old movies and the new is how much better the characters were developed in the old movies. I don't know exactly how George did it, but by an end of just one movie (new hope) I genuinely cared about the fate of the characters. By the end of The Rise of Skywalker, after 3 whole movies, I still didn't care at all that Rey was dying in the last scene, It carried no emotional weight at all for me, I was actually more sad to see Kylo go. A guy who commits genocide in the first scene of the trilogy.. .  


That's also WHY I think why many of us loved Rogue One and the Mandalorian, because somehow through writing we deeply loved and cared about the characters by the end, I was in tears when the force sensitive blind man was dying in the arms of his best friend, I was genuinely moved by the sacrifice of K-2SO. I felt the deaths of all the rebels slaughtered by Vader, and in turn their sacrifice gave greater depth and meaning to a new hope. The sequels there was none of that, unless they were mindlessly assassinating my childhood characters.  


I guess for me it came down to the fact that the sequel movies had some great moments, and they were somewhat fun, but at the end of the day, the story just doesn't work if you don't really care about the main characters. The orly movies and some of the sequel spin offs made me care, the sequels didn't.

57,Dear StarWars producers,1598792252,"There is a lot I could say... and I mean a LOT. An avid fan of Star Wars, 25yrs old, and was properly raised by being shown ""A New Hope"" in my early kid years üòÄ 
I've read some comics, and some books growing up, and even the good portion of Star Wars toys from year to year! Just overall, a fan, and a happy one! I'm not here to bash on Eppisodes 7, 8, and 9, but to share a request. I feel that most, if not all, the friends, family, and just other fans share this desire, and it's simply to have more Non-Skywalker saga material given to us. Content that isn't tied to the main series, content that explores the wide, vast, and rich lore of the large Star Wars universe! Rogue one? Awesome :) Mandalorian? Great! And we want more! Maybe even material that strays FURTHER than these two examples even! I hear a lot of main series and side series (Clone wars, like Ashoka) characters will be shown... and that could possibly be cool... but I feel like we don't need them! Star Wars is teaming with cool planets, ideas, groups, and adventures to either be discovered, or created new!
""The"" Mandolorian is such a cool and suprisingly dynamic/deep character all on his own! Not needing a suprise from Maul to spice it up.
I have no intention of making this too long and drawn out - the examples I could give are too numerous.

All I would like to try and drive home is the idea that many many fans, regardless of age, or how long they have been a ""veteran consume"" of Star Wars just feel... exhausted and bored with this main plot that has been carrying on since 1977. Again, not throwing shade at this main story/plot! Just wanting new and refreshing material for upcoming years. I love Star Wars, and want more! Some of us just feel that this large and story rich universe is being amputated, and not allowed to stretch out and see all it has to offer :) Coruscant and Tatooine are cool... but let's spread wider into this beautiful Galaxy that is far far away :)",StarWars,TrueMoose,False,/r/StarWars/comments/ijc9s1/dear_starwars_producers/

79,What happened to Luke's lightsaber between ROTJ and TFA?,1598761390,"Before the Sequel Trilogy, I assumed Luke's lightsaber was destroyed on the Death Star after he tossed it aside. But we see it in flashback in TROS when Luke is training Leia shortly after, and again in TLJ when he contemplates killing his nephew, so we know he actually retrieved it, and kept it for many years after.

However it never appears in the 'present' timeline of the ST. My initial guess would be that Luke discarded it prior to TLJ, given that he had no intention of ever again picking up the mantle of Jedi Knight, and wanted all aspects of the religion to die out. However given that we learn in TROS that he kept Leia's saber for all those years, that seems less likely. At the same time, we can assume he didn't have it on hand given that he didn't give it to Rey for her confrontation with Palpatine. 

So what gives? Has there been any official explanation in canon as to where it went, and if not, do you have any theories? 

It's also a very minor nitpick, but does it not strike anyone else as strange that when Disney decided they were going to hand down one of Luke's lightsabers to Rey, they chose the one that was presumed lost and/or destroyed, raising both the question of where Maz got the blue saber, and what Luke did with the green one?",StarWars,Kerb_Poet,False,/r/StarWars/comments/ij6rk6/what_happened_to_lukes_lightsaber_between_rotj/

0,The most insane thing Obi-Wan has ever said.,1598750053,"""With your kind permission, I should like some fuel, and to use your city as a base as I search nearby systems for General Grievous.""

- Obi-Wan Kenobi, *Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith*

The context is Obi-Wan's solo arrival on Utapau, a planet the Jedi Council had intercepted a Separatist transmission from.

Read this again: ""as I search nearby systems.""

Searching not one, but potentially several systems?

Now, a system is made up of several planets. And Obi-Wan wants to search several *systems*. Which means Obi-Wan intended to search several tens of planets, if we assume ~5 planets per system and ~5 nearby systems.

Obi-Wan is either a genius, or completely crazy.

We can't find people who have been kidnapped within a few square miles even after weeks of hunting parties by hundreds of people, here on Earth. And the surface area of the Earth is ~200,000,000 square miles.

Granted, most of it is water, but Utapau has no seas or oceans. Neither do several other planets in the Star Wars galaxy, like Tatooine, Geonosis, and Coruscant.

If Obi-Wan intends to search 25 planets (assuming 5 planets per system and 5 systems in total), and each planet has the same surface area of the Earth (plausible, the gravity on every planet in the Star Wars galaxy is mysteriously the same), and each planet is 100% land, that's a total of **5 billion square miles** that Obi-Wan will have to search to find General Grievous.

Grievous is not Force sensitive. Hence Obi-Wan can't sense him through the Force. Which means he'll have to proceed with a naked eye search. Of 5 billion square miles.

Searching one square mile of desert is a lot easier than searching one square mile of city. To average this out, and assuming that Obi-Wan has excellent detective skills, let's say he can search one square mile per hour. This enterprise will take him 5 billion hours, which is 570,000 years. Obi-Wan will be dead before having finished searching his first *planet*, nevermind his first *system*.

But, of course, Obi-Wan doesn't have to do this alone. He can bring the troops of the Republic with him, who, we must presume, have advanced reconnaissance technology. We're going to deploy thousands of clones to this mission. So let's cut this search time by a factor of 10,000. Obi-Wan and the clones can now search 10,000 square miles per hour. That's still going to take 57 years. These clones will die long before they're finished. 

If we assume that 50% of the surface areas of the planets Obi-Wan intends to search are water (and assuming Grievous isn't hiding in a Separatist submarine), this will still take him 28.5 years. If they find Grievous halfway through their search, it will still take him 14.25 years.

So Obi-Wan was presumably willing to dedicate the next 15 years looking for Grievous.",StarWars,RoutineProcedure,False,/r/StarWars/comments/ij44e1/the_most_insane_thing_obiwan_has_ever_said/

14,"My thoughts on the "" I have the high ground"" scene so many people have made fun of over the years to the point it has became a long standing meme.",1598746204,"People for decades have I feel have misinterpreted the whole I have the high ground thing and I just sit and watch people make fun of it for ages and never said my thoughts on it. Now I am not saying I'm right, I'm just giving my interpretation of that scene and what I felt Obi Wan meant and what was really going on. 

Well here we go. Obi Wan is not literally meaning he has the high ground thus he is going to win the battle. He also does not mean he has some sort of moral high ground. Obi Wan drew out this fight and was trying to get Anakin to make a mistake to actually off himself so Obi Wan didn't have to kill him, because yes Obi Wan still loves him. You don't stop loving someone that close to you even if they commit a crime. I'd argue you'd love them more and want to help them and being Obi Wan knows how hard of a life Anakin had it made him truly pity him too. 

So what did the high ground comment mean? Well notice how before Anakin does anything Obi Wan says don't try it? That's because Obi Wan has recreated in a way the moment he defeated Darth Maul even though it's not in a pit. Anakin is far below and Obi is above however in a reverse of the situation. It's no doubt a story Anakin had heard from his master a billion times, how he defeated Maul. Obi pulled off a move incredible even for a Jedi and it even surprised Darth Maul it was so impossible to pull off. 

By putting Anakin in that same situation Obi Wan is saying hey now youre where I was all those years ago vs Maul yet you don't have the ability or skill to pull off a move like I did. Which is why Anakin stated ""you underestimate my power"". He was challenging his skill directly and basically saying you can't pull off what I did. 

Obi Wans entire duel of holding off Anakin had a duel purpose though, to let him possibly doom himself and also to make him angry at his lack of ability to kill Obi Wan given his skills and power. Obi Wan knew the move he used to take out Maul took immense concentration and he knew Anakin in his state of rage could never pull it off. Yet with his comment of I had the high ground it was a direct challenge Anakin could not resist. He acted with anger and lost the fight.

There might have been around 6-8 in a group just hanging out front of the theater and they were just let out of what Im thinking was the 7pm showing. The group loved our cosplay and ask to take a picture with us. 

What I'm hoping is that by some random chance that photo is floating out there somewhere. Maybe, either on someones Instagram page or just in a camera roll of someones iPhone. It is unfortunately the only photo my wife and I took that night together in our cosplay, and Im hoping maybe I can track it down. I feel dumb that we never took a picture before hand, but the past is the past.

91,Palpatine cheated the Prophecy,1598721559,"Okay so as we all know Anakin Skywalker is the Chosen One to ultimately bring balance to the Force. However, as we all know Palpatine survived which made some people theorise that Rey was the Chosen One or that the Prophecy was wrong however I have a different theory:

I believe Palpatine was meant to die on the second Death Star. I believe that‚Äôs what the Prophecy alluded to and what was meant to happen to bring peace to the Galaxy. But I think Palpatine had planned for this. I think he knew eventually that he would die or that the Force would try to strike back after his and his masters‚Äô meddling with it. 

As we all know, Palpatine has tried to manipulate the Force before for his own benefits and due to it trying to fight against him it created Anakin Skywalker. So I believe he once again tried to manipulate the Force to change his destiny if the time ever came for him to die. With a combination of the Force and Science to save himself and transfer his essence to another body he had prepared. 

In the original script Kylo Ren said Palpatine was a clone to which Palpatine replied: ‚ÄúMore than a clone, less than a man.‚Äù So it would seem the new body he had prepared for himself was incompatible and the body was slowly degrading.

So I believe Palpatine found a loophole to save himself and cheated destiny however this led to him not being truly in sync with the Force and this meant he could manipulate it to his own measures without having to worry about any prophecies. 

I also like to think that all the Jedi themselves helped to get rid of Palpatine, giving their power to Rey to finally destroy him without the need of destiny.

11,Star Wars content creators. Quantity vs quality. My perspective as a fan and a viewer.,1598714911,"During the pandemic I've taken the time to get back into some interests I've had put aside at some point for one reason or another.

One of those things is Star Wars.  Aside from having seen the Disney released movies in theaters, my interest in it wasn't near the peak of when I was a kid, and oh boy when I was a kid I was all about star wars.  It was one of my top interests until my late teens.

Since the pandemic I've read a few SW books, played through fallen order (Great game) and the single player BF2, watched the season 7 release of TCW and season 1 of The Mandolorian.  These things brought back my passion and interest in SW and reminded me how much I love the world George Lucas built-up.  

After all that, I had a burning desire to look for more SW material and any other SW content.  I've spent the past two months watching tons of YouTube videos on SW and SW related material and reading article after article about this or that.

I'm sure a lot of you, like me, become bored and want something new to watch that's interesting and has substance, even if it's speculation/rumors into the business of Disney, it's employees and the future of SW.  

There's a ton of SW content online. So much so it's almost overwhelming.  But after sifting through years of content. I've realized that most SW content creators choose the quantity over quality route.  Maybe since TROS there hasn't been much to report on besides some gossip here and there and speculation of different shows in production or on their way to.

As a fan, and as someone who thoroughly enjoys absorbing SW content.  It's upsetting to me to have to sift through so much SW click bait.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not mad and I don't find it difficult to just scroll past those content creators videos after I realized all they make is click bait. It upsets me because it feels like a lot of content creators use SW as a tool against fans who are genuinely interested in learning what's going on to gain revenue/views or whatever via YouTube and other platforms because they know putting something like ""Today blah blah blah fired blah blah"" only to have the 10 to 15 minute video contain 10 to 15 seconds of that topic while also having 4 to 5 advertisements. 

I am genuinely interested in anything SW related but, I feel deceived when I go to learn something new, whether it be Lore or actual news. Only to find the the video advertised to be about x, y or z are about none of those things.  

I'm curious to know if anyone else feels like SW content, specifically on YouTube is over saturated with nonsense ""news"" videos.  Being that there are so many SW content creators out there, who do you trust/enjoy to give you SW news and content that has substance and feels genuine and who do you avoid?",StarWars,pastanospoon,False,/r/StarWars/comments/iiua0d/star_wars_content_creators_quantity_vs_quality_my/

It didn't work, and Kathleen saw the result, but her rotten brain ignored. She stole the credid for ""the Mandalorian"" only to be loved by fans, because ""the Mandalorian"" was a success, but failed. She doesn't understand, that there already were plenty of women in Star Wars: princess Leia; the resistance leader (sorry, forgot her name), Luke was obly a pilot; the beloved Ahsoka Tano; Aayla Secura; Luminara Unduli; Padm√© Amidala; Barris Offi; etc... But there is one way to stop the tyranny of Kathleen Kennedy! A woman should complain about it! On youtube, twitch, reddit, twitter, facebook, that doesn't matter. Everybody should view/like/upvote a video/textpost of her complaining about this issue of Star Wars, so Kathleen will see, how many people agree with her. She will no more think that men are sexist, because a woman, complaining about the same issue in Star Wars, can't be sexist at that point.

Ol' Palps had a plan. As far back as the prequels, he was researching cloning technology to fill his stormtrooper ranks AND develop technology to create his own clone bodies. He was building Republic star destroyers which would become the Imperial fleet AND bear the superweapons he created for his Final Order project (dumb name btw, but I digress). There's a clear line in technogical progression from the Death Star I, to Death Star 2, to Starkiller Base, to even the First Order dreadnaught designed to mount enormous cannons on the underside. Now there's a great reason for building a second and ""third"" Death Star: he still needed to perfect the superlaser (which he did, while giving it a sporty red look). No matter that they both got destroyed so quickly, he still got to test them. Hell, creating Snoke was probably part of the process of perfecting his clone bodies, and seems like a great way to keep from putting his dodecagenarian ass on the line while he did it. His return makes sense from a lore standpoint, and I kinda like having a central villain through all 9 movies.

Why do I hate how they did it? Because they shouldn't have waiting until the last fucking movie to actually do it. It's clear that Disney didn't have a coherent overarching plan when creating the Sequel trilogy, and instead of a clever writing choice, our favorite nursing home psychopath coming back to life comes off as a rushed choice meant to tie a very loose bow over a disjointed wooden raft of a storyline. Maybe introduce him towards the end of Episode 8 as an unstoppable force of darkness like Vader was in Rogue One. That would've been an awesome scene.

89,Who I think Snoke was and his intentions.,1598650795,"&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uo8qd6bzbtj51.jpg?width=2292&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d0b96a8d07c5927b9733e0d120163237cb872e5b

This is who I think Snoke was based on what I‚Äôve read and seen. He was a person who had witnessed the rise and fall of the empire from his home world of Exegol. He‚Äôs Palpatine‚Äôs ‚ÄúFrankenstein‚Äù in the sense that he was made using cloning and Sith alchemy. The multiple copies of his body hint towards the possibility that his ‚Äúessence‚Äù, like Palpatine‚Äôs, was possibly transferred between clone bodies. He could have been an early ‚Äútest subject‚Äù in regards to the ‚Äúessence transfer‚Äù and cloning Palpatine and the Sith Eternal were trying to master. 

In regards to the story - Palpatine and the Sith Eternal gave him the reigns to the military machine that is the First Order with three main objectives: 1. to seduce Ben Solo to the dark side so that Palpatine would have the perfect vessel to transfer into; 2. to destroy Luke Skywalker, the last hope of the Jedi and 3. To instill fear in the Galaxy with the First Order as a first ""push"" before the final order began.

However as we all know, dark siders/Sith have a knack of disobeying their masters and seek power for themselves and that's what I think Snoke was doing.

He was a neo-Sith in charge of a neo-Empire who was clearly influenced by the Empire of old ‚Äì with his red-clad Praetorian Guards and obsession with Vader (he does wear a ring encrusted with obsidian obtained from beneath Fortress Vader on Mustafar).  

Snoke was possibly even trained by Palpatine and saw an opportunity to seize power for himself which is why he wanted Rey dead in TLJ - he probably knew she was a Palpatine and didn't want Palpatine regaining power. He knew about the dyad/bond in Ben and Rey and was hoping he could continue his rule as Supreme Leader with Ben Solo as his rabid dog apprentice ‚Äì reminiscent of the glory days of the Empire with Palpatine who had Vader on a leash.  

Of course, his plan didn‚Äôt work out, but he got very close. Snoke probably despised Palptine and was jealous of the former Sith Lord. We‚Äôve seen other Sith apprentices try to recruit and seize power for themselves (like Dooku), so this is very possible. He took what teachings/information Palpatine gave him before departing Exegol and used it to his advantage.

On the other side of the coin - Palpatine didn‚Äôt trust Snoke either which is proven by his manipulation of Snoke's voice in Ben's mind, making Ben hate Snoke that much more. For example: one day Snoke is training Ben and then that night when Ben is alone, Palpatine pretends to be Snoke in Ben's mind and berates the boy even further - because remember - Palpatine wants Ben to kill Snoke, proving that he can be a worthy heir to the Sith. That‚Äôs one of the main differences with Palpatine in the ST as compared to the OT, is that he‚Äôs in the shadows even more so and is willing to let the apprentice kill the master which he has seen play in his previous life when Vader killed him. 

To sum it up: Snoke was used as a ""stand-in emperor"" by Palpatine to get the Galaxy ready for his eventual return. Snoke was definitely his own person as we can see he has a different personality than Palpatine in TLJ ‚Äì Palpatine is calm and confident where as Snoke can have angry outbursts. Snoke is one of my favorite characters to come out of the ST because of the mystery that surrounds him and Andy Serkis' amazing performance.",StarWars,skywalkinondeezhatrz,False,/r/StarWars/comments/iig662/who_i_think_snoke_was_and_his_intentions/

12,"The Battle of Utupau, 34 A.B.Y",1598644764,"Just wanted to splurge my ideas on a major Sequel battle in my headcanon as I‚Äôve attempted to flesh it out. This will be presented as some kind of overview looking back at the battle, not a retelling of it.

Utupau was the farthest the New Republic formally extended towards Hutt space, and was thus, home to the 9th NR fleet, assigned to primarily anti-pirating operations, based on the flagship *Shakalia* Admiral Nimizia oversaw the fleet, comprised of two MC-95s, an MC-85, and 31 various smaller vessels including the *Exemplarance* veteran of the Galactic Civil war. despite its outdated nature, 9th fleet was still one of the largest battle groups possessed by the New Republic. 

Utupau had grown into a fairly industrious planet and sported small shipyards producing various freighters and support craft for the New Republic, as well as housing a significant research center. It was these capabilities that made it a prime target for a First Order invasion.

The First Order 15th battlegroup, based around the battlecruiser *Constrictor* was tasked with assaulting and eliminating the New Republic at Utupau. The Battlegroup comprised of 4 resurgent class battlecruisers, 4 diligent class corvettes, 6 light cruisers, and the Nebulon K frigate *Starboard‚Äôs wrath*. The light cruisers had been pulled from the 5th bombardment group, which had been split to reinforce the attack at Naboo.

Approximately 15 galactic minutes after the Hosnian cataclysm, and right in the middle of a frenzied intelligence briefing, the First Order ships entered the Utupau system, just outside of effective firing range, and launched what could only be described as a hailstorm of fighters. Admiral Nimizia immediately ordered the engagement of crystal wing, comprising the bulk of 9th fleet‚Äôs fighter escort. Jade, Diamond, Ruby, Amethyst, Saphire, and Emerald squadron moved into defensive position as approximately 400 First Order fighters approached. 

As the 16th battlegroup moves into firing range, they quickly picked off 5 smaller  New Republic ships and freighters, as they attempted to scurry under the protection of the Mon Calamari shield arrays. As the New Republic battle line tightened around he orbital stations and shipyards of Utupau, the First order deployed all their light cruisers and transports, under the escort of the *Starboard‚Äôs wrath* to attempt and make a run on the planet itself.

As both navies clashed in The initial engagement, New Republic fighters found themselves quickly outmatched and forced to fall back to the cover of the escort ships, Saphire and Diamond squadron failed to return and were obliterated. First Order fighter and bomber forces suffered a similar fate however, when attempting to make a run on the *Sawremption* the only other MC-95 in the fleet.

As both sides fell back to kick their wounds, Nimizia realized The First Order had almost reached the surface. In a desperate bid, she deployed all New Republic ground forces to the planet, and to cover for them, ordered Jade and Emerald squadron, to conduct a suicide run on the *Starboard‚Äôs wrath* in order to allow the troops to reach the surface. Outnumbered 3 to 1, Jade and Emerald squadron plunged into the landing group and scored hit after hit on the First Order ship, each time having their numbers shaved off. As the *Starboard‚Äôs wrath* entered firing range of the transports, Jade 9 led a last ditch attack on the cruiser and scored a lucky hit on the engine reactors that made the ship dead in the water, as Jade and Emerald squadron broke off the attack, They watched the fireworks and somberly reflected on their near 50% causality rate.

Thanks to their heroic efforts however, the First Order landing force was unable to advance, and had to instead, dig in and prepare for an elongated siege. For another 2 days, both sides occasionally engaged, firing salvoes and blaster bolts, cannons and missiles, only to pull back once again, bit by bit, the First Order was chipping away at the 9th fleet, but they themselves were running low on fighter reserves and escort ships. 

Displeased with the lack of progress in the battle, from his station on the Finalizer, Hux ordered the reallocation of the 5th Bombardment group to Utupau, he would not have the Republic defy him. As the 4th day of battle raged on, in the sky, and on the ground, the 9th fleet was getting antsy, Nimizia had relocated Jade and Emerald to a station aboard the *Pragmattus* , behind the battle lines, the 9th was down to sub 100 fighters and 19 supplementary ships, even still, Nimizia had hope, that reinforcements would arrive, and perhaps even the Resistance would arrive to assist. It was not to be. 

Arriving in system, the *Municiator* and her escorts immediately targeted the *Sawremption* and in the fraction of a second, the tide of battle had turned. The Mandator‚Äôs cannons ripped through the massive mon cal ship and tore it assunder, leaving a gaping hole in the 9th fleet‚Äôs battleline.

Immediately reacting, Nimizia desperately ordered the *Pragmattus* and surrounding ships to evacuate and carry as many Utupauns as they could, Jade and Emerald squadron made desperate,fast trips to the planet surface to evacuate as many people as they could, smaller ships and freighter being torn apart around them. The First Order moves in for the kill while the Mandator stayed far behind, safe from any last ditch attacks.

As the fleet carried out her Orders, Nimizia moved to the main bridge of the *Shakalia* and piloted The massive warship to put The fleeing *Pragmattus* in her shadow, and took the full brunt of 4 Resurgent broadsides to ensure as much time as possible to the evacuation. As More and More First Order Forces made it to the ground. And more and more of her ships went down around her, Nimizia ordered the Pragmattus to leave, and as the last of Jade squadron docked with the MC-85 and disappeared into hyperspace, Nimizia watched with the same sense of hope she‚Äôd always carried, and sighed in resignation, as the *Shakalia* burst into flames, hit by round after round from the *Municiator*.

Utupau would fall a day later, it‚Äôs cities and facilities burning craters, and it‚Äôs people, save for those evacuated aboard what remained of the 9th, wiped from the face of the Galaxy.

The soundtrack!!!! I‚Äôm sorry but the prequels have the best soundtrack followed by the original trilogy and then the sequels. I feel they pulled off the soundtrack better than most movies I‚Äôve ever seen!

Storyline. I also felt the storyline of the prequels was much easier to follow and overall better than the other trilogies. Obv it‚Äôs not perfect and had many flaws but portrayed the best imo

The sequels lack of cohesion is in my opinion the result of the star wars fanbase shitting on the movies in general too hard. We get The Force Awakens because of how bad the sequels were and Disney trying to get away from it. Everyone complains it is too similar to the OT, so Disney brings in Rian Johnson to subvert our expectations and give us something completely different. The Last Jedi divides the community, so they bring back JJ to create an oddly stitched together movie riddled with fan service through and through for a last minute effort to appease the fans.


If the prequels had come out during the time of the internet being as large as it is now, would it have shared the same fate?

Feel free to post spoilers and lay it all out. I am in no way looking for plot holes, I'm just trying to wrap my head around what is going on with this movie before I start watching. With that being said...*

I paused the opening text crawl trying to sort it out in my mind before I could even start playing the movie, and I'm still not sure it makes any sense to me. In fact, I'm sure it doesn't.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Turmoil has engulfed the Galactic Republic. The taxation of trade routes to outlying star systems is in dispute. 

From this I gather that all of the (willingly participatory) galaxies are joined together in a republic, which by its nature would meet in a senatorial fashion--members of which are elected by their sending star systems. Presumably the seat of governmental power is near some sort of universal hub, and the referenced ""outlying star systems"" are difficult/dangerous to get to, so goods cost more for them, due to a tax being levied. They're disputing the fairness of this, as they are part of a supposedly equal-rights republic. Pretty bad ass, and honestly, I side with the outlying districts on this. So far, so good.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Hoping to resolve the matter with a **blockade of deadly battleships**, the greedy Trade **Federation** has stopped all shipping to the small planet of Naboo.  

Wait... what? Without digging into political minutia, how is there another layer to galactic trade, whereby the (presumably) largest figures in the industry can band together and form an extra-governmental federation of their own, with the sole purpose of dictating (with force!) trade between star systems?? This would seem to completely invalidate the purpose of the Galactic Republic and render it illegitimate by the very nature of its existence, as a republic is formed for essentially 2 functions: tax-free interstate commerce, and joint defense. At best, it's a competing government. At worst, this would be akin to Walmart setting up armed militia at the entry points to Alaska. Either way, it's clearly the role of the Republic to step in.

From here the 2 Jedi board one of those battleships, on which one of the aliens state (paraphrasing)

&gt;Yes, come aboard, everything we're doing is perfectly legal.

At this point, I shut the movie off until I could write this post and ask this question. In no way am I saying I don't like the movie, I am just the type that needs to understand what's happening to enjoy the story. And if the point is that I'm supposed to *not* understand it yet because it will come out in the wash later--that is also fine.

87,Sims 4 DLC Gamepack -Will Journey to Batuu be a Canon Storyline?,1598624805,"So this may be off the radar for most of this subreddit, but The Sims announced their next DLC was a Star Wars themed game pack which usually comes with a story line. 

To add context, they did a stranger things style game pack without having rights to the brand so called it Strangerville and had you work through a series of goals to defeat their version of the mind flair. 

The part that makes Star Wars more concerning to me, aside from liking the sims and worrying about impact to gameplay, Star Wars is obviously big on what‚Äôs canon and what isn‚Äôt since Disney took over and wanted to blur some lines especially. Does anyone here worry that since this is Star Wars brand and they have rights that this will be a canon story line? If yes, I feel like beyond EA‚Äôs normal cash grab, this is seeking making Star Wars fans purchase the base game and pack ($60 total unless the price changes on the GP which was done with previous sims titles for celebrity packs) if they want to experience the new addition to the story line. 

The story line does include Rey and Kylo Ren and one of the objectives revealed by the product page reveals one goal is to meet them.

17,Star wars is so much more than the movies,1598611788,"If you would have asked me a year ago what seat wars was I would have told you a cool action movie with flowy swords.

In the last year though, I have watched the clone wars, rebels, played the video games and read at least 12 books.

I can now say star wars is so much more.

It's the pride and complacency of the jedi and their rigid belief to an outdated system.
It's the scourge of war and the price both sides pay.
It's the delusional blasphemy of those too proud to take responsibility. 
It's the bond between a master and their apprentice.
It's the elegance of the jedi and with alike
It's the fall of order and the rise of chaos
It's the bond of a father and son.
It's so much more

When you're playing against another decent player, 90% of your kit is useless. Katas, jumping attacks, most of your directional attacks etc. do nothing but look flashy and leave you open. Everyone uses single saber, strong style and just sort of runs in figure 8's doing the same default horizontal slash until someone gets clipped in the side and dies instantly.

In the show, we got to see more clones, we got to see their life, how the Jedi loved them more than anything, and how they trusted them. Especially with Ahsoka and the 332nd. They had armor to match hers, they were under her command. She cared for them. To see them betray her like that sparked more emotion than any other moment in the show. Even after they had died, after they had tried to kill her, she honored them by making graves for every clone that died on that ship.

To me it seems like 1-6 was the Skywalker saga as it told the story of Anakin from rise to fall and redemption. That was the Skywalker story. 

Luke as central as he was to the OT, in the big picture, just served to tell Anakin's story by showing that hope, love and compassion is a force for change. And the sequels didn't really advance his character much IMO. He took an Anakin like arc by falling and then death bed redemption. It seemed more like a way to close the character off rather than the central focus of the latest trilogy.

7-9 seem as much a Solo (Kylo) story as Skywalker if not more. So I guess I don't understand how 1-9 is viewed as the Skywalker saga.",StarWars,redvan1983,False,/r/StarWars/comments/ii2fk5/why_is_it_called_the_skywalker_saga/

You can have your own custom ship and and lightsaber and if you earn enough credits maybe a pet too. You can explore everything from the dephs of kamino to the lava planet mustafar. The edge of the map would be the unknown regions where you would be killed by something like a meteor. This would also be a good spot to put some easter eggs in. You can talk with npcs and most places are explorable. You can have houses and apartments on most of the planets. Both flora and fuana can be hostile and dangerous. Unlike fallen order there is a system where you can lose limbs. Npcs are obviously killable but you can get the police on you if your on a city planet or bounty hunters if your on a planet lile tatooine. I just think it would be a good idea though it would take a long time to make. I think it would be a game where you can just have fun with your friends or meet new ones in a full open world star wars game.

I think the acting was terrible but the story was decent 
Attack of the Clones
This movie was ok at best. I feel that the romance between Anakin and Padm√© was a bit corny.
The Clone Wars TV Show and Movie
Really great show and the movie was also pretty good. 
Revenge of the Sith
Great movie except for the killing younglings part.
Solo
This movie sucked. Han Solo was originally protrayed as never loving anyone until he met Luke and Leia. This movie raises more questions than answers and ruins Han as a character
Rebels TV show
Corny and anticlimactic. Ends the story of Darth Maul in a sad, boring way.
Rogue One
Amazing movie. The only thing Disney did right except for the Mandalorian.
A New Hope
A classic. A great movie with good storytelling and stellar plot.
The Empire Strikes Back
The best movie. Includes the biggest plot twist in all of Star Wars.
Return of the Jedi
The worst of the original trilogy but still a great end to the galctic civil war.
The Mandalorian 
So far only season 1 is out and it is such a great show. By far the best thing Disney has done with the franchise.
Star wars resistance TV show
Only watched the 1st episode and hated it. So corny.
The Force Awakens
A sad reboot and knock off a New Hope. As George Lukas once said ""JJ Abrams can kiss my a**.""
The Last Jedi
A low speed police chase. If I wanted this I would watch some 1970s cop shows. Corny romance and bad plot.
Rise of Skywalker

Really think about it, the Republic bought them and pays to have more created, they are indoctrinated into loyalty to the current regime right down to their DNA, if they do manage to decide they don't want to fight they are tried and punished as traitors. There's no plan for any kind of ""retirement"" or opportunity outside of serving. Worst of all, they believe they are fighting for freedom and peace that they will never be a part of.

Anakin and the Republic have no right to be so judgemental of slavers. They at least take slaves and are honest about it instead of creating thinking feelings being to be thrown into war.

60,"Wedge Antilies being a member of Rogue Squadron after Hoth, and it existing after Hoth, has been recanonized",1598564314,"So I'm a huge Legends fan. To me its still what happened after ROTJ. And one of the big parts of Legends is Rogue Squadron. I grew up playing the games. In fact my first game for the N64 was the Rogue Squadron game. I read the novels cover to cover multiple times. The comics were some of the first comics I ever bought. Wedge and his connection to the Rogues was about as important to me as Luke's connection to the New Jedi Order when it comes to Star Wars.

So when the NEU happened and Aftermath came out I and many others were kind of sad because Wedge wasn't with the Rogues. He was with some other group, and in fact the Rogues are never mentioned. Then we learn that the Rogues aren't credited at being at Yavin in the NEU nor were they mentioned at all after Hoth. Even the main comic doesn't even get around to naming Red Squadron Rogue Squadron untill a few months before ESB.

So I and many others were sad. It didn't seem like the Rogues were around for that long or that even if they were somehow around after Hoth Wedge wasn't with them.

But then Squadrons, which is between Endor and Aftermath has Wedge go and introduce himself as a member of Rogue Squadron. Not a former member, not a member of the squadron he is in in Aftermath. But as a pilot in Rogue Squadron.

So now I and all the other Rogue Squadron and Wedge fans can be happy that the Rogues existing post hoth and Yavin and Wedge being a part of them has been recanonized. I mean he still ends up being given the option of a court marshall or teaching at a flight academy (Which could make really good stories and I hope they explore that in the future) so their won't be any long running post RotJ Rogue Squadron series like in Legends. But we can still have those kinds of stories pre Endor now.

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

There was a working man, in the senate long ago

He was big and cruel and had lightning on the go

The Jedi looked at him with anger and with fear

But to Anakin he had amazing atmosphere

He could preach the Dark Side so Ani can reach her

And his teachings he admired

But he also was the kind of teacher

A new apprentise he desired

Pa Pa Palpatine

Met a kid from Tatooine

He worked hard so the Jedi were gone

Pa Pa Palpatine

Turned a man into machine

It was a shame how he carried on

He ruled the Galaxy, planets near planets far

He wanted to blow them up with a death star

In all affairs of Senate he was the man to please

He trained a man whose throats he liked to squeeze

So the boy was a mad killer

And he heard about the things he done

He told him that he could heal her

To save his daughter and son

Pa Pa Palpatine

Met a kid from Tatooine

He worked hard so the Jedi were gone

Pa Pa Palpatine

Turned a man into machine

It was a shame how he carried on

But when his empire and army
And his hunger for power
Became known to more and more people
The demands to do something
About this outrageous man
Became louder and louder

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

""This mans got to go"" said the Jedi on the scene

But Anikan begged ""don't you try do do it please""

No doubt this palpatine had lot lot of hidden charms

85,My favorite thing about the entire Squadrons trailer is two simple words- Rogue Squadron,1598558563,"So yes the trailer was awesome. The first full minuite was like a really cool propaganda video. We got to see interesting missions, full on cap ship battles, the Starhawks main weapon, and even a XG-1 space station along with Hera and Sloane. But for me the higlight of the video is at the 1:30 mark where Wedge Antilies intoduces himself as a member of Rogue Squadron.

So I'm a huge Legends fan. To me its still what happened after ROTJ. And one of the big parts of Legends is Rogue Squadron. I grew up playing the games. In fact my first game for the N64 was the Rogue Squadron game. I read the novels cover to cover multiple times. The comics were some of the first comics I ever bought. Wedge and his connection to the Rogues was about as important to me as Luke's connection to the New Jedi Order when it comes to Star Wars.

So when the NEU happened and Aftermath came out I and many others were kind of sad because Wedge wasn't with the Rogues. He was with some other group, and in fact the Rogues are never mentioned. Then we learn that the Rogues aren't credited at being at Yavin in the NEU nor were they mentioned at all after Hoth. Even the main comic doesn't even get around to naming Red Squadron Rogue Squadron untill a few months before ESB.

So I and many others were sad. It didn't seem like the Rogues were around for that long or that even if they were somehow around after Hoth Wedge wasn't with them.

But then Squadrons, which is between Endor and Aftermath has Wedge go and introduce himself as a member of Rogue Squadron. Not a former member, not a member of the squadron he is in in Aftermath. But as a pilot in Rogue Squadron.

So now I and all the other Rogue Squadron and Wedge fans can be happy that the Rogues existing post hoth and Yavin and Wedge being a part of them has been recanonized. I mean he still ends up being given the option of a court marshall or teaching at a flight academy (Which could make really good stories and I hope they explore that in the future) so their won't be any long running post RotJ Rogue Squadron series like in Legends. But we can still have those kinds of stories pre Endor now.

So thank you Squadrons Dev's.",StarWars,TheMastersSkywalker,False,/r/StarWars/comments/ihsdzf/my_favorite_thing_about_the_entire_squadrons/

Even to the Republic, Empire, and Rebel Alliance, they too are their enemies in their own eyes due to being corrupted by the Jedi first then the Sith. Same goes for the Mandalorians for their ways of warmongering to prolong their culture.

If they were to operate as a whole, I wonder where and who will put them under the protection.

3,How I would have made the sequels (my fan fiction). Thanks for reading :),1598522795,"Keep in mind I've never read any of the books, but know of the Thrawn series. this is generally how I'd establish each of the films written in as *concise* a way as I could. Plenty of stuff missed, but this is how I'd generally have made the films. Let me know your thoughts:

**Episode 7**: Luke has created a new Jedi temple and is training a new generation of Jedi including Ben Solo and Rey (who isn't a skywalker). The start of the film establishes that young Ben is capable of falling to the dark side due to his frustrations with not being as powerful as the other padawans despite being Luke's nephew. Rey is introduced as an incredibly powerful padawan who clearly is in love with Ben. In other parts of the galaxy, we learn that what remains of the empire is being slowly brought back together by Admiral Thrawn (the main bad guy of my trilogy). A series of battles ensues and other characters are introduced. Poe is introduced as a top gun pilot during an invasion by Admiral Thrawn of the homeworld where Luke's new Jedi temple is.  His piloting skills help protect the Jedi temple. Finn is introduced as a storm trooper that turns after being convinced by someone who asks, ""do you really want to be fighting for the guys who end up losing?"" This would explain why he turns on his own team after he realizes how many loses the Empire has suffered while also offering a sort of moral dilemma within Finn. Ben Solo turns to the dark side later after encountering Grand Admiral Thrawn who claims to have the ability to make Ben as powerful as the emperor if they join forces. Ben goes back to the temple thinking he is already strong enough to defeat the Jedi and gets into a lightsaber battle with a Jedi character we met earlier in the movie. He nearly loses before being saved by Thrawn's team who quickly get Ben to safety. Luke is distraught at the thought of his nephew turning to the dark side, as is Rey who we've learned had feelings for Ben. It is established that Thrawn and Ben will continue to grow stronger, and something most be done to counter their efforts. 

**Episode 8**: Ben and Thrawn have managed to create a sizable force from the scraps of the Empire. Although they're still out gunned, they've managed to take control of several planets and their forces have increased in size. A space battle takes place with Poe, Leia and Admiral Ackbar doing their best to fight Thrawn's forces. Leia is killed during this battle and Thrawn's might is shown in full force. Ben communicates with Rey through the force in an effort to convince her to join them. He says that he can provide her with all the answers she's ever wanted, including where she came from, who her parents were, and additional secrets to the force. All she has to do is go to Korriban and meet him there. Luke senses a disturbance in Rey and confronts her on it before she lashes out at Luke for taking her from her homeworld and away from her family. Luke seems distressed at the thought of losing another padawan and tries to convince her that's not what happened. Rey flies to Korriban where she meets her love interest, Ben. She's informed by Ben that the planet they are on has many secrets that have the power to increase their abilities 10 fold and will enable them to take out Luke and rule the galaxy. Reluctantly, Rey enters one of the tombs where she hears the voice of Palpetine who talks about the dark side as well as who her family is. Palpetine lies and says she is his granddaughter, and that Luke murdered her parents. She opens a case to find Palpetine's lightsaber. She turns to her love interest Ben who says, ""join me."" She touches the lightsaber and ignites it as she too turns to the dark side with glowing red around her from the lightsaber blade.

**Episode 9**: Ben, Thrawn, and Rey have grown even more powerful. Poe and Admiral Ackbar do a good job holding off Thrawn's forces, but Thrawn has proven himself to be a strong opponent. Luke acknowledges the growing strength of the new imperial fleet and goes on a quest to find those who helped him in the past. He finds Lando, Chewie and of course Han who has a few cheeky remarks about his son turning to the darkside. ""I thought I left him in good hands..."" he tells Luke as he's frustrated to learn that his son has turned to the darkside under Luke's care. Han also learns that Leia is dead causing Han to become visibly upset and frustrated. Luke pulls together a team of pilots and the old cast for one final battle. The only way they'll win is by destroying Thrawn and redeeming Ben and Rey. They come up with a plan to board Thrawn's ship with a small group of forces while Han, Chewie, Lando, and Poe all give us the coolest space fight we've ever seen. Luke, Finn, and Jannah all board Thrawn's flagship via a tiny ship of their own. Finn and Jannah are tasked with setting a device to blow up the ship, and ultimately we're met with an epic fight between Luke and Rey. Luke defeats Rey by cutting Palpetine's lightsaber in half and telling Rey she's been lied to in order to turn her to the dark side. Luke let's Rey know the truth about her past and how her parents didn't want her, but that's okay because she's still wanted by the Jedi temple. Rey believes Luke, and takes him to Ben who is on the viewing platform with Thrawn watching the space battle. Finn and Jannah are shown moving through the ship to setup the device that will cause the flagship to explode. Luke and Rey find Ben who battles Luke while Rey and Thrawn watch and shout at Ben (similar to the devil and angel on your shoulder trope). Luke wins after cutting Ben's hand off. Luke and Rey comfort Ben and let him know that he can still be redeemed. Ben doesn't believe them thinking he's done too many horrible things, but in the presence of the girl he loves he agrees to be taken back to the Jedi temple with Rey. Thrawn, visibly upset, runs into an escape hatch leading to his tie fighter. Luke and Rey pick Ben up and take him to their ship where Finn and Jannah have been waiting. Thrawn gets into an epic dog fight with our heroes in space (Han, Poe, etc) before being shot down by Poe. As our heroes all fly away, Thrawn's flagship explodes thanks to Finn and Jannah. The end scene shows all of our heroes being awarded for their bravery by Luke at his Jedi temple who leaves us with some final words, ""although evil may still exist in this galaxy, we will always stand *united* against it."" \[Credits\]",StarWars,GODZILLA-19,False,/r/StarWars/comments/ihicxc/how_i_would_have_made_the_sequels_my_fan_fiction/

9,Watching The Last Jedi with Fresh Eyes,1598517917,"I recently watched the last Jedi for the second time. I hadnt seen it since my original viewing in the theater. I originally hated it, felt like it was character assasination for luke and didnt feel like Star Wars at all and overall had a strong negative reaction to it. Ive come to the conclusion that that's because i had so much built up anticipation for what i wanted it to be, and when it wasn't that at all i felt cheated. With new eyes far removed from the priginal expectation it is not as bad as i once believed, and for me has some of the highest highs (and lowest lows) in all the Star wars sequels.

Highest highs

Luke's storyline- I actually now like where they went with Luke, he is after all human and none of us are frozen in our beliefs and attitudes at 25. Life has a way of breaking us down and making us culynical as we age so the fact this hapoens to Luke too is very believable and relatable. The fact that he has to find his way back to the light, making luke have a complete character ark from cynical defeated old man to a hopeful version of his old self is a nice thing to see. 

Yoda- Dropping wisdom like wamp rats. Frank oz coming back and fully capturing Empire strikes back Yoda. His beautiful wisdom about growing and learning from failure, all of that genuinely brought a tear to my eye. Great stuff

Everything with Kylo- pretty self explanatory. Adam Driver kills it as Kylo.

Throne room scene- epic

Luke's speech and showdown at the end

The lowest of lows

Everything with Holdo- Wholly moly over the top feminism bomb batman! Star wars women were strong because they needed to be not because they were trying to send a message to boys to ""shut up and follow blind orders fly boy"" It was all so so over done. Should have been ackbar in command and to make the sacrifice.

Subverting for subversion sake- it's one thing to subvert expectation, it's another to see how mang times you can do it in a movie just to mess with the audience. The subversion almost subverted itself by becoming predictable. Metta bro

Cantobyte to nowhere- That whole sequence seemed to serve only to bring this unnecessary character into the fold (rose) and build her relationshio with Finn only for it to be unrequited and go nowhere. Lets just delete Rose completely, and delete that whole side plot. We are already having a hard enough time balancing new characters and old, no need to throw even more in there.

Luke dying- I feel like it would have been more powerful and bad ass if he had actually been there for the fight and dued the way ben died if yiu wanted to kill him off. 

Anyway. On 2nd researching of the last jedi i think we were all a little harder on it than we needed to be.

In the new canon, we know that Snoke took an early interest in Ben Solo and is responsible for his corruption. We also know that Snoke was literally created by Palpatine, with the set pieces in Rise of Skywalker alluding to the fact that he may be some kind of force using clone.

64,The New Trilogy Should've Started At Episode X And Here Are Some Rough Ideas [SPOILERS FOR THE ENTIRE SAGA],1598493178,"70 Years After RtoJ The galaxy is divided between 3 main factions. 

&amp;#x200B;

The New Republic controls the Inner-Rim and Core Systems. The Neutral Systems, Republic Allies and Dominion Allies reside in the Mid-Rim acting as a buffer for the Imperial Dominion, the successor state created by Thrawn who now lives his final moments. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Force has awakened and Force Users are being born at unprecedented rates, Lukes New Jedi Order failed to curtail the explosion of new philosophies and ideas regarding the Force and disbanded, aiming instead to cultivate and guide the New Force. The Sith and Jedi Orthodoxy have been pushed to the fringes of the New Force Society with Sith Orthodoxy being very illegal and outlawed and Jedi Orthodoxy being so lame no one practises it. (some people practise it but I won't detail them here)

(Yes, force users can have a social life out of their cult, no blue balls for them)

&amp;#x200B;

The true descendants of Lukes Jedi, The Paladins are galactic peacekeepers, not aligned with any faction but instead abide by the Nubian Accords which detail the situations the Paladins can intervene, primarily in the Interest of Sentient Rights. The Paladins are led by Anakin Skywalker, son of Luke Skywalker who holds absolute power within the Paladins.

&amp;#x200B;

With Thrawn diminishing, the extremist factions of the Dominion fight for power, New Republic War Hawks are jockeying the senate and aligned systems to take a stand against the Dominion both powers are recruiting Force Users and developing new death star technology. The Paladins are helpless to stop the recruitment of Force users as no law in galaxy prohibits force users from voluntarily joining the military. An Issue Luke Skywalker fought until his death.

&amp;#x200B;

Leia Organa Solo after the Civil-War could not accept the Dominion's place as a government resigned from the New Republic Government, creating a Resistance that, after her death became increasingly ruthless and militant. Han Solo, remained a part of the New Republic as it's Minister of War and founded the highly respected Falcon Legion which now acts as the Governments Military Police and Coruscant peace-keepers. Han Solo died a decorated hero of the Galaxy maybe a few decades ago, I don't know. 

&amp;#x200B;

(If you hadn't noticed i am shamelessly stealing from a lot of Starwars rewrites by Youtubers, please don't sue me)

&amp;#x200B;

Ben Skywalker, great-grandson of Han and Leia Organa Solo at like 18-19 is gonna be promoted from Padawan to Knight but Anakin Juinor is bid suspicious because Ben's parents or one of them were true sith, whichever sith parent crashed on Tattooine and was horribly crippled and Ben lived on Tattoine for like 12-15 years until he was picked up by some roaming Paladin and brought to Tython. yep, using Tython. 

Ben Skywalker is also depressingly average in the force, give him a chip on his shoulder but he's an awesome pilot. Due to his lightsaber being a beacon for bounty hunters Paladins he sticks to a blaster most of the time. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ben gets framed for his Master's murder, why or how I don't know but Ben is now on the run and hides at Tattoine where he meets Rey in the same vein as Finn. 

&amp;#x200B;

Rey is similar to her self in the movies, naturally strong in the force but she lives on Tattootine so she's kinda a bitch and very ruthless. She guides ben through the Jundland wastes for money and a promise of a ship off the planet. They bond because of Tattooine slave culture and other Tattooine related stuff

&amp;#x200B;

We meet Finn (FN-2187), whose a Dominion Storm Trooper who doing ""recon"" on Tattooine as punishment for insubordination, Finn believes in the Dominion and doesn't know that Storm-Troopers are stolen from birth. Finn used to have a squad, his squad is reassigned to someplace else. 

&amp;#x200B;

Our trio converges when, The Knights of Ren, one of the Sith Orthodoxy groups corners Ben and Rey, Finn investigates because it's his job. A fight happens and Kylo Ren, yep I'm keeping him, leads the charge. 

&amp;#x200B;

Kylo is unbeknownst to the remaining Skywalkers the *other* remaining Organa-Solo descendent, I don't have a real name for him but suffice to say, Kylo has been very indoctrinated. The Knights of Ren work for a member of the Dominion High Council. Finn does not know that and unwittingly commits treason when he interferes for just long enough for Ben and Rey to escape. 

&amp;#x200B;

(Where they go, I don't know he's probably chasing down whoever framed him while Rey just wants to be deposited on an inner-rim planet).

&amp;#x200B;

It's basically if like regular private screws up a black-ops operation, but seeing Finn's obvious martial prowess as he a non-force-user did not die when interfering, Kylo requests Finn's punishment be lifted and Finn and his old squad are now an attache for the Knights of Ren.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd call Episode X The Kyber Campaign or Mandalore's War because suddenly I'm feeling the Mandalorians want to conquer the Neutral and Aligned Systems and it's basically a massive conspiracy and race to acquire more Kyber for more mini deathstars. I have not figured anything out, this is just a starting point for me or anyone else that feels like they can do a lot more with this idea than I can.

&amp;#x200B;

Other Thoughts. Clones were popular for a time, so there a bunch of clones running around, as I'm typing this I realise the Mandalorians could be the Clones and their vengeance for being used as weapons of war.

99,How does turning to the Dark Side work?,1598485641,"We know what leads to the dark side: pain, suffering, fear, anger, jealousy and similar negative emotions. Attachments makes you more likely to feel these emotions, and as such are forbidden by the Jedi. The darkside is often described as selfish, while the light side is often described as selfless. But what is actually the factor that causes you to shift to the dark side in a tangible way?   


Let's use Anakin as an example: He had attachments for years, both to his master, his wife, and his padawan. He is shown in both the movies and the Clone Wars that he frequently felt, and even acted upon emotions such as fear, anger, and jealousy. He used powers like Force Choke rarely, killed unarmed or non-threatening foes even when there was alternative methods to capture available. He acted on hatred, anger, and revenge to kill sandpeople in Episode 2, even killing innocent children who had nothing directly to do with his mother's death. There is more, but you get the point. Despite the 3 or so years of fighting this way throughout the Clone Wars, Anakin didn't fall to the dark side and was never considered or shown to be someone who was ""dark side"". Despite everything, it seemed like he never really crossed the ""line"" to the dark side until he pledged himself to Palpatine.  


Sure, he struggled before, and earlier events probably made him more open to turning dark later- but it seems like even using Dark Side powers occasionally (such as his use of force choke) or being selfish and acting on negative emotions- even to kill a bunch of sand people, alone don't turn someone to the dark side. So what does? Is it constantly behaving in that way? or is it using dark side force powers too often? Is the Dark Side just something you consciously submit too and then it corrupts you? Or is it something that slowly takes away your judgement and inhibitions over time, like frequent drug use? If it is the latter, is it like Alcohol, where in controlled moderation, it isn't as bad as the Jedi make it out to be? If so, where is the line drawn between moderation and ""one too many""?  


 If the force works in this way, why do the Jedi forbid attachments and even feeling in these ways, or acting upon these feelings, while claiming it leads to the dark side, despite the fact that Anakin (and many other Jedi in different stories) can act this way for years at a time and not turn? It looks like turning is either a very conscious choice or like succumbing to a drug addiction- but that doesn't line up to the Jedi teachings. If the force was alcohol, it feels like the Jedi response to alcoholics would be that they shouldn't even think about or tolerate the thought of alcohol, and should condemn any who drink even if they do so responsibly. If you include Star Wars video games, like KOTOR, just being an asshole or threatening people makes you dark sided. Yet Luke threatened people in Return of the Jedi, and arguably used force choke as well. Was he Dark Side, or becoming more dark side at that point? If so, how does that affect him, where is the line before he ""falls""? If that line is the point where one is dark sided, why don't the Jedi focus their teachings on not crossing that specific line, instead of the nuclear option of forbidding so much normal things, like basic human emotions.",StarWars,GoldTruth,False,/r/StarWars/comments/ihab2u/how_does_turning_to_the_dark_side_work/

19,Why Disney's Star Wars sends a bad message to little girls.,1598478986,"According to the head of Lucasfilm, Kathleen Kennedy, she tried to shift Star Wars to be about girl, that alone isn't what killed the franchise, its that she neglected the other hlthe male audience while also destroying the whole in the process. I have taken care of children of many different ages and I care about and understand how impressionable they are, so people like Kathleen Kennedy and her yes-boys make me mad.

To further understand, consider that fact George Lucas made Star Wars for 12 year old boys, yet it still appealed to girls, especially as it had strong female characters along with the boys, starting with Princess Leia, then later we got Padme and Ahsoka. Leia was a strong leader who would head into danger to complete the task, then fighting to escape. Padme could handle herself in combat situations as seen on Geonosis and Clone Wars. Ahsoka may be be young, but she shows peesistence and determination that could inspire young girls to be just as such. 

This is how you appeal, these female characters were both strong, and relatable role models Rey on the other hand is a bad role model. Because she is just able to use force powers with no training, she doesn't teach girls to work for strength, she instead teaches that strength and power should just be handed to you, which is a harmful message to be teaching any young child. There's also Rose who is distastefully selfish. As Fin was about to do a heroic sacrifice to save the ones he love in a one-for-all move, Rose interrupts it, proving she prefer all-for-one, with her as the one, which causes many further deaths. There's also Holdo, who doesn't know how to run an army and behaves like a villain yet still treated as if she was the hero, and no, one sacrifice isn't good enough, especially when you have more money to spend on better writers. She keeps important need to know secret to the people who are the need to know in order to function. This shows little girls that people should just believe whatever she says and don't question it, which leads to a dishonest nature in impressionable children. 

These are just sample examples for what George did right and what Kathleen did horribly wrong. People give hate to George Lucas over stuff like the prequels, but no matter what you think of the prequels, we can all at least say that he wasn't actively trying to harm the youth, whereas maybe you can see Kathleen Kennedy's Star Wars as sending out a harmful message with her ideals on Star Wars. There is still hope, however, as seen in Manadlorian and Clone Wars final season that some good writers were able slip pass Kennedy to continue to make good stories.",StarWars,LimeGrass619,False,/r/StarWars/comments/ih8eqg/why_disneys_star_wars_sends_a_bad_message_to/

21,my thoughts on lighsaber combat,1598477885,"A quick disclaimer. I'm a fan of Star Wars, but not to the point of knowing every detail of SW canon. So I'm not exactly sure how lightsaber combat is supposed to work in the lore.

Obviously we're not discussing here some obvious flaws that lightsabers should have scientifically speaking, like melting your face away the moment you turn it on (because of how much power it's supposed to generate). So let's skip that.

I actually spent quite some time researching how lightsaber combat should work in real life for the purpose of my own stories as well as out of curiosity. So I just wanted to share my thoughts and maybe get some feedback.

### 1: Facts about lighsabers.

Here are some key aspects of this kind of weapon that are important IMO:

* the blade weights almost nothing and has no inertia,
* no additional power is required behind the strike to cut things,
* the blade can be repositioned almost instantly,
* speed is needed to compensate for lack of mass to block lightsaber strikes.

### 2: Quick strikes and fake attacks.

That fact that a plasma blade cuts through things so easily and weights next to nothing makes this weapon a good fit for rapier style of combat, with a lot of stabs and knocking opponent's blade aside. After all just one cut is likely to be fatal. It's also very easy to do fake strikes to lure the opponent's blade into unfavorable position in order to attack. In fact this is exactly how Count Dooku fights in the prequels.

I was, however, pointed out many times that this style of combat requires a specific handle and also doesn't fare too well against blaster bolts.

### Force Push and Force Pull

I think that those Force powers should be more prominently used in combat than we see it in the movies. Pushing your opponent or pushing his lightsaber aside seems like very useful strategy and I'd say it would be often used by experienced Jedi who have no problem both fencing and using basic Force powers.

Also by assisting your own muscles with The Force it is possible to strike harder, jump higher and change the position of your body instantly. I imagine that things like that would change the situation quite a bit in your favor.

### 3: Two-handed grip.

I don't agree with those claiming that wielding a lightsaber with both hands would be useless. I think it could be useful for deflecting enemy's attacks or blaster bolts.

Though it seems like a fighting style that would be significantly slower than the one based on rapier.

### 4: Sword spinning.

Another way to parry attacks could be to spin your sword in order to have the speed you can later convert into power, allowing you to deflect blaster bolts and parry attacks.

I imagine that this particular fighting style would basically be very precise and geared towards fighting with many opponents by attacking with the very tip of your blade which would obviously have the biggest speed.

The pro of this fighting style would also be the fact that by spinning the blade you cover most of your body, making you safer.

28,The problem about the claims about political agendas and or sides of new Star Wars.,1598475550,"      People generally complain about newer Star Wars for having too much political stuff in the films. The problem is that Star Wars was originally about politics. It was about the rise and fall of an empire and a group of terrorist taking down a general government.       For example If you look into Vietnam and reflect on our actions as the American people for American viewers, you can see on how we relate to the empire in many ways and there questionable military tactics.       You can say that newer Star Wars was more on identity politics and yes that‚Äôs true. In my opinion forcing political beliefs is not good for children with a different political view. If your claiming that any fictional story with like a political point of view is both right and wrong. Wrong because your statement kind of aged well in a way and for yes with political messages on a certain audience than that‚Äôs correct.        What I am trying to say is that people need to be more open minded on when they claim these kind of tings. Yes the sequel story writing is bad in my opinion but you need to see what the other side says about you. You might be seen as the bad guy but on your opinion you see yourself as the good guy. This is why I love Star Wars is because the similarities between REAL events that have happened and are being shown in a science fiction/ fantasy style franchise.     One of the reasons why I don‚Äôt like it as much anymore is the fan response. Whilst making some good points, others don‚Äôt really apply when you do deep research into what they are talking about in there statements.",StarWars,Space_Potatoroid302B,False,/r/StarWars/comments/ih7bol/the_problem_about_the_claims_about_political/

49,"I wrote a Star Wars Movie for fun, practice, and perspective. This was my experience.",1598470937,"# TL;DR

As a screenwriting challenge (and a nerdy exercise), I recently wrote a Star Wars movie. Custom characters. Custom story. Signature Star Wars setting, tone, and feel (hopefully). The current draft is a whopping 169 pages (I know). All in all, it was an incredibly fun challenge and educational process. I detail some thoughts and observations from the process below...

# THE CONTEXT

There's been a lot of negativity surrounding Star Wars as of late, and it's made me feel a bit conflicted as a fan. Instead of debating what's already been written, I wanted to experience the opposite perspective on the process, first-hand -- I wanted to experience the challenge of trying to write a compelling Star Wars story for the big screen. And I had a premise I was excited to explore.

About 9 months later (and some major stopping and starting), I've walked away from this process with a beefy 169-page first draft and a much better appreciation for why this is such a meaningful and challenging universe that we love.

I did it for fun. For practice. And for perspective on the franchise as a conflicted fan.

But mostly I did it for fun.

# MY CRITERIA

1. Write a movie set anywhere in the Star Wars universe.
2. Write a movie that could start a new Star Wars trilogy.
3. Write a movie with at least a reasonable length. *Reasonable*. (The most difficult one for me)
4. Write a movie with a story that I would want to see.

# 12 THINGS I LEARNED

**1) Wookiepedia is the best co-pilot.**

&gt;*I'm sure this will come as no surprise. But when you're writing a story in this insanely massive universe, an online encyclopedia really comes in handy. Being a nerd who's already pretty familiar with Star Wars expanded lore helped, too.*

**2) Writing a strong SW opening crawl is hard!**

&gt;*If this were ""A Star Wars Story"" type of film (like Solo or Rogue One), I wouldn't need one. But since I was trying to write something that could spark a hypothetical trilogy, I went for it. It had to set the stage, the backdrop, and the immediate first scene that followed. And I had to do it in approximately three to five very expositional sentences.*

**3) Introducing new characters is my favorite challenge.**

&gt;*In this script, virtually the entire cast is comprised of custom characters, just like any original work. But because this is part of a pre-existing franchise with such iconic, powerful characters already, I felt like this might make the story even less appealing to fans and potential readers who were already skeptical.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*This led me to one of the most valuable storytelling exercises I've ever put myself through -- how can I make you like and care about multiple characters as quickly as possible? How can I get you invested in their journey? My solution was to confront them with significant challenges and decisions right upfront. Like, within the first 10-20 pages. And as the story continued, I had to keep myself in check and make decisions based on them and their journey -- not the greater universe of Star Wars.*

**4) It was better to focus on Story/Character over World-Building.**

&gt;*When I started, I had some trouble determining how much lore detail to include throughout the action. Every gun has a name. Every ship has a name. Every species and every droid and every crack and crevice everywhere -- Star Wars canon is just so detailed! But in a screenplay, those details get bloated real fast. The real-estate of the white page is already so precious. So, I kept it as minimal as possible without hopefully contradicting established canon. Speaking of which...*

**5) Canon is sacred. But there are gaps...**

&gt;*This script should not interfere with established SW canon in any way (SW Legends is a different story). In fact, repeatedly checking to make sure I followed current canon actually helped to trigger new, better story ideas throughout the process. However, when you research canon, you also begin to identify 'gaps in the record'. And that's where you get to go a little nuts.*   
&gt;  
&gt;*Some of my favorite sequences to write took advantage of something in SW lore already established and then fleshed them out in new ways that helped move the plot along.*

**6) Finding that 'signature Star Wars feeling' is hard to describe and harder to achieve.**

&gt;*That signature 'Star Wars' feeling is easy to identify but hard to quantify. Truth be told, I think one of the biggest lessons I took away from this process was that there is no set definition of what makes Star Wars Star Wars -- at least not one that everyone can agree upon. For better or worse, the Original Trilogy, Prequel Trilogy, and Sequel Trilogy all have distinctly different feels from each other. But there are also some very strong constants: Space battles, Lightsaber Battles, Light vs. Dark, Supernatural Mysticism, Swashbuckling Adventure, Alien Oddities... I tried to put it all in there.*   
&gt;  
&gt;*I paid homage to what I could without trying to copy or mimic. But I don't know how successful I was.*

**7) The Force is even more brilliant than I had initially believed.**

&gt;*The Force is a huge storytelling ally. Without getting into specifics, my story features Jedi, the Force, the Light Side, and the Dark Side. Writing a story with these mystical elements was intimidating. But once I got into it, I actually found it to not just be fun but even convenient. I hope I didn't use The Force in any way that feels like a cop-out. But it is useful as hell for giving characters new information or setting up new plot moments.*   
&gt;  
&gt;*Most of all, though, I found the Force to be an excellent agent in creating atmosphere throughout the story. It really lends itself to this permeating feeling that there is something so much bigger at play than these characters alone. It almost makes it feel like the Galaxy itself is watching and waiting to see what these characters will do, which only serves to emphasize the choices they do or do not make.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*I really feel like I learned to appreciate how the Force empowers all SW movies (even the ones that have not been my favorite). The way it adds such an immersive feeling of mystery and unseen wisdom in everything is phenomenal and something I really enjoyed trying to add to this story.*

**8) Battle scenes are exhausting to write.**

&gt;*""They fight..."" - George Lucas*  
&gt;  
&gt;*I've never written an actual 'battle' scene before, let alone one that involves more than two or three people, let alone one that involves spaceships or lightsabers. It is a very draining process just trying to find synonym after synonym for 'parry' or 'fire' or 'blast'... Beyond the words, though, the actual rise and fall of tension, suspense, thrill, and violence within a single battle is heavy. Not to mention tone! Is there room for witty banter? Or is this a deeply serious live-or-die moment? Can you cut away halfway through or would it be too much of an interruption?*  
&gt;  
&gt;*One thing that helped me with battle scenes (and action scenes in general) was to always anchor the scene around a tangible goal beyond the action, alone. I credit this discovery to my extra-nerdy experiences playing Star Wars tabletop roleplaying games. If you're trying to create an especially fun and engaging combat encounter for your players, one of the worst things you can do is have the only objective be to 'kill the enemy.' They're trying to get to a ship. Or they're trying to find and speak to a member of the enemy for some reason. Idk, maybe this sounds like common sense, but you can get lost in the action part of the action pretty easily when you have to write it all down on paper.*

**9) There is beauty in a 'Simple' Plot.**

&gt;*A simple plot can still be extremely rich. My interpretation of a 'simple' plot is a story in which the goals and stakes are as clear-cut and streamlined as possible. The complexity and nuance of the journey do not come from the problem, but from the pursuit of the solution. When the problem is easy to understand, we can naturally spend more screentime on how these characters try to overcome their obstacles, rather than setting up the obstacle itself. In that way, we maximize our opportunity to connect with them more and get invested in their story.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*In my opinion, the OT really excelled at this idea (Find Kenobi, Rescue the Princess, Destroy the Death Star). I also think it might be the reason Rogue One resonated with so many fans as well as it did. I tried to emulate this as much as possible in my script. I think it really comes through in the first half of the story. I wrote the entire first Act of the movie around this principle: the characters are just trying to get something and get it to safety for the entire Act.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*The second half of the story, however, is another matter...*

**10) There is beauty in an 'Intricate' Plot.**

&gt;*In general, I think the more intricate or complex the stakes and obstacles are, the more likely you are to alienate your audience. But with Star Wars, there is such a rich variety of lore and mysticism to tap into -- exploring or even adding onto that mythos can be an extremely fascinating and rewarding experience as both a storyteller and also as a fan.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*This is probably where I'm most curious and unsure about how my script plays out. Unfortunately for me, the main premise behind this SW story idea (the idea that got me really excited in the first place) demanded a high level of complexity and intrigue going on in the backdrop of the main story. I was able to avoid it in the first half of the story, focusing instead on establishing the characters and their personal journeys. But the second half of this movie (and specifically the final act) is one of the most complicated things I've ever written so far. There was just so many things to pay-off. It was like throwing a dozen plates into the air and then having to safely catch each one of them by the end without it feeling rushed, confusing, or underwhelming. This is a big reason for the length -- 160 pages as opposed to the more comfortable feature-length film length of 120 pages.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Ultimately, I truly do not know if I succeeded. But I was very happy to complete the process, hitting all the plot points I had in my outline. The whole thing was an invaluable challenge.*

**11) I can write a movie.**

&gt;*One of my biggest hurdles on this was the sheer scale of the project. I've only written TV scripts before this, coming in at around 60 pages at most. I'd never written a feature-length film of any kind before this, let alone one with such a large-scale premise and world.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*The script is probably about 40 or so pages too long, and it's essentially formally formatted fan-fiction. But the inspiration and momentum were there. And I followed it... and it took roughly 9 months.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*I started in December 2019. My first internal deadline for myself was to try and finish before the end of February. That did not happen. By February, I dropped the project for a variety of IRL reasons.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*By August 2020, I was itching to get back into writing several original projects that I'd only barely started. But before I could get to those, I wanted to finish this one first. My goal was to finish it by August 28th, 2020. Not only did I beat this 2nd deadline, I beat it by several weeks. I've been using the time since to proofread and tweak some things here and there and get some very light preliminary feedback.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*No matter how terrible it is, this was a huge accomplishment for me.*

**12) I need to be better about asking for and accepting criticism.**

&gt;*I won't say it's good. I won't say it's short. And I certainly won't say it's ""finished"" (no script ever really is).*  
&gt;  
&gt;*But I'm trying to put myself out there more and get more comfortable in receiving feedback and critique on my work. I've got other original scripts, but my hope was that Star Wars is a much more universally recognized category of story. Most people already have a certain level of understanding and familiarity with what to expect and how the world works. For that reason, I felt like this script could be an opportunity for me to access more feedback than before.*

If, somehow, you're still here and are interested in reading the script, below is the link to the PDF. 

As I said, I did this for fun, for practice, and for perspective. But mostly for fun. I really did have a lot of fun. And if you're interested in reading it, I hope you might, too.

72,Been thinking about Shmi Skywalker...,1598464157,"I recently did a release-order rewatch of the films (and films only) with a friend that had never seen Star Wars, bless her. When we watched TPM I paid more attention to Shmi Skywalker than I had before and it dawned on me‚Äî had Shmi been Force-sensitive, she could have been a far greater Jedi than Anakin ever was. 

I mean, think about it. The Jedi way is all about mastering your feelings, right? Not giving in to anger or fear or despair, and acting for the good of all rather than the good of yourself, right? Shmi was entirely self-sacrificing for Anakin and for the Naboo party, giving her parental consent (not to be confused with approval) for Anakin to race the pod so that the Naboo stranded on Tatooine could get home, sending her only boy to go grow up without her as a Jedi and telling him not to look back (essentially to let her go) when she did it because a Jedi knight she‚Äôd never heard of told her that her son would save the galaxy. She trusted her gut, and she did what she felt was right the whole way, despite her personal feelings on the matter. Shmi had a level of control over her feelings that Anakin never got, despite her years of enslavement and having her child sent far away from her. She could have come out the other end of that experience with more emotional baggage than her son! But she didn‚Äôt!

I could go on for days about how Anakin‚Äôs training was emotionally mishandled, but that‚Äôs not my point here. My point is that Shmi, from an emotional standpoint, had the potential to be the Jedi Anakin WISHES he could be. And had she been force-sensitive and given Jedi training, I think she would have been a force to be reckoned with, not unlike Obi-Wan and Yoda. Shmi is the matriarch of the Skywalker bloodline, and she has firmly earned the respect the fandom widely denies her.

My argument is that it would have been perfectly possible to have Kylo Ren be the main villain in the third film. Having a sympathetic villain isn't a particularly unusual thing, nor is having a redeemable villain who ultimately rejects redemption. I think having his character play out that way would have been far more interesting. And indeed that's the direction the Duel of Fates script would have taken the film in.

The opposing argument is that after his character development in TLJ, Kylo *had* to be redeemed, because choosing not to do so would have been out of keeping with the tone of the space fairy tale universe the films operate in. And/or that Kylo was too sympathetic to work as a villain and that a big bad like the Emperor was needed.

12,Why the Old Republic should be Star Wars' next major saga,1598453450,"It's pretty safe to say that Star Wars is in an interesting place right now. The divisive sequel trilogy has, for the time being, capped off the Skywalker saga. Though there are new trilogies and anthology films currently in development, Disney seems to be focusing primarily on TV shows like The Mandalorian and video games like Fallen Order, both of which have been almost universally well-received by fans and critics alike. There are even rumors (though not from any reputable source, as far as I can tell) that Disney is planning to de-canonize the aforementioned sequel trilogy in order to have more creative freedom with the Disney+ shows, most of which will be set after the events of Return of the Jedi, as well as to win back fans who felt alienated by the trilogy. (Again, the rumors don't seem legitimate, but it is worth noting that Disney seems to have virtually no sequel-era projects in the works except for the  Poe Dameron prequel novel, and there are also more reliable rumors that Galaxy's Edge will be re-themed around the original trilogy era with a CGI Luke Skywalker. The more likely idea is that Disney will simply ignore the events of the sequel trilogy without officially de-canonizing it.) 

But regardless of what Disney decides to do with the era of the Skywalker saga going forward, I think I know what the next big saga of Star Wars should be, and it's right in front of Disney's face: the Old Republic. 

Now, in case you are unfamiliar with the Old Republic era, it's the name (in both Canon and Legends) given to the era of any events that happened a thousand years or more before the events of Episode I. Popular characters from this era (some of whom are still canon) include Revan, Darth Bane, Bastila Shan, Kreia, Darth Nihilus, Exar Kun, and Meetra Surik. When the Expanded Universe was de-canonized and rebranded under the name Star Wars Legends, one thing fans were particularly upset to lose was the stories of the Old Republic era, which were told primarily through a popular video game series as well as tie-in novels and comic books. 

Some of you may dismiss this idea, saying that you've had enough of prequels. While I certainly understand that sentiment, the Old Republic is far more than just a prequel; rather, it is the closest thing to a reboot that Star Wars could get. Even though it's set in the same galaxy many centuries ago, it has a completely different status quo and feel to it than stories set during the Skywalker era. The Jedi and the Sith are both in their true primes. This is far different than what we've seen before, because the villains had the advantage in the original trilogy and the sequel trilogy, while the heroes (seemingly) had the advantage in the prequel trilogy. A war between two powerful organizations led by the Jedi and the Sith would be amazing to see. 

And, even though there is already some great source material to work with, Disney doesn't have to just adapt everything. They could put their own spin on it and change it up, making something fans truly haven't seen before. 

As for the ""saga"" part, that's exactly what I mean. I don't think the story of the Old Republic should be simply confined to a trilogy. I think this is Disney's chance to make a massive story that includes films as well as TV shows, comics, novels, and even video games. 

In short, I think that Disney should look to the future by looking to the past.",StarWars,ElijahCookOfficial,False,/r/StarWars/comments/ih084c/why_the_old_republic_should_be_star_wars_next/

This keeps most of the new characters except a few like smoke, and focused on more important things but romains similar to the Prequels in general. I know I missed out a lot, but this would have been much better ending to the Skywalker Saga:

(Undecided on the title of films, that I am not final on) 

Film 1: Rise of The New Republic 

Queen Leia Skywalkers New Republic is being challenged by The First Order lead by a mysterious Sith Lord. She has romained broken ever since her son betrayed her and joined the r first order.

Luke trapped himself into the force as he helped stall for the new jedi he trained for 30 years after the Return of the Jedi to get away. The new jedi lead by Ben Skywalker, Lukes Canon son was transported for a save haven until it was safe, but was not heard from again. A droid called BB-8 has located a blueprint to help get luke out of the force, but it is hidden.

Enter Rey, the last Kenobi, though unaware of it, who is the only one who can access the map because she has the special force powers she inherited. She is found by Princess Leia, who tells her who her grandfather was, Obi-Wan, and does not mention her parents. Inspired, Rey joins her.

When she gets back, she is trained how to fight by Rebel leader Han solo, and she joins his personal army.

Meanwhile, The First order plots to use the Blueprints (That can bring luke back from the force) to bring back grandmaster palatine. Why is unknown.

Soon after the Rebels find BB-8, They meet Finn, a clone trooper who escaped the first order. He gives the droid and joins the rebels. The first order finds them, and han sacrafice himself so they could escape. 

Leia then confronts Rey about the force, because only a powerful force user could activate the blueprinted machine to get luke back, and Rey being a Kenobi was the only way. Leia taught her the basics about the force, so she could return luke, and does.

Film 2: Fall of The New Republic

In the second film, we see luke train her, but for some reason she is not like the other jedi - still missing. She has a dark that not even luke can see. So she is told to go to the temple of the first jedi to see a way to balence this.

Meanwhile luke and Leia, both lightsaber bound, search for Ben and the missing jedi. When they found the jedi and mara-jade, the first order attack. The jedi battle the Knights of Ren, but are defeated and captured. The first order get the Blueprints they need to get palatine.

The mysterious Sith Lord talks with Kylo, and reveals Bens Backstory - his turn from the jedi, his evil, his character development. 

After Rey finds balance she finds luke and the jedi are being captured. With Finn and a pilot called poe they ambush the first order and manage to free luke and Ben, with Rey the rest captured.

Film 3: The Rise of the Jedi

In the final and third movie, Luke Leads the rest of the new Republic to the first order, whrere they clash and have a battle.

Rey is united with Kylo, and the plan is revealed, as is Reys Backstory. Obi wan had a daughter who fell in love with the biological son of palatine, Aldo. They birthed Rey, but Kenobi daughter was killed soon after by Aldos brother, the other son of palatine, who captured and tortured alodo. Aldo too birthed a child, who would be the mysterious sith Lord who is now the leader of the first order.

In order to charge the Mega-canon, not like the death star, being a Literal cosmic Canon, it required 3 palpatines: The Sith Lord, Emperor Palatine and Rey. Together, it would end the Republic.

Rey refues and says she fights for her mother and grandfather and battles The Sith Lord and Kylo.

Suddenly, Luke and the Republic break in to help, battleing with each other. Rey loses to the sith Lord while luke killed him shortly after. Kylo is then beat by Ben Skywalker, his cousin.

But the Blueprints had already been put to word and palatine had been brought back.

Luke claims all his father sacrafice was for nothing and he had to end it. Rey, Ben and Luke faced off with palatine, and They ultimately lose. Luke then sacrafice himself to destroy the Sith once and for all, and became one with the force.

The rebels escaped and rebuild the jedi, with Rey dining herself Rey Kenobi and by Ben Skywalkers side, would lead the jedi. Leia peacefully passes on her sleep, and Kylo Ren renounces his name and starts anew with the jedi again, and Ben is crowned ruler, with the guide of his of his mother mara jade.

65,Obi-wan Kenobi is a Sith Lord.,1598424950,"There is no emotion, there is peace - Jedi code

Not sure if you guys watched the prequel movies but clearly Obi-Wan is sith. Most likely indoctorinated after his rageful killing of Darth Maul. He is the one that sets the plan in motion of Anakin's turning by promoting a special relationship with the Emperor. Throughout the prequels there are many times Kenobi disregards his former master and blatley lets his emotions run rampant while developing what could be seen as taboo relationships in the eyes of a Jedi, according to their code.
 
If the Jedi truly value all life, Kenobi must have had the foresight to end Anakin, either to spare future lives, or the very least show compassion and end his suffering. Kenobi knew damn well what he did is his own fit of anger; and seeing how much easier it was to control Grievous than a humanoid, why not impose some sort of futuristic control mechanism ahead of time if this was the Emperor's plan.

The end of Revenge of the Sith also left a lot of loose gaps. It's hard to fathom that a technical droid army would instantly lose the war and stop day 1 once Grievous died. WW2 didn't stop just because Hitler was killed, there was a whole set of new events that occurred afterwards. Now lets say the senate does turn into a dictatorship and the jedi council is dead. Do all the other remaining generals besides Kenobi agree to Palpatine's new dictatorship? How come there was no real resistance with what was left of the clone army agaisnt Palpatine during or after order 66, after all the jedi control the clones. At this point Kenobi could have established his own coup d'etat and atleast attempted to over throw the senate, rather than burn the last great flame against the oncoming sith darkness that is about to consume to galaxy. Instead Kenobi serves up Anakin on a plate to Palpatine, lays claim to Anakin's childern, and proceeds to abandon his post and allow the senate to crumble. This sounds exactly like a Darth Sidious operation, having his underling do all the serious important work. There is also no way Sidious would have let Anakin die being so closely related to the prophecy and the potential harnessing of whatever myticisms come with it. Anakin also becomes the Emperor's will embodied, which is no small feat. I highly doubt the Emperor would have chosen someone to rule with him during the end game without being picked before hand. After all Sidious does start to groom Anakin before Dooku's demise. This would also give a different side of Kenobi's rage as well. Having Kenobi foresee he is being replaced by Anakin due to the rule of 2. Now this is where I might be streching, but due to the loss of Maul and the war being on his doorstep, Insidious actually picked up two students unknown to each other, as a safegaurd for his assault against the Jedi, having a back up just in case. However this would give a different reason why kenobi flees to tatooine. 

Once kenobi is on tattoine he plots his revenge against his former master and his new apprentice by using an old sith trick, subterfuge. Earlier I mentioned Vader being the will embodied, this pertains to Sidious being the ultimate conduit for the dark side (master), while Vader carries out his will (apprentice). Kenobi then grooms the will embodied's childern to sow future confusion and hatred between the master and apprentice. If Kenobi truly cared about the Jedi why did he sacrafice himself instead of fleeing. Why was Leia not trained by him earlier or after luke? Instead he allows her to remain in the Emperor's pocket. He even claims he will be more powerful if struck down, and is rightfully done so, filthy Sith. 

*Kenobi sith-arc also makes sense after Return of the Jedi.* (Pretext first) The rule of two was developed by the last remaining Sith, after the Sith were nearly destroyed by the Jedi. The Jedi took advantage of the infighting amongst the Sith and brought them to all but one. This must have had some repercussions on the force. As they say, all things must be in balance, which must be true for both the light and the dark. I am sure this is purposeful in the writing material as a single Sith brought the destruction of all but one Jedi (Luke) and this natural balance was most likely to end the Jedi at some point, Sith or no Sith (I believe these are themes of the newest movies)(Pretext done). *The in-fighting between Sith (Kenobi and Palpatine) was the result of Sith nature which, through the force, lead to the Unbalancing of the force once more when Luke ends both Vader and Palpatine, creating a natural Yin cycle within itself, obtaining power so vast it ends up both self destroying and self creating.* Yin will always be as long as there is a Yang.

72,"The ""Balance to the Force"" problem, and the future of SW",1598421698,"I've always been bugged by the movies touting of bringing balance to the Force, and since the Skywalker Saga is set in stone, I had a crazy thought.

In the expanded universe, after the original trilogy, we saw the incursion of outside forces threatening the galaxy which the Skywalker progeny took on, the recreation of a Jedi Academy, exc.

With The Rise of Skywalker, we saw diads in the force, and Rey surviving to take on the Skywalker name.  I was thinking where the franchise could go from here, and had a thought:

What would people think of a new SW chapter following tRoS, wherein Rey starts a Diad academy?  Instead of the failed Jedi order of not embracing the dark side at all or the Sith's rule of two, a new Diadic order wherein force users always work and operate as a Diadic unit comprised of a Diadic Knight who leans towards light and a Diadic Knight who leans towards the dark side?

I was brainstorming ideas for how such a unit could operate and what rules these ""Diadic Knights"" could follow.  One rule being - should one of the unit be killed, the other must take their own life.  They are raised together as younglings and paired off according to their leaning, and working as a unit balance one another out - as we've seen throughout the series that more often than not individuals lean more to one side than the other and rarely are able to walk a fine line between the two.

I envisioned scenes of the Diadic unit investigating a suspect, literally having a ""good cop, bad cop"" like dynamic in the interrogation process.  A story could unfold revolving a powerful light leaning Diadic Knight going on the run and refusing to take their own life after losing their dark side pairing, and a newly formed Diadic Knight pairing sent to hunt this lone wolf down, lest the balance of the force that was implemented be lost.

This could also lead into a larger story, where the Diadic Knights are called upon to stop the invasion of an extreme alien force.  This new alien enemy sees the force as a threat - and believes that no balance could ever be enforced in the long term.  As such, any society that practices using the force is seen as a threat to be eliminated by the alien extremists.

Lots of evidence states that the officers and possibly admirals (except for Tarkin) more  or less had to take orders from him or his inquisitors, and he could do as he pleased. Palpatines advisors also knew of him too considering he is seen with them on the Death Star II.

However, did the average citizen of the empire know of Vader? Palpatine was obviously a part of the daily imperial life as he was the Emperor, but what was Vader‚Äôs place in regular Imperial society? Did the average citizen know of his existence? Did he have an official title? Did he make public appearances? Did he have a supposed ‚Äújob‚Äù known by the public? He has a castle, but it‚Äôs on a planet perpetually erupting that most people don‚Äôt go to.
