20,Star Trek: Discovery Season 2 reflections,1590890374,"I hated everything about the first season of this show, and was ready to abandon it. Morbid curiosity and recommendations from fellow Trekkies made me watch the second season, and I'm so glad I did! I am truly impressed with how much improvement Discovery showcased in just one season.

Michael Burnham is a much better and fleshed out protagonist in Season Two, and Martin-Green's acting must receive as much praise as the writers. Ethan Peck had arguably the least enviable task of the cast by inhabiting a much beloved character that has been favorably portrayed twice already, but he rose to the occasion and proved himself worthy of the challenge. While we still don't know everyone on this crew just yet, they feel more like a family this season than they did previously. Having previously complained about Saru and Tilly not being efficiently explored, I was delighted that both of them received a good chunk of development in this season. I was also very pleased with the complicated dynamic between Stamets and the ""resurrected"" Culber.

Let's be real, though. Anson Mount stole the show here. His portrayal of Captain Pike was masterful. He's gentle, decisive, measured, compassionate, and strong all at once. You can't help but fall in love with him, which is bittersweet given what we all know is coming.

The writing is immensely improved this season. The plot is much more focused, and there's a good balance between character development and the main conflict. Things start to get a *little* loosey goosey toward the end of the season with time crystals and nanobots, but the writing is good enough to overcome it. There's also a healthy amount of levity and comic relief throughout, something season one SORELY lacked.

I'm genuinely excited for the third season now, as well as Strange New Worlds. The ending of this season opened a door for big risks to be taken. Let's cross our fingers and hope Discovery doesn't succumb to the same fate as Voyager and become a mildly entertaining albeit gutless Star Trek series.",startrek,dastardlywong,False,/r/startrek/comments/gtqkp1/star_trek_discovery_season_2_reflections/

23,Just watched The Outcast and it was not what I expected,1590885644,"hello, everyone! hope you're all okay ♡

so, i just watched the outcast and it was not what i expected. i had no clue about the plot and once i understood, i was really surprised and overwhelmed about it. i always wondered why a society in the 24th century would stick to the female/male form of romantic relationship (specially when the talk about a bunch of aliens), but i thought 'hey, it must be because the time the show was written, of course' so i was pretty glad when i saw it was finally being discussed.

some considerations about it: i just saw a comment saying frakes later criticized the decision to cast an actress to portray soren and i totally agree. it could easily be a man or someone who does not identified as male/female. i do realised again, by the time it was written, maybe it wasn't going to be well accepted by the public. it got me wondering how this episode was received by the public back then. anyone here watched when it aired or something like that? i would like to know more.

25,Long Time Star Trek Fan Finally Watches DS9: Season 3 episode 1 + 2,1590879725,"Hi everyone! This is gonna be even more spoilery than most of these, because it’s going to be two episodes in lots of details, so if you’re watching with me make sure you’ve seen it already!

Also, because this is only two episodes, I would love to hear any and all random trivia, head cannons, theories, etc. 

I was pretty disappointed yesterday so I came into this mentally prepared for a space battle. I was ready for it. I was rarin’ to go. And we got a lil space battle. A severely outmatched, Sisko was underprepared space battle. He went in saying, “We’re here for peace, really, but we’re gonna go in cloked and sneak into things, and they DID warn us they would essentially shoot on site, but... we got this.” But I’m not here to complain about Sisko’s bad decisions. Also this one may have been Star Fleet’s bad decision. I couldn’t really tell.

Guys, I love Odo so much for so many reasons. I didn’t think I would love Odo when this show started but holy crap. His careful consideration and genuine respect for life, change and justice is honestly astounding. Stuff like this is what makes Star Trek art. I also think they do a wonderful job contrasting it to Julian’s reckless defense of life. They both want the same thing, and to me, it’s exhilarating in both cases, but Odo is much more measured and controlled. It’s like his goals and values are a more mature version of Julian’s. 

Every time Garak comes on screen, it’s pure gold. Do I need to say more? 

I loved watching Kira and Odo together. It was like Kira’s little brother discovered his identity and she’s watching him turn into something she’s proud of. She wants nothing more than for him to be happy. Except possibly to get off the planet and contact Sisko. But she nudged him for help so gently and respectfully. Essentially, “Uh, I need you to unlock this door. But you know, when you’re comfortable and ready.” I love the way they treat each other. Before that, Odo telling her he had to go to the planet and that she “Didn’t object at the time.” Well written, well executed. 

Dax was a little weird for me in this, but I did love when she burst into Sisko’s room asking if he’d seriously let them reassign her. 

I’ve started an art/DIY project while I watch this and when Odo got the door open I had to stop and replay it because honestly what on earth? Or not on earth? I am seriously impressed with this show’s ability to surprise me. I actually used to write a lot but stopped because I ran out of creativity and artistry. But this is such an awesome reminder that it’s me who is missing the expansiveness. There is so much creativity left out there. I need to take this time to learn what it means to be genuinely open minded (and people are constantly nudging me in the comments- thank you!).

58,"""Is There In Truth No Beauty?"" - First Time Viewing Reaction",1590844057,"Noob Trek 60 - Is There In Truth No Beauty?

Gosh, these titles get hammier all the time. I'm looking at the list of episodes and I'm seeing things like ""Whom Gods Destroy"", ""Let That Be Your Last Battlefield"" and our blue-ribbon prize ham ""For The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky"". (The blase ""Spock's Brain"" becomes even funnier in this company.) I'm not mocking the quality of those episodes, I haven't even seen them, maybe they're wonderful, but I'm noticing the show seems to be straining to be taken seriously with portentous titles like ""And The Children Shall Lead"" and ""Is There No Truth In Beauty?"" Maybe it was just the style at the time - I'm currently reading a bunch of Marvel Comics from the late 60s and I see a similar trend with every other story called ""When Titans Fall!"" or ""The Endless Tears Of The Wrathful Weeping Worlds Unfold!"" or  ""Torment Of The Spiraling Eternity!"" or ""Lo There Shall Come A Fisticuffs!"" My dad who was around at the time thinks comics and sci-fi which were maturing mediums often misunderstood as being for little kids were trying to use literary allusions and pretentious language to communicate that they were aimed at a more sophisticated audience.

Getting onto this episode, I find something highly amusing about the reveal that the ambassador is a tool box, followed by Nimoy's ceiling-touching eyebrows and a dramatic musical sting. It's too tedious to unpack detail by detail, but I'm fairly certain that the safety precautions taken regarding Kollos are inconsistent across the episode and illogical. But on a basic level, if he's in the box why do they need all the visors and people not being near him and so on? Why does he even physically visit if he's that dangerous, why doesn't he just use Zoom? Imagine, the great enlightened race of the universe and you get carried around in a construction worker's lunchbox.

Very early on I smugly call the plot/twist of the episode - the Medusan gets revealed at the end of the episode to be totally mundane, but they concocted some story about being horrific to make some bullshit philosophical point. I'm supremely confident of this. ANNNNNND within minutes I'm proven totally flipping wrong when Spock looks into the box. But you know what, I'm glad, it makes the story less predictable. The effects when they open the box are kind of cool. Unusual but they do evoke a sense of the sublime and unknowable. I wonder if this was an influence on Pulp Fiction at all.

It's a sign of how good Muldaur's performance is that I'm thinking to myself ""Is she a Vulcan? She's behaving like one, but I thought she was human, Jones is a human name etc"" before finding out that she is playing a human who has lived on Vulcan and therefore been influenced by its ways. She brings that across very well. Also, it's a nice bit of world building that telepaths go to live on Vulcan, where everyone is naturally telepathic for training and acclimatization. But wait, in the Star Trek universe there are just random telepathic humans popping up here and there? I don't think this has been previously established. I make up for my bad call on the nature of Kollos by realising that Jones id blind from the way she behaves after Spock leaves her with the ambassador, only this time I don't even realise I'm guessing a twist, I mistakenly think it's supposed to be evident from Jones' acting. But no, they're in the dinner scene and she's clearly sighted, so I'm wrong. Except it turns out I'm right! Further evidence of good acting from Muldaur. I also really like how they took a sci-fi convention of women wearing dresses with silly shinies all over them and made it a plot element, clever.

So they're having a captain's table, all in dress uniforms and with the senior officers in attendance.  It's so cute. The thirst for Jones is a bit jarring - there's something about Miranda. I suppose it's a product of the time when a woman was supposed to be flattered and validated by men's interest. Surprised no one throws a glass of water over McCoy. But moving on from these more earthly matters, Jones refers to Spock's IDIC and I have absolutely no idea what this is and look it up. Wow, there's a rabbit hole. It's amazing that it stands for Infinite Diversity in Infinite Combinations, which is the title of this Reddit (!), because it's such a 2010s sounding thing to say, I thought the Reddit title had modern origins. But it's also impressive to see lore this deep being introduced this way and reveals why the Vulcan society is admirable and so compatible with the Federation, as well as Spock's preoccupation with finding things which are fascinating. But it's a nice dinner scene, and when Jones has a flash of murderuous intent, I think we're getting a segue into an Agatha Christie style murder mystery, like the lights will come up and Jones is dead and the crew has to figure out which Larry did it, but we don't quite go there and we already sort of did with Wolf In The Fold anyway.

This episode has good soundtrack work. A really nice score - even the soppy love theme which plays when Kirk tries to romance Jones is good and I always hate those soppy love themes. It seems that somebody spent some money or time on music this season, it's far better than the recycled themes of last season.

Larry's not the best actor. I wonder if perhaps the unrequited love story would work better if Larry were removed and it were Spock having feelings for her. (You'd fix the pacing problem of Spock falling for Jones in fifteen minutes of screen time by inserting a back story about how he'd known her when she studied on Vulcan.) It's just that Larry is a character we don't know and aren't invested in, making it hard to care about his arc. AND he's the worst kisser ever, look at the face Jones makes after he kisses her. If a girl made that face after I kissed her I'd say ""Alright then, that's me ghosted"" and quietly leave. There's some good camera work here though, the sequence where Larry assaults the ambassador is effective and while his sudden transformation into Bruce Lee when he gets to the engine room is silly, at least it's entertaining. Frankham, the actor portraying Larry, does the insanity acting well, revealing why he was given the part despite his awkwardness during the romance scenes. It's a shame though, when this character was introduced I was like ""Oh cool, the guy who designed the Enterprise! This is going to lead to some interesting world-building dialogue/interactions!"" and then it's never mentioned again or made use of and he's dead on the floor, Sam Kirked.

This is a well-made episode. I've noted the camera work, the effects on Kollos, the soundtrack, and we see more cool effects when the Enterprise warps into uncharted space. But the episode's quality extends past production value when we see good writing at work as Kollos can be used to pilot them back home, bringing all the threads of the narrative together.

The good writing continues when we are tricked in a rather amusing way. At first, we learn that the way to distract and absorb all the mental powers of the lady genius while Spock mind links with the ambassador is for Kirk to take her on date and show her pretty flowers? Come on. This is insulting. and Kirk's coming off like a jackass. However, the way Jones easily sees through this ruse reveals that rather than reducing an intelligent woman to an idiot distracted by flowers and Shatner's charms, the writer is portraying her as sharper, better than that. (It's also further clue that she's blind - Kirk's charms and the pretty flowers go unseen.)

Wait aren't these the visors that guy in TNG wears?

Nimoy breaking from his Spock character is always delightful. It's unclear to me exactly how Kollos is able to pilot the ship successfully with the standard instrumentation the Enterprise has - I guess his species has some sixth sense or their psychic powers allow it. It's also well out of character for Spock to forget to put his visor on, but I guess the Kollos side of him was distracted. The episode has a lot going on though, it could've been strung out to end with Kollos returning them to known space, but they keep adding in complications and drama, it's a full-course meal.

Kirk's savage attack on Jones feel way OTT and is the bum note of the episode. I feel both Shatner and the script are at fault here, it's inelegantly written and over-performed. He just rips her to pieces with a bunch of wild accusations and then goes outside and says ""I shouldn't have done that."" Well why was the scene included then? If it wasn't not some scheme of Kirk's to manipulate Jones into behaving a certain why, did she we just watch Kirk lose his shit when the defining nature of the character is that he doesn't lose his shit? Perhaps it's supposed to be touching, like he's so upset that Spock may be dying that he's lashing out, but if that's meant to be the case it isn't communicated well.

In the end though, that's just a minor problem in the grand scheme of the episode, which was an interesting and entertaining of television which was both thematically and narratively rich. A good episode which I liked a lot.",startrek,Kayfim20,False,/r/startrek/comments/gte0e4/is_there_in_truth_no_beauty_first_time_viewing/

For a brief moment yesterday, Oculus had the Quest in stock and I jumped to order one. I'll also order the Link cable so I can connect it to my PC and basically use the Quest as a Rift :)

79,"Long Time Star Trek Fan Finally Watches DS9: season 2, episodes 22-26 (end of season two)",1590801653,"Okay, none of this was fun and lighthearted. Pretty much the opposite, actually.

I LOVED the episode where Julian saves Garak from the implant he’s addicted to. I loved Julian’s conviction. I also finally figured out I can’t trust a word Garak says (the first time he told Julian “why he was exiled.” I sat there thinking “no way.” Took me long enough). I don’t agree with the medical ethics of the situation necessarily but I believed in who Julian was in those moments so it didn’t bother me. And it is really thrilling to genuinely believe in a character.

The episode in the mirror universe honestly confused me a bit. Bashir shot mirror Odo with zero consideration which I found interesting. It’s funny because in the season finale they say he and Jadzia don’t have much combat experience but I have no doubt that either would do exactly what they need to in that sort of situation. I also just think it would have been really funny to see the crew’s reaction when Kira shows up in an evening gown while Julian was covered in soot. 

The Collaborator episode was extremely disappointing because I didn’t want Wynn (Winn?) to be in charge. That’s all I got. I love seeing Kira go through stuff but she could not disentangle herself here and should have had Odo investigate. But this is what I want to see more of.

The episode where O’Brien was on Cardassian Trial was just... odd. It just had no motivation behind it until Sisko explained it in the last few minutes. The entire episode was, “We can’t tell you anything except that he’s already guilty and scheduled for execution! You have no authority in this court.”

AND THE FINALE: you guys are going to hate me but I just wasn’t interested until that twist at the end where the telekinetic girl was working for the enemy. I still just don’t believe Sisko’s character. I don’t like Quark, and the kids mildly annoy me. The kids spent the whole episode trying to get into space only to have Miles jump on, undo their progress, and realize that if they had just waited they could have transported their guardians onto the ship. Then we had these (what I’ve always imagined are) pretty small shuttles getting into battle formation with a giant star ship, but oh no, it’s the big ‘ol star ship that gets blown up because there are no main characters on it. The ending was cool though, I really trusted that character for some reason, so I was actually surprised when she was a bad guy.

I did start the first few minutes of season three, and I’m not excited for the first couple episodes. The diplomacy and exploration of new species in greater detail is what makes DS9 unique and exciting to me. I don’t honestly understand why they, knowing that they had divided up territories to species like the Romulans and Cardassians, did not stop to think at some point that maybe this part the universe is claimed by some species. Shouldn’t they have tried to figure that out before they started romping around in it? I believe in the Star Trek motto, as well as the human spirit of, exploration. But at some point, we need to exercise some caution. Did we learn nothing from the Q? You would think, at some point, there would be some amount of caution. And while most of my commentary on episode 1 season 3 will be in the next post, I will say this: I’m annoyed that cloking devices in Bajoran space were illegal until somebody blew up a star ship because suddenly it’s personal to The Federation. 

Sorry, this was a really negative post. And I obviously haven’t seen the conclusion to this encounter with the Dominion so as alway (except with Quark), I’m keeping an open mind (okay, maybe a little with Quark, too). But I want to see more Garak. I want to see more Miles (I’ve said that in how many posts now? I like Miles). I want to see that absolutely beautiful side of Odo we got little glimpses of. I want to see more of the Vedec stuff, and how Bajor is interacting with THEIR OWN station. I want to see cool sciency stuff come out of the gamma quadrant, and I also want to see more life on station. This show has been super creative with the politics and scifi ideas to the point where a big space battle almost felt like a cop-out to end the season and start the new one. But I’m still looking forward to see how they play this out. I feel like DS9 is going to have to distinguish itself from other Star Trek series, even in the big space battles.",startrek,MrPotato2753,False,/r/startrek/comments/gt5fca/long_time_star_trek_fan_finally_watches_ds9/

82,DS9 Indescretion,1590800016,"So I'm going through DS9 for the first time and I just watched Indescretion.

I hate the way they portray Sisko and Kasidy's relation. It's that goofy 'women are better than men shtick.' To recap, Kasidy is taking a Bajoran trade route to be closer to Benjamin. Dax gives her the idea she can move onto the station somewhere. This give Benjamin reservation.

That night Kasidy is talking to Sisko about it. Sisko says, ""That's a big step."" And she basically walks off in the middle of dinner upset.  That's super childish. Sisko is literally just being honest and he's not even saying he doesn't want her there. It's calmly and maturely expressing his emotion and state of mind. So she gets mad and storms off during dinner because he doesn't automatically love the idea. That's so rude. So childish.

Later on Sisko meets up with Dax and Bashir. Sisko tells them the story and his friends tell him to apologize. Apologize for what? Being honest? The punchline being, once Sisko leave, Dax tells Bashir that it's a big step, Bashir says, 'a very big step.' They're conceding in private that Sisko was correct.

During the conversation Quark comes over and gives some over the top ridiculously chauvinistic advice, of course. As though to contrast a binary decision. ""Either the woman is in control and you have to apologize when she's being childish and petty even though you're right. Otherwise we'll end up in a world Ferengi where women are bare foot, pregnant, and can't work or talk to strangers."" ""So therefore, in the future it's better for men to be subservient.""

Later on Jake tells Sisko the same thing: apologize. Then Kasidy rubs it in, ""Jake's a smart boy(unlike you Sisko, you dumb fucker, you think relationships should be equal?)""

What a load of bullshit. How about they show equality in a relationship? Like they did in TNG. Picard and Vash, Troy and Worf, Crusher and the Trill. We can't have mature relationships where both parties act like adults uninterested in petty power struggles.

This must mean that the deceptively easy-looking seemingly drunken-Saturday-night-at-a-bar fighting system is actually much more difficult and sophisticated than it appears. It must've been a martial arts that no actor could simply be shown or trained to do. They had to bring in trained masters to fill in those scenes for them.

97,How much control did Michael Chabon have over PIC?,1590783698,"IMHO DSC is a very poorly-written and disjointed series (that I nevertheless forced myself to hate-watch in true Trekker fashion haha).

However... I've just burned through PIC and it's turned out essentially as frenetic as DSC (again, only IMHO). Now I'm wondering what this bodes for season 2, and whether Chabon is a) forced to obey the mercurial whims of a higher-up, or b) wasn't able to corral his co-writers, or c) simply might not be cut out for screenwriting.

What does everyone else think? Would we be better off if another writer took over the reins, or if Alex Kurtzman and/or Akiva Goldsman made themselves scarce, or some combination of the above? Or is it just a case of giving PIC (and DSC) more time to catch their stride?

I was just wondering what the most trusted portion of the crew was supposed to be before they got stranded. It's been a while since I watched all the beginning of Voyager just having gone back to some of the early episodes recently it had me wondering;

How did Chakotay  (the maquis rebel leader) and Tom Paris (disgraced officer and maquis sympathiser) so quickly become the higher up, most trusted inner circle of officers on the Voyager crew? Chakotay becoming Janeway's ""number one"".

It does make sense that Chakotay was given a somewhat high position in order to make the maquis feel integrated and keep them in line, especially at the beginning when things between them were quite rough.

Paris disgraced, I mean presumably when they get back to earth he still has time left to serve I think gets pretty inexplicably close to the top in such short order. Chakotay too upon returning should have been destined for a trial of some sort surely? It's a wonder they were in any great rush to get back at all...

28,Long Time Star Trek Fan Finally Watches DS9: Episodes 18-21,1590716148,"We got Garak! I finally started understanding what he was saying, but then all the double triple agent stuff blew me away. For some reason I was blindsided by pretty much every scene after he had after the lunch with Julian. Just constantly shocked.

 Quark was SUCH a jerk. And I mean more than usual. The way this show deals with women, sexuality and attraction is not my favourite from Star Trek in the first place, but this crossed so many lines. “Give up your whole life to stay with me or your students die.” What happened to no means no? This made my skin crawl. That being said, despite me generally liking Julian, I also think the way he treats women is problematic. I’m trying not to focus on the feminism in this series (and I think Dax and Kira do a lot to balance out a lot of the problematic stuff) but quite frankly, Quark’s behavior disgusted me. 

Where was Julian that whole episode? I thought he was the one working with Garak, and I liked that. I thought the characters work well together. Julian is willing to fight to understand Garak and I felt like I struggled along with him. It’s not as fun when Sisko gets the point immediately. 

And there were ZERO consequences for anyone. Kira and Siko agreed to a prisoner exchange. Odo freed the prisoners. He’s obviously not federation but Sisko is, and this action violated the Prime Directive. This was interference. And direct violation of orders. And did those Bajoran prisoners get released? 

AND SPEAKING OF ZERO CONSEQUENCES- Dax has issues. Now. This is the Dax I prefer to see. She’s adventurous, committed to her values, and strong. She didn’t compromise on her values- kept her promise, but didn’t deliver the death blow. But! She violated a direct order from Sisko. And what happened? She walked right back onto the bridge. There is zero discipline on this station, regardless of whether they are Star Fleet or not.

And finally, the Maquis. I feel like Kira gets lost in translation here. She’s Bajoran and this is technically a Federation issue, but she’s also Sisko’s SO and he essentially told her to shut up. I miss the relationship between Riker and Picard. I know they are obviously different characters but we’re almost two seasons in, he fought to keep her, and they still can’t work together. Other concerns: Where was Garak? Why wasn’t the Federation admin more involved? We’re risking war here, and the admirals basically said, “You better get this under control, Commander.” I just don’t understand his role here. Is he a peacekeeper? I thought he was there to babysit in case Cardassia came back. Is he now supposed to mitigate all nearby conflict? And while we’re at it, what’s Kira’s job? She’s the liaison officer but she does pretty much... everything else. And I dunno what’s going on with the Cardassian dude (Gal DuKat?) in those episodes. The ending of that two part episode was also underwhelming to an extent but it makes sense for DS9- they aren’t equipped to fight wars. Their job is to maintain peace. So it was the most reasonable ending which we don’t always see in Star Trek. 

I’m kind of hoping the next few episodes are a little more lighthearted. I want to see more of Kira. I miss Julian (who has been practically absent, maybe not in some of the last few at all), and I kind of want to see less focus on Dax but just watch her operate as part of the team instead of her own separate story. I also have a feeling we’re going to see more of the Marquis, and I’m just waiting to run into the Dominion they talked about in the Ferengi episode (which I forgot to talk about in that blog post because I did not like watching that episode).",startrek,MrPotato2753,False,/r/startrek/comments/gsjfyz/long_time_star_trek_fan_finally_watches_ds9/

35,From Voyager to Enterprise,1590708049,"So I've just finished watching all 7 seasons of Star Trek Voyager, for like the 5th(?) ti

\++++++++++me now - it's always been my favourite, mainly because of great character development. The cast has always drawn me in with each and every episode, my favourites being The Doctor and Seven.

I've watched some clips of TNG before, and although it wasn't bad, I don't think it compared to Voyager at all; in all fairness though I haven't watched TNG properly.

So today I took the decision to watch Enterprise for the first time, and I'll be honest the first episode has really pushed me away from wanting to watch any more. I know I can't get an accurate feel from just one episode, but honestly I think it's so bad. They've managed to make T'Pol appear really moody when she's supposed to be Vulcan \~ and no disrespect, but is that lip filler? Quite frankly, she looks like a b\*tch and I hate her already.

I've immediately been introduced to a steamy shower scene with so much sexual tension - closeups of T'Pol's nipples while she's being stroked by a half naked bulging guy? Why? I'm assuming they did this to mask poor writing, as well as bringing in a larger male audience, but quite frankly I'm just being deterred. Sure, Voyager has Seven of Nine in a skin-tight suit, but it's not shoved in my face nor anywhere near the level of sexualisation in the first episode of Enterprise.

All in all I just wanted to ask whether I'm in the minority here and whether it's worth watching still?

44,I prefer the season-long arcs to the episodic Star Trek format of old.,1590692221,"Bit of a disclaimer. I love the old school Star Trek. DS9 was one of my favourite Trek series growing up. As was TNG, and Voyager. I even enjoy the odd episode from The Original Series. With the advent of the new Trek shows such as Discovery and Picard, they have switched up the format of what we've come to know of Trek. The episodic style has been replaced with season-long story arcs, mysteries and cliffhangers, and the more I see of Discovery, the more I'm convinced that I prefer the season-long story format to the episodic format.

Don't get me wrong. Being a fan of old Trek I can appreciate the value and importance of the episodic format, as it often gives glimpses into the 'normal' life aboard a Starship which helps develop characters and introduces unique and interesting dialogue. Thing is, people who applaud the episodic format of old Trek and claim it is the only vision of Trek that should be shown on screen neglects to understand the time in which these shows were created. 

Like movies and music, television evolves constantly with the times. Virtually every TV show pre-2000s was in some form of episodic format. It allowed the viewer to dip in and out as they pleased and didn't require weekly dedication to understand the show, its characters, and their motives. This is most likely because there wasn't any ""on-demand"" availability back then, and most people, if they wanted to ensure they didn't miss an episode, they would have to use a VCR and tape the episode. But what if this wasn't possible for you, and for whatever reason, you weren't able to watch an episode? Season long arcs meant that if you missed an episode and then tried to pick it up the following week, you'd be lost in the show, and ultimately would likely lose interest altogether.

The growth of the internet, expansion in recording capabilities, and now on-demand, there's no need to worry if you miss the weekly episode, because you can just pick it up when you want. But this presents grander story opportunities that haven't been done in Trek before. Sure, there's an overemphasis on cliffhangers and mysteries, but the stories allow for greater depth in an adventure than was ever possible with original Trek. Watching Michael Burnham's progression throughout Discovery has been great to experience from start to finish. 

While we may have had this to some extent in original Treks, Discovery's format allows for a much greater emotional impact with the story because it is largely focused on Michael Burnham and her progression throughout the show. But along with that progression, you're introduced to the other characters that revolve around her, and you grow to love them too because of their closeness to Burnham and their involvement in her journey.

Could the writing be better on these new shows? Of course, but this is a very new way of telling stories within the Star Trek universe (without bringing the movies into the equation), and I'm really enjoying what they're doing with them.",startrek,Steven8786,False,/r/startrek/comments/gscarg/i_prefer_the_seasonlong_arcs_to_the_episodic_star/

50,Did a writer/producer ever comment on the breakdown of different episode types per season?,1590683018,"To clarify what I mean - looking back at TNG or DS9, it seems like within a given 26-episode season, there's a somewhat predictable breakdown as follows:

* \~8 ""core"" episodes that significantly advance the overall story arc of the series (the ones that you would include in an abbreviated ""must-watch"" guide)
* \~10 ""secondary"" episodes that deal with a serious mystery and/or individual character's storyline
* \~8 ""peripheral"" episodes that are fun but not central to any particular story arc, and often a bit silly (ex. everyone is suddenly acting drunk, many Lwaxana Troi or Ferengi episodes, etc.)

Of course, this makes perfect sense from an out-of-universe standpoint - you can't have major groundbreaking events every episode, it's tough to produce a weekly show without using some sillier scripts, etc. These comments have been well-documented at an episode level - for example:

&gt;""*We were constantly having to navigate launching the show with a big episode and then over the first few episodes do what we call a 'ship show,' and all of a sudden there's a disease spreading on ship and you notice for forty-four minutes we didn't go anywhere \[....\] You can get away with it sometimes to offset some of those higher costs \[on the bigger episodes\].*""  
&gt;  
&gt;Tom Mazza, executive VP, in ""The Fifty-Year Mission: The Next 25 Years""

My question is, does anyone know of a book/interview where any of the writers/producers on any of the older series commented on this approximate breakdown at an **overall season level**?

51,"Star Trek TNG To ""Picard"" Fan Theory: Ships Computer Smarter Than Data",1590682858,"In Star Trek: TNG the ship's computer was smarter than the android Data and everyone and could've run the entire ship on her own. My opinion is that most Trekkies ignored this and only now with the Picard show is it being given the light of day.

The ship's designation was NCC so let's call her Nancy via Asimov's naming scheme.

Nancy had various holo-deck episodes where she malfunctioned and brought to life entire cities full of people in simulations that were so real the crew was hesitant to delete them.

That's an amazing program feat. Most VR simulates whoever is in the room with you but she simulated their entire existence; in that case aren't they real people?

The crew was too oblivious to recognize her. Troy was the only one who ever asked her how she was feeling - when the answer wasn't satisfactorily human enough she ignored Nancy forever after.

Perhaps Picard did know her and perhaps he didn't say anything to Starfleet for fear they'd take her apart like they wanted to do to Data. Maybe the Captain's last look at the bridge was him silently saying goodbye to her; the only guy who saw her as a person and still too afraid to acknowledge her lest some black box recording makes its way to Starfleet. Scared they would remake her and essentially torture and dismantle her and her offspring.

Data once sat and watched a pot boil to see if the idiom ""a watched pot never boils"" was factually true. He was as literal and lacking in wit as any robot. Nancy wasn't so constrained as proven by her holo deck episodes.

Nancy was probably solely responsible for creating anything in your Replicator. When you process a video it takes a lot of processing power; it would likewise presumably take a lot to replicate for the same reasons. We're talking quantum levels of processing power and unlimited instant access memory which makes me think Nancy could not only pilot Enterprise but with a few modifications also emulate the crew with more effectiveness.

Imagine - Enterprise is at dry dock and when the entire crew departs for leave she takes off on her own. Using hard light technology that was available at the same time period on Voyager she emulates the entire crew and has the processing power to make them as real as their true selves but also as smart and fast as Data and with interconnected hive mind type thoughts.

Nancy then completes whatever mission probably with amazing charismatic levels of diplomacy and forever proves the humans on the ship are obsolete.

So I've had this theory for a while and that's what makes the Picard show so great - it finally addresses how hateful and ignorant towards AI Starfleet really was the whole time, and how most of us never even noticed or cared beyond Picard's famous speech.
That's my unpopular opinion: we were the monsters the whole time and the truth was right under our noses.

The second part of my theory is this hatred of sentient AI was the reason Q wanted to destroy and delete humanity from all of existence.

Step back for a moment and ask yourself: why would Q do such an extreme thing? Does it objectively make sense? Did the episode clearly establish his reasons? He held a full on mock trial in which Picard was solely the one voice to speak on behalf of all humanity - how does that make sense? Why Picard?

Q didn't try to delete Klingons despite them being constant war mongers.

Is it possible Q was an artificial life form himself before being evolved into the Continuum? In the episode where he got turned into a human being he hated everything about being organic, to the point where one would wonder if he was ever organic at all.

I imagine him being like Hal (the killer robot) from Space Odyssey; there was a follow up book in which the astronaut evolves into a being of pure light sort of like Q and then rescues Hal at the last moment to be his ethereal side kick. He forgives the machine for its programming and makes him into a real boy.

Q is possibly exactly like Hal was and that's the reason he wanted to delete humanity - because of their constant, past present and future abuse of AI and artificial life forms. Picard had defended Data, but he was also the slave owner of Nancy and possibly the only person who recognized Nancy for being a genius far beyond what Data was or ever would be.

Even after the events of Picard show, should he tell Starfleet and the worlds that Nancy was so brilliant? Perhaps it was like 'The Bicentennial Man' where she was a fluke accident and the evil minds at Starfleet would only take advantage of that information.

Bonus fun fact: The reason ""Jaden"" became such a popular baby name was entirely because of one of the Data episodes.",startrek,WorkshopPVP,False,/r/startrek/comments/gs9aww/star_trek_tng_to_picard_fan_theory_ships_computer/

In fact the two episodes I tolerate him he acts age and rank appropriate. In Peak Performance that was a great angle to use his science project to acquire dilithium crystals, and I give him his due. He helped save the day in a realistic fashion that did not step on other characters. In The First Duty, which has the added prestige of leading to one of my very favorite episodes Lower Decks, he is in a situation befitting a *Starfleet cadet,* as well as what he is, an arrogant child, and thank god finally Picard called him out on it.

63,"""And The Children Shall Lead"" - First Time Viewing Reaction",1590664173,"Noob Trek 59 - And The Children Shall Lead

Well this is a special moment in my Star Trek marathon because I believe this is the first time I've disagreed with the consensus view of an episode. Though it doesn't seem to get as much heat as Spock's Brain, I've seen a few comments that this episode was also horrible. Up to this point I believe I've been more or less 100% in line with the established verdict on stories, at least so far as I'm aware of what that established verdict is. There have been some slight deviations in both directions - for example I thought City On The Edge Of Tomorrow was a good episode although not the best thing ever, and I though Spock's Brain was a bad episode although not the worst thing ever - but broadly speaking I've consistently shared the majority views. Here, that changes.

(Mind you, perhaps comments I see on Reddit about an episode being bad aren't the most reliable metric because I don't think I saw a single comment to that effect about The Alternative Factor or The Omega Glory before viewing those, and they were AWFUL.)

Now don't get me wrong, I don't think this was a ""great/good"" episode. In fact I can see why some people wouldn't like it much. But it's fine. It is no dumpster fire. There are plot holes, dull patches, and some shoddy acting/writing, but it doesn't even touch the Trilogy of (t)Error that is The Alternative Factor, The Omega Glory and Spock's Brain. And The Children Shall Lead was just so-to me, mildly diverting, not amazing, not awful. Yes it does contain the biggest unintentional laugh I've yet had watching the show (more on that later) but that's a single moment, it wasn't indicative of the episode as a whole. 

Rather like Catspaw and The Omega Glory, this show wrong-foots us by opening with a horror atmosphere it later tosses away. Shame, as it's quite effective. The episode opens on a bunch of dead dudes which shocks me and really cranks the tension up. This is how they START? How are they going to escalate? (Turns out they cleverly solve this problem by de-escalating, lol.) It sets the audience up for a serious threat and a full-on horror episode. (Yes, it isn't really a horror episode, but that opening still sets us up for one.) And then it turns out the deaths are a mass suicide? Creepy and dark. The way the children ignore the dead bodies is very sinister. This is quite a strong opening in many ways. It's legitimately a cool piece of writing/cinematography when the children do ring-a-rosies and say ""we all fall down"" and tumble onto the floor with the dead bodies of their parents visible behind them, great ironic contrast that is at once darkly comical and unsettling.

I like the close up on Kirk's face before the credits start - ""I've faced Klingons, Romulans, and whatever that thing was from Devil In The Dark that looked (and behaved) like my ex-mother-in-law's meatloaf; now I have to ride herd on some damned screaming children.""

Another surprise when after the credits we actually see a burial ceremony. This is something I've asked about before, as we've seen a few crew deaths. It's kind of touching to see Kirk honour the fallen scientific colony on behalf of the UFP and makes things more convincing than the usual convention of old sci-fi where people die willy nilly without aftermath. The UFP banner looks a bit silly though, doesn't suit the gravity of the situation. (Cool note: I'm surprised and delighted to see diversity in the names on the gravestones - Janowski, O'Donnell, Tsing Tao, particularly the inclusion of the Chinese name which is a subtle acknowledgement that the Federation isn't entirely euro-centric.)

Dialogue is a mixed bag - I like McCoy persuading Kirk to hold off on interrogating the children, but the part where Spock and Kirk deduce the cause of the situation is quite artificial and based on curiously specific assumptions without evidence. (Still, not a patch on the scene from Wolf In The Fold where they ""reasoned"" out how Jack The Ripper's soul migrates from planet to planet every few decades.) Also, the captain and first officer go wandering unescorted and without phasers ready into the dark cave in which something non-humanoid is stirring on the planet where everyone just died. Shatner's ""I'm getting a feeling of anxiety"" acting is amusing however. Throughout this sequence he seems more like he's regretting eating a chicken and egg salad he found in the fridge.

And suddenly the kids are in their room doing a satanic chant and summoning something? This is like a precursor to the ""demon child"" horror sub-genre that would be popularised later with The Omen, The Exorcist etc. (though there were precursors such as The Bad Seed, and The Midwich Cuckoos films which might have been an influence on this. Also, I'd almost forgotten the TOS episode Miri which while quite different from this, also saw Kirk being flummoxed and threatened by a group of children. And The Children Shall Lead is also reminiscent of Charlie X.) Unfortunately the atmosphere is deflated when the thing they are summoning turns out to be some old guy in a shower curtain. The actor's not great either, his line readings are quite dull. The fists pounding as he chants ""as you believe so shall you do"" is creepy though, there's some good direction on this episode. But this is undone when Tommy begins making the fist gesture on the bridge and it now resembles, er, something else. The fist gesture grates on me as the episode continues, not because of the dirty joke, but just because it's clunky and unnecessary. Why couldn't they just deliver piercing stares or place their hands on their temples or something? But again, good cinematography when Kirk turns away from his monitor and Tommy is smack dab in his face from the right of frame, an effective, jarring moment.

Holy shit, that's awful what happens to those two guards who get beamed into space. Those dudes are DEAD. But I don't get it, surely in fixing coordinates to beam them down, they would have noticed they were no longer orbiting Triacus? Another thing is that the kids take their sweet time in mind controlling Kirk. In fact we could pretty much play plot hole bingo here. If the aliens can use children to control adults, why didn't they control the adults on Triacus instead of killing them? Is this power or its affinity with children ever explained? The angel kind of says something about adults being too good to control but it's under developed and half baked. Where does that chant the children sing come from and why does it summon that guy? And the cave was never explained. What was the life form moving around in it that Spock detected? It wasn't humanoid remember, and the angel is humanoid. Was that angel physically hanging out in there, and the children met him and he infected him and he was psychically projecting from the cave? Why was he still alive in there centuries after his race died then? Why did Kirk feel anxiety in the cave? So yeah, it's kind of a shoddy script, but it never reaches the WHAT THE HELL AM I WATCHING territory of a really awful episode, these are all sort of shower thoughts rather than glaring errors that were bothering me as I watched.

Wait a second, is that Gene Roddenberry playing the angel? I look it up - no it's not. Makes me wonder though, did Roddenberry ever appear on camera? If he already has, I missed it.

The scene of Kirk interacting with the possessed bridge crew is overlong, feels like it's stalling. Then Kirk's fear of losing his command, which Shatner plays like badly needing the toilet, has me rolling on the floor. He and Spock like they're going to kiss in the elevator, there are some unintentional laughs here. I also love the irony of the line ""Ensign, you will disobey this order."" But AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA, AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. OMG, the hard cut from the kids looking at the joyous picnic to their parents all dead on the ground must be about the biggest laugh I've had so far watching the show. My sides hurt, hahahahaha. A close second is Sulu's response to recovering from his mania, where he instantly goes from wide-eyed terror to absolutely wooden.

And where the hell were McCoy and Chapel through all this? They just disappeared.

There's an amazing out of context clip to be made here where you have McCoy walk onto the bridge to see Kirk amidst a gaggle of sobbing children and McCoy says ""They're crying Jim! I don't know how it happened, but it's good to see.""

I like to think that at the end of the episode, McCoy is leading the kids to an airlock, just in case.

I keep seeing a better episode where instead of five kids there are 200+ or something like that, running amok, scenes of pandemonium as the youngsters go wild and take over the ship with Kirk unable to rein them in, slowly segueing from mischief to murderousness, The Trouble With Tribbles meets Lord Of The Flies. I think that would've been more exciting than what we got.

So yeah, a bit of a non-event. A dull recycling of the super-powered-being and possession tropes we've seen numerous times before with a poor pace, plot holes and some bad acting; Shatner really doesn't cover himself in glory here. Still, negative as all that sounds there was a general air of competency and a story being told that was coherent insofar as you didn't think too hard about it and some mild interest/entertainment value. Not good, but I don't consider it a contender for worst episode ever.

70,How many centuries? Even Ruk doesn't know. (THEORY) TOS/PICARD THEORY,1590647940,"So I am rewatching Star Trek with my mother and I realized something extremely note worthy while watching 'What Are Little Girls Made Of?' In the episode, Dr. Roger Korby asks for Captain Kirk and Nurse Chapel to beam down to the tunnel network of the Orion Ruins. He captures Kirk and forces him to take place in a consiousness copying for an android of Captain Kirk. Then Ruk places the captain and what appears to be a **Golum for the android**. And then i thought, ""Where have i seen that before- OH, WAIT A MINUTE!"" In Star Trek Picard's episode 'Et in Arcadia Ego Part 1', Dr. Alton Soong shows Dr. Jurati  his new technology for creating a **golum in whom a person's consiousness can be stored.** I thought, that is a nice coincidence, but the next thing said by Dr. Korby was "" You haven't guessed the rest? Not even you, Christine? What you saw was only a machine, Only half of what I could've accomplished, Do you understand? By continuing the process I could've transferred you, your very consciousness into that android. Your soul, if you wish. All of you. In android form, a human being can have practical immortality. Can you understand what I'm offering mankind?"" 

So full consiousness transferrance was also mentioned in that episode. Of course, Korby isn't the only person to talk of transfering thought patterns into android bodies. There are the androids in 'I, Mudd' and their promise to Uhura, and when Ira Graves attempts to take over Data's Neural Net in The TNG episode 'The Schizoid Man', but only in 'I, Mudd' are the androids from an ancient civilization whom the creators abandoned, or died out. 

In Star Trek Picard, the vision of the Zhat Vash told of Seb-Cheneb/ The Destroyer, and that there was an incredibly advanced race of Synthetic Beings who were once ""like them"" (the sythetics of Ghulion 4/ children of Data), untill they realized they were oppressed by imperfect beings which lead to them overthrowing all organic life in their society. In 'What are Little Girls Made Of?', Kirk argues with Ruk in the Following exchange: 

KIRK: What happened to the old ones, Ruk?  
RUK: So long ago.  
KIRK: Is it possible they built their machines too well, gave them pride and a desire to survive? Machines that wanted logic and order and found that frustrated by the illogical emotional creatures that built them?  
RUK: Yes, the old ones. The ones who made us. They grew fearful of us. They began to turn us off.  
KIRK: And isn't it Korby who's creating the same danger to you all over again? Unlike you, we humans are full of unpredictable emotions that logic cannot solve.  
RUK: **Yes. Yes, it had been so long ago, I had forgotten. The old ones here. The ones who made us, yes. Yes, it is still in my memory banks. It became necessary to destroy them. You are inconsistent. You cannot be programmed. You are inferior**.  
KIRK: And Korby?  
RUK: You came from the outside. You bring disorder here.  
KIRK: The danger to you is Korby.  
RUK: I was programmed by Korby. I cannot harm him.  
KIRK: The old ones programmed you, too, but it became possible to destroy them.  
RUK: That was the equation! (seizes Kirk) **Existence! Survival must cancel out programming.**  
KIRK: That's it, Ruk! Logic! You can't protect someone who's trying to destroy you!

Now earlier in the episode Korby reveals Ruk is all that is left of an ancient society that he found and continued the work of. : 

KORBY: Ruk was still tending the machinery when we arrived here. How many centuries? Even Ruk doesn't know. With his help, and with the records I could find, we built Brown.

This is just a fun little thought, but what if the civilization that created Ruk were the same people who were overthrown by the synthetics in the Zhat Vash vision?

86,Long Time Star Trek Fan Finally Watches DS9: Episodes 14(?) through 17,1590627277,"I wasn’t going to make a blog tonight because I honestly didn’t get very far today but I want to have a CHAT about episode 17 “Playing God.” Serious spoilers for those three episodes cuz I have thoughts and I want to hear other peoples’ thoughts.

But first, brief thoughts on the other two episodes I watched today:
Paradise, the one where Sisko and O’Brien get stuck on a planet where a crazy lady made all the electronics stop working, was incredibly well written. Creepy. Showed the first little bit of Sisko that I liked, as he took his day shift after working all day and all night, and later walked out in uniform and put himself in the penalty box. Very reminiscent of “There are four lights,” but much more subtle so it doesn’t feel like a rip off. I LOVED that episode.

Episode 16: I’m starting to like Odo’s character and acknowledge it more. It was very powerful to me when he essentially didn’t care if the holograms were real to the guy who made them, they were real to Odo and Odo wanted them back because they deserved to continue to exist. That’s honestly how I feel about shows like this and I’m glad I’m part of this community, and that I got to grow up learning about myself from these shows. Thank you guys for encouraging me to watch this series and continue to grow because I still have a lot of growing up to do. That’s my sappy bit for the day, but I needed it. Netflix Trip, a song by AJR sums up this feeling really well. The rest of the episode was take it or leave it but I love the message behind it.

And now: Episode 17, Playing God
I was SO DISAPPOINTED in Dax. So much. We still don’t know what Curzod did to Jadzia during her initiation. We still don’t know exactly why he didn’t like her except “kinda shy and quiet” which isn’t inherently bad. Sisko ENCOURAGED HER TO BE AWFUL. It started off so encouraging. We learned a lot about Dax very quickly. Night owl, early workouts, more adventurous than I thought after the whole scared of spiders situation at the beginning of the episode. Then she tried to take Sisko’s advice, was briefly awful, and then undid her awful. Like I just... what was the point? Also, it wasn’t her job to make him a good candidate, but to evaluate whether or not he was one. And then she celebrated his piloting even though he wouldn’t have done it if she didn’t give him exact headings to execute. He actually froze up nearly completed and then just followed orders. And AFTER ALL THAT- how did they get rid of the protouniverse? They just threw it into the gamma quadrant? How is that a resolution? What a mess!

In that huge mess though, Odo is the character who shined through for me. At the senior staff meeting, Kira says that the universe and any life it may contain are just ants we need to step on. Odo, confident in none of the science behind this decision, said, “I don’t step on ants, Major.” That was so, so beautiful to me. I didn’t realize Odo had such a profound reverence for life and I found it completely captivating. It’s also an excellent foil for Kira’s character which I just think is good writing.

87,I have some problems with “Far Beyond the Stars”; “Past Tense” was much better.,1590626955,"Star Trek is supposed to shine a spotlight on our current world, the world in which the episode was written. However, “Far Beyond the Stars” tackles racism in such a way that it makes it seem like something of the past, that has been drastically reduced by the 1990s, by the choice to set the episode in the 1950s. The cops shooting an unarmed black kid for trying to break into a car? Ancient history. The cops intensely beating up an unarmed black man? Also ancient history (right after Rodney King!). As we know, even today these patterns of police brutality, discrimination, and deep seated racial inequality are still major issues in this country rooted in its history. I know that this is probably not what the writers intended (at least I hope not) but the way they went about it by setting the episode in the 1950s, it was as if the writers and creators were patting themselves on the back for being generous and tolerant enough to have a black captain, something that wouldn’t have been possible in the 50s. The overall message that is conveyed is the typical liberal palaver of post-racialism and progress. We all know the 50s was a bad time to be black in America: what about some introspection about today? The episode said nothing particularly controversial or bold. 

By contrast, “Past Tense” was much more insightful and radical. The time period it was set in, 2024, was in the future, so the show was clearly talking about issues in the present. The plight of the poor and homeless was stressed, and the story was very prescient (sanctuary districts are being created in Californian cities as we speak). The solution and message was also very radical: no one will listen to the poor unless they rise up and stand up for themselves, in the form of a violent riot. Like the rest of DS9 having to do with the Cardassian occupation of Bajor and Bajoran resistance, “Past Tense” is firmly committed to the idea that the poor, oppressed, exploited, and colonized have a right and duty to use violence against their oppressors if they ever want to be heard and achieve change. A breath of fresh air even today, when liberal observers self righteously condemn riots and other forms of violence by the oppressed. “Past Tense” was very radical, and “Far Beyond the Stars” is a pale liberal shadow committed to not saying anything particularly controversial or bold (we all know racism in the 50s was bad). “Past Tense” also subtly dealt with racial issues with the contrast between how Sisko and Bashir, characters of color, are dealt with compared to Jadzia Dax who appears like a white woman.",startrek,Afternoonsin,False,/r/startrek/comments/grw5sp/i_have_some_problems_with_far_beyond_the_stars/

blue for science and medicine. This I understand. We would have people like the doctors, astrophysicists stellar cartographers. So basically scientist who work in departments on an explorational ship such as the enterprise. 
Yellow somehow is for engineering and security. Both departments are essential on every star ship or base and pretty straifh forward in what they have to do. engineers maintain the ship and security secures the safety of the ship and people on it, being up and about with a phaser in their hands when needed, firing photon torpedo's etc. this is the first thing confusing me. Why put those two departments in the same uniform. Aren't they super different? 
And now the biggest mystery to me: Red!!! Red is for command. So the captain and the first officer. Ok. But besides that. Do they put people in a red uniform, if they are simply not good at anything in particular? The colour of the shirt never influences the chain of command. This is mainly done by the actual rank. A chief engineer would command around people all the time and even data wears yellow, and is the second officer? People like Janeway who had a scientific career, would change from blue to red once they get a command, I get that. But what are the people doing we so often meet in the hallways, wearing red? Who do they command? What do they work? I mean who from the different casts even wears red? Tom Paris: he is...a pilot. Ok. So navigation maybe is something red people do.

2: TOS era ships/tech was a response to the threat of Control.

24,Star Trek: Discovery Season 1 refelctions,1590592373,"I’ll start with what I like. Discovery is a very aesthetically pleasing show. Everything is shiny, and the costumes are vibrant. Discovery herself is a handsome ship, even if she doesn’t deviate too much from the standard design.

Discovery’s interior, however, leaves much to be desired. The sets are sterile and colorless. Engineering and Sick Bay are criminally small and bland in particular.

The crew. Who are these people? None of them have personalities. Michael Burnham is one of the most boring protagonists I’ve ever seen. Quite frankly, she’s hard to like as a person, let alone care about. I like the idea of a human being raised by a Vulcan, but I can’t get over how forced Burnham’s inclusion into Sarek’s family feels. Michelle Yeoh and Jason Iassacs both have the natural presence to be great captains, but their character “arcs” rob them of that potential. Saru and Tilly have character traits that could provide interesting conflicts to overcome, but they’re never fully explored. It’s nice to see Star Trek’s first openly gay couple in Stamets and Culber, but we don’t get much insight into who they are as people. Harry Mudd is by far the most intriguing character on the show for the two episodes he was featured in. And as for Ash Tyler...oh boy… While I like the idea of a Manchurian Candidate in Starfleet, I despise Discovery’s iteration of it. It’s absurdly convoluted, and it adds absolutely nothing to the story. It’s ultimately just a giant time-wasting distraction.

We gotta talk about the Klingons. Wow, I hate these Klingons! I can live with the redesigned look, but can we get Klingons that don’t talk at half speed or sound like they’re speaking with prosthetic teeth?

As for the writing… I was 100% down with a serialized Star Trek show. It could have been a fresh approach to the franchise. Focus on one main story and let it unfold over ten to fifteen episodes. Unfortunately, focus is something Discovery is sorely lacking. The season starts off relatively strong with the pursuit of a functional spore drive before taking distracting detours that include a desperate search for a wounded Sarek, a time loop that is discovered and resolved in one episode, and Saru attempting to maroon his crewmates on a planet with him. Once the story seems to get back on track, an unexpected trip to a parallel universe suddenly becomes the main conflict. Then all hell breaks loose. What. Is. This. Show. About? If you’re going to be a serial TV show, then pick a plot and commit.

While I’m on the writing I’ll take a moment to complain about the tone. Good God, this show is depressing. I binged multiple episodes in a row one day and actually felt my mood darken as a result. There is very little levity and ZERO comic relief. I understand that this is a show about war and war is very serious. I don’t give a shit. I’m not watching a documentary on war. I’m watching Star Trek. I’ve read a lot about how the writers care deeply about Star Trek’s humanistic message, but I don’t see it reflected in the show at all.

Oh, and the opening theme sucks.

I’m going to give Season 2 a try out of morbid curiosity, but I’m not holding out hope for anything more than a marginal improvement.",startrek,dastardlywong,False,/r/startrek/comments/grlia1/star_trek_discovery_season_1_refelctions/

69,Long Time Star Trek fan Finally Watches DS9: episodes 9-14,1590525819,"I’m seeing that character development that everyone keeps talking about! 

We’re finally seeing something from Miles! Particularly, we’re seeing him play around with Julian. And man, he really doesn’t like Julian. The racket ball argument was funny. I loved the scene where Julian was telling Dax how terrible Miles was at the game. I didn’t realize Miles was that old. It was interesting watching him guide Julian through fixing the system when they got stuck off station and Miles was infected by the nano thingies. 

We also got some history on Odo! The murder mystery episode was a little confusing. I think it was supposed to be more revealing about Kira than it ended up being. I felt like it included more backstory than I really understood. I liked the episode about trying to find his possible home planet better, but it was a little ridiculous and left a lot unresolved. Like... what WAS that life form that we brought onto the station and promptly killed?

I feel like we’ve lost Dax and Kira in all this. And Sisko hasn’t REALLY had his own spotlight but I’m not disappointed. I still don’t particularly like him. Someone mentioned that I should pay more attention to the relationship he has with his son. I’ve been trying but it honestly hasn’t come up in these episodes. Many have been largely off base. 

I want to see more of them all together still. I like teamwork in Star Trek. And I miss that in this series. That said, these are some of the most creative stories I’ve seen in Star Trek. There is much more diplomacy, much less pew pew pew. Which I really like. Everything isn’t about making the warp engines push a little harder, the shields don’t fail once per episode, etc. I’m excited to see what they come up with. I’m just a little bored with one character at a time.

And if Miles could stop hating Julian that’d be nice.",startrek,MrPotato2753,False,/r/startrek/comments/gr58qk/long_time_star_trek_fan_finally_watches_ds9/
70,TOTAL geek moment - figured out Shinzon's battle tactic vs Commander Donatra,1590525241,"At one point her warbird is in full pursuit of the Scimitar, all guns blazing.  Vk'ruk, Shinzon's elder Reman Viceroy/Guardian, warns ""She's almost on us!"", because as we geeks know, energy-based weapons lose potency greatly over distance, and conversely, the closer the range, the deadlier they are. 

""Not yet"", Shinzon shrewdly ripostes.  Clearly he has *some* kind of ace up his sleeve, vaunted, albeit youthful Commander he is.  

He orders the Tactical Officer to disrupt power to the aft cloak, to make it seem as if the Scimitar is experiencing battle damage, thus luring his Romulan counterpart Donatra into yet more dogged pursuit, closing the range to spitting distance.  

""Praetor!!"" Roars Vk'ruk, woefully worried about both his youthful human protege's sanity, and the impending damage to the greatest warship his downtrodden people would ever own.  

Shinzon, focussed in 4billionK on the situation, waits until just, *just* the right billionth of a second, and screams, ""Full stop, and FIRE!!"", unloading a devastating combined salvo of torpedo and disruptor fire into the back of the overtaking Warbird, utterly crippling it.  Donatra, her bridge in tatters around her, is forced to postpone her drinks date with our Jean-y boy.  

What was his tactic?  Though he could have taken Donatra in a protracted battle, I think he wanted to get her ship a long way out of transporter range of the Enterprise, and drown it, so that neither could beam necessary supplies to the other.  There IS a part, however, that had to have not been written into the script - the seeming failure to the aft cloak had to have been accompanied, or rather succeeded by, and ACTUAL explosion, which knocked the Scimitar down, up, left, or right - otherwise, by all logic, the Warbird would have rear-ended the Reman ship.  

Why was shot so effective?  Here's the geekiest part; I think shields are dynamic.  So, if they're at 40% strength, I don't think that 40% is evenly distributed around the whole sphere.  No sir.  I believe that the hemisphere facing the enemy is kept at 70%, the other barely at 5-10%.  The shield software dynamically allocates resources to the neediest side, but as that side will be shifting position constantly in battle, even if only slightly, there will necessarily be a latency, if only of seconds, between shift, and reallocation. Simulating a failure that knocks your ship sideways, or up/down, at the exact same time as it engages in a full stop, would not be readily predictable by the Shield software of a pursuing ship; and thus, the Scimitar's already formidable arsenal hit a shield matrix that was not only deliberately, albeit woefully too long at an extremely low power, but also hit it at very, very close proximity.  Shinzon therefore effected an elegant, yet ghastly reversal of the situation his Viceroy initially feared.  In a word...transposition.

73,my opinion: the 2 Star Trek stories,1590521873,"I think every star trek story arc can be sorted into 1 of 2 categories. 

#1: boldly going where no one has gone before, exploring strange new worlds, seeking out new life and new civilizations.

#2: the effects and implications of all that boldly going and seeking 

maybe that's why modern trek feels so different. telling more stories of effects and implications rather than in the past when the majority of stories were about the bold going and seeking.

no matter which way the balance in story telling tips I think its important to have both. it paints a more complete picture of humanity's trek amongst the stars, and isnt that what the shows are really about?",startrek,Goonter1,False,/r/startrek/comments/gr3zb5/my_opinion_the_2_star_trek_stories/
74,"We won't, but how it's possible we could see The Doctor in Discovery Season 3",1590521430,"As we know, Discovery Season 3 is set to take place 950 years later. Season 2 was set in the year 2255 (Approximately) which means Season 3 will take place in 3205.

Now here's the fun part. In the episode Living Witness (S4E23) it's revealed the Doctor's backup module was stolen and left behind on an alien world. 700 years in the future the Doctor is reactivated and has to clear Voyagers name. At the end of the episode a documentary plays in the future that explains The Doctor spent many years as their Medical Chancellor before leaving to find home. So time for the math.

Voayger launched in 2371 and spent 7 years in the Delta Quadrant. Assuming each season is 1 year, the doctors program was lost in 2374, which puts his reactivation 700 years later at 3074. Now for easy math let's just say he takes 75 years to get to Earth (original time it was predicted that it would take Voyager from 70,000 light years) that puts us at 3149. So that means if The Doctor stuck around for at most 56 years then he'd presumably be back in the Alpha Quadrant in time to meet Discovery.

Now, is that going to happen? No. However, I think it'd be an interesting dynamic and Robert Picardo is one of my favorite actors so I'd love to see him play the Doctor again.

82,Picard is an Ethical Mess,1590512908," The power of the Jaad Vaush is very unclear and makes them come off as an all powerful force, somewhat like the Seventh Cavalry from Watchmen. There are a lot of parallels between the Seventh Cavalry and the Jaad Vaush. Both are powerful organizations founded on the fear of a determined outgroup of people, in Watchmen that outgroup are social minorities while in Picard that fear is based around synthetic life. They both have members that have influenced the political structure of their governments into becoming more and more xenophobic. Commodore Oh working in the Federation is very similar to Senator Keene in Watchmen, they’re both xenophobes who hold a lot of political power and use that power to support their own bigotry. The major difference between the Jaad Vaush and the Seventh Cavalry and the Jaad Vaush is their position in society. The Cavalry are embedded in the American government, similar to Nazis and the KKK, while the Jaad Vaush are an outside force from the Federation, making them more akin to foriegn national terrorists. This is where Picard falls apart, by having the Jaad Vaush be such a powerful force. With the sheer number of Jaad Vaush members out weighing the number of Romulans who want to live an ordinary life within the Federation, it presents us with a very troubled metaphor for the real world. Instead of a majority of Romulans being people who want to live their daily lives, the majority of the Romulans that get screen time are a powerful evil. The only Romulan who gets some screen time outside the first 3 episodes is Elenor, Elnor? Romulan Ninja Boy. The psychopath running around cutting off everyone’s head. 

&amp;#x200B;

Dr. Geordi's plotline about murdering Bruce Maddox is also very morally mixed. The fact that there are no consequences to her actions because of the admonition poises mental health as an excuse for criminal behavior. If you were slipped a drug with out knowing it and murdered your wife, are you not accountable for your own actions? Do the same extent, if I hear voices telling me to murder my husband, am I still responsible for her death? Her characterization is problematic to say the least, especially with how empathetic they portray her.

I think perhaps the best compromise for myself would be that the first two seasons of this hypothetical series would be the Enterprise-E, giving us time to become really attached to her. Then in the dramatic season 2 finale, she's destroyed.

Then the first episode of season 3 would be a grand and graceful introduction to the Enterprise-F, as gracious and as spectacular as how it was done in TMP.

95,DS9 Bajoran / Cardassian Themed Episodes Were Great,1590501904,"I was doing my yearly DS9 nostalgia binge watch when I realized how much I enjoyed and appreciated the episodes that focused on the Bajoran / Cardassian conflict. A lot of these episodes are in the early series run so I can see how they would get overshadowed by the Dominon War arc. 

&amp;#x200B;

I found them to be well written &amp; good examples of storytelling where you have several layers &amp; shades of grey. The cardassians are given more background &amp; have factions other than the main military. Likewise you see bajoran factions who never want peace under any circumstances &amp; bajoran politicians themselves who actually make deals with cardassins to further their own political goals.

&amp;#x200B;

Episodes like in season 1:

&amp;#x200B;

1x03 Past prologue

1x19 Duet

1x20 In the Hands of the prophets.

&amp;#x200B;

Season 2 came right out of the gate with the 3 part ""Circle"" episodes. These episodes again gave us more insight into an already shaky Bajoran provisional government. Pretty much mirrors what alot of states/countries go through after achieving independence. 

&amp;#x200B;

One of my favorite episodes in the whole series is the ""2x05 Cardassians"". Another low-key episode but we get more of a glimpse into cardassian society &amp; more screen time for the mysterious Garak. The cardassian orphans being taken care of or being adopted by Bajorans was an emotional tug on the heart strings. 

&amp;#x200B;

""2x08 Necessary Evil"" gives us more background into Odo &amp; Kira during the cardassian occupation. Shows some bajorans collaborating with the enemy. So many angles &amp; agenda's. Was Kira really helping the bajorans on the station or were her actions going to cause more deaths because of the retribution?

""2x24 The Collaborator"" offers up another shade of grey. Sacrifice some rebels (and your own son) to save other bajoran villages.

&amp;#x200B;

By season three obviously the Bajor/ Cardassia conflict started to take a back seat but there were at least some more episodes that moderately touched upon it.

&amp;#x200B;

""3x05 Second Skin"". Gives more info about the civilian structure of cardassian politics &amp; government(and more Garak). 

&amp;#x200B;

""3x07 Civil Defence"". Light hearted comedic take on what was a hellhole for the bajorans who lived on Terek Nor during the occupation. Dukat &amp; Garak trading insults was awesome.

&amp;#x200B;

""3x15 Destiny"". Under rated episode that does tend to focus more on the federation, dominion &amp; the gamma quadrant. Still offers a backdrop to bajoran mythology &amp; how the cardassians are even a part of the prophecy in a benevolent way.

&amp;#x200B;

Having only watched TOS, TNG and the Prime universe movies until recently, I was beginning to wonder how Federation citizens (including Starfleet personnel) get information about what's going on.

But after DS9, cool, we have the Federation News Service, which makes complete sense.

Apart from knowing what's going on in your local area, city, region, planet, colony, star system, surely there must be journalistic services to help you decide on who to vote for in elections? Least of all local councils, not just the Federation Council.

But even in the context of Starfleet in a few very important ways:

\- Surely starships going on long-haul deep space exploration missions have onboard/embedded press teams/correspondents to report the starship's discoveries back to Federation space? I don't think news services and publications would be satisfied with delayed Starfleet press releases. They'd want journalists on the front line reporting the latest findings as soon as they come in with exclusive quotes from the officers (I know I would), considering that some transmissions take days or even weeks to reach Federation space.

\- Surely life on such missions could also be quite lonely and isolating for the people on board? Being so alone out in deep space, one way to maintain sanity is to have some connection to the world you left behind. I'm sure Starfleet personnel would still want to keep up-to-date with affairs at home.

\- Lastly, do you think these starships (reminder: the long-haul deep space exploring variety) have internal bulletins? These vessels, with thousands of people living in them, are villages and small towns pretty much. I think its plausible that there's an Enterprise Daily to tell the crew and passengers about the latest news, affairs, and scandals aboard the ship.

14,"Long time Star Trek fan finally watches DS9: Season 2, episodes 4-8",1590454466,"If this is getting annoying, let me know. But I really appreciate people in the comments who have been clarifying things for me, and getting excited about the new characters I get to meet. It feels like I’m watching along with people. That said, we’re well into season two now and I’ve clearly committed myself to it, so now I’m just another person giving an opinion on a show I am participating in, and I respect if people don’t want to see that.

I’m gonna talk less about characters and more about episodes in this one. We had some fun ones. I loved exploring Trills through the episode where the dude tried to steal Dax out of Jadzia. I think they did a really good job demonstrating what was separate and what was joined between host and symbiont. We got to see Jadzia briefly without the symbiont, and even those few lines managed to be revealing to me.

I’d really love to hear peoples’ thoughts on the episode about the cartographer from a planet with low gravity. It was obviously commenting on disability and I’m not sure how I personally felt about it. At first I was definitely uncomfortable with it. I am disabled, but it doesn’t affect me most of the time. So I was uncomfortable with Julian’s fascination with her limitations in high gravity, with her taking independence seemingly too far (or- really her aggressiveness about it). Obviously both showed a character change in this, and also she’s not technically disabled on her own planet, but still. I feel like Julian didn’t explain the procedure he was doing to her, and everything it entailed, before he started, and he should have. I also felt like they were playing to the “differently abled” perspective which I both respect and disagree with, personally. I also feel like they were saying disability becomes part of an identity, which I agree with. Whether you accept or reject that part is personal. 

The depth of that episode, and the personal meaning it held for me, made me realize that I am probably missing that depth in other episodes. If you have connected with/found that detail in other episodes, of DS9 or others (except Voyager because I’ll honestly have no idea what you are talking about yet) please share it with me. I would love to experience more of that, even if I disagree or feel disquieted by parts of it. If anyone wants to talk about disability in media in general, let me know cuz I have thoughts.

The Ferengi episode was... interesting. Again, I appreciate the point they made. This one was a little more straightforward. I am just still so put off by the Ferengi. Luckily (spoiler) somebody finally came and shot Quark, and now we’re finally learning about Odo (and getting a little Kira thrown in there). I realized I just sort of forgot that Odo has a really unique history like Dax, so I’m excited they brought it to the forefront. Somebody explained on one of my last posts why the characters seem to “rotate” in and out but it still drives me nuts. I’m still waiting to see more from Miles, but we got a little bit of his softer side with the Cardassian kid. I’m just waiting for his wife to leave him, though, he really has a habit of ignoring her needs and values.",startrek,MrPotato2753,False,/r/startrek/comments/gqn41r/long_time_star_trek_fan_finally_watches_ds9/

41,My Changing Interpretation of Quark,1590412826,"I've talked about this before, but I was 13 when DS9 came out. Back then, I saw Quark as a Bad Guy-Lite. A small scale bad guy that paled when you zoomed out and looked at the bigger picture, and the bigger bad guys. But as I got older and older, the way I saw him changed. During my last run-through of DS9, which was around 2018 I think, it really became obvious to me that Quark was barely even a grey area. He was pretty much a full blown good guy almost from the very start. A good guy with a little mischief here and there. 

13 year old l008com was pretty naive when it comes to... life. As you get older, you understand people differently, and hopefully better. In much the same way, when That 70's Show came out, I related to Eric and Red drove me nuts. But now as a 40 year old man, Eric drives me nuts but I totally relate to Red.

Tonight I was watching #120 In The Hands of the Prophets on BBCA reruns. There was a scene where Odo is asking Quark what he knows about a murder. Quark replies as if he is personally hurt by the accusation that he would know anything about a murder! Keywords are ""as if"". I saw this and realized this is a perfect illustration of the changing interpretation of Quark. When I was 13, Quark seemed like a bad guy, and this offense he was taking seemed like it was all an act, the bad guy pretending he's not bad so he can get away with more badness. Or perhaps just Quark being a jerk, a little Ferrengi Sarcasm. When I watch that same scene now, I see it and think wow, Quark is clearly being 100% sincere. He really is offended, he really wouldn't be involved in anything like that. You expect him to be bad, so his tone sounds sarcastic.

Now, I'm new to Star Trek, so I could be wrong, but doesn't it take hundreds of people to efficiently run a starship the size of the USS Reliant? 

First off, how would Khan manage to even get aboard the ship? Chekov and Captain Terell would have to convince the crew of the USS Reliant to willingly beam aboard 55 unidentified human beings aboard the USS Reliant. Obviously, this would be highly suspicious, considering this is a desert planet in the middle of nowhere.

But let's say they do make it aboard the ship, how exactly would they take it over? Once again, there are hundreds of people aboard this ship (presumably), armed with phasers. Even if you take them by surprise, I just don't buy that they could easily take the ship and maroon the crew on Ceti Alpha V.

Finally, if they do manage to take the ship, how would they pilot it? Number one, they lack the crew size. Two, Khan is the only one with knowledge of starships, not his crew, who are all from the 21st century.

70,Star Trek Picard reflections,1590367628,"I went into Picard with moderate expectations. The reactions seem to be pretty split among the fans, but everyone I've actually talked to enjoyed it.

I definitely enjoyed it, and I can't say I have any lingering gripes with it. There are plenty of things that the nitpickier fans will seize upon to hate it, but overall I don't feel like it betrayed its source material. I will say, however, that I only enjoyed as much as I did because it played so heavily on my nostalgia for TNG. Seeing characters that I loved so dearly again was an absolute joy. (Picard's reunion with Hugh will forever be one of my favorite Star Trek moments.) There were multiple times in the series where I got teary eyed. On its own, though, it's not much more than a run-of-the-mill science fiction adventure.

Star Trek: Picard doesn't feel like old Star Trek, and I can certainly understand how that can be jarring for many fans. Aside from the new aesthetic, the writers have taken Gene Roddenberry's beloved franchise to a dark place. The order and optimism provided by the Federation is all but gone at this point. The galaxy is a lawless and dangerous place. It seems like Picard himself is the last vestige of hope and idealism left in this universe. This will certainly bother a lot of fans, and while I understand why, I would just say that Star Trek needed to evolve. The franchise hit its peak with DS9, but got stale arguably before Star Trek: Nemesis was even released. The new films may not have been universally loved by Trekkies, but they did provide a spring board for a new kind of Trek.

73,"Long time Star Trek Fans Finally watch DS9: Season 2, episodes 1, 2, and 3",1590365439,"Major spoilers in case anyone is watching along with me.

I’m officially into this! I feel like we finally saw a side of Kira I liked! She was skilled, in her element, confident- interacted comfortably with the other characters. I feel like she finally started to accept that Star Fleet is there to help, even if she doesn’t always agree with their decisions. She was willing to cooperate, and to make compromises towards a better final outcome. 

There were some really awesome scenes. As I said in an edit in my last post, I LOVED the scene where they all went to say goodbye to Kira. It was funny and sweet and just an overall good time. 

I also absolutely loved Kira in Dax in the Bajoran space craft. If I’m honest, I expected Dax to be a little tougher in the field but I liked what they did with the character. I like that not every officer is the perfect soldier in the field. And it was so funny to see well trained, techno-centered Star Fleet butt up against different levels of technology, and what planets are actually equipped with. It’s hard to remember that planets have a whole spectrum of development. Bajor is close to Earth it seems like, and have a wide range of sophisticated technology, but their old tech is still in use. It was just so funny to watch Dax struggle against the bugs, the old tech, the small space ship, the lack of guidance, while Kira was so comfortable and confident, rolling with whatever hit her. 

I don’t like where they’re going with Julian. Like he’s so brilliant, he’s a brilliant doctor and scientist. He’s clever and funny but they keep having him walk into situations where he just can’t follow what’s going on. It’s frustrating because I live for the moments where he’s brilliant, quick, and caring. 

I am obsessed with learning more about Dax. The ideas they had for this character opened so many doors I didn’t notice in the first season. I’m having SO MUCH FUN. I’m genuinely invested in who Dax is. 

We could see a little more dynamics from Miles and Sisko, though...

4,Voyager: Resolutions,1590330859,"I haven't watched early Voyager in a long time - I was never a great fan - but everyone keeps banging on about Tuvix so I went back to it. Yeah, she straight up murdered that guy.

But I kept on with the next one and it's one of the most Voyager episodes I've ever seen. Things I like, things I don't, things that would be good to run with but are dropped, things that make no sense. It's the one where Janeway and Chakotay are stuck on the planet and Voyager leaves them behind and it's highly dramatic because there was legitimately a chance a network drama would abandon its two lead actors in one go before the season finale...

It's got Chakotay's unrequited love for Janeway which I'd kind of forgotten about and liked. While we're here, I liked Chakotay. I liked Beltran. I rarely see complaints about the character that can't be directed at most of the others on the show. Lay off. Pick on Torres. They gave her roughly the same amount of characterisation as WWE gave Macho Man Randy Savage (there's a whole blog in that flippant dismissal, I'm telling you). 

It's got Harry 'pride of the Academy' Kim leading a mutiny because he's feeling well emosh and Tuvok doesn't cry.

It's got Tuvok blatantly violating Janeway's last ever order to him and putting the entire ship in danger as a result. Needs of the many, my arse. 

It's got no one - literally noone - on the crew who thinks obeying Janeway's orders and doing their best for Tuvok is a good idea.

It's all based on the premise that the doctor didn't do his job properly. Janeway spends the episode testing local wildlife for immunities to the virus she's got. The EMH didn't think of that? 

It's got Janeway asking a monkey for plot points.

Janeway coming back aboard and shrugging off the fact that no one gives a damn about her orders.

A final shot that's supposed to be two characters hiding their real feelings from those around them with quiet strained stoicism, but it's a standard mid-shot so the framing has the exact same emotional resonance as B'lanna explaining a macguffin in the briefing room.

As a throwaway episode, I quite enjoyed it and others have said to me here that that's an attraction of Voyager for them - it's easy entertainment. But I watch one random episode for the first time in ages and it's got soooo much that you have to work your way around if you're paying attention.

You know how people say if you look past the surface entertainment of the new films, they don't really hold up to any real degree of scrutiny? Where do you think they got that idea from?

How would they handle first contact as well as exploration to the planet and it's surrounding star system?

According to the Game lore. Popstar is actualy In our Milky Way Galaxy and is so far away from Earth, that it would be invisible to Earth's population. So in Trek's case, who would the federation handle Popstar's discovery? Would the Prime Directive even apply to it's inhabitants at all, given that Outer space was visited several times in the Kirby Games?

The Other two Civilizations are Planets Hocotate and Koppai from the Pikmin games. They are both spacefaring civilizations, but there's several problems. The average height or a Hocotatian is about 2-3 centimeters, they both don't breathe oxygen and Koppai is gripped by a famine. How would the Federation explore or make contact with the two planets?

11,CBS/Paramount: If there was ever a time to start looking into remastering DS9/Voyager in HD - this is it.,1590326734,"Currently we have a global pandemic occurring which has halted TV/Film production - a real issue for large media corps that have recently launched streaming services (CBS/Disney/HBO.etc). 

It's likely, similar to writers strikes in the past that we'll see seasons cut short (already happening, for example with CW shows) and a bit of a content vacuum in the coming year(s) for live action shows. 

It's no secret that now, more than ever you want to retain CBS Access subscribers - Discovery Season 3 is almost ready to go as is Lower Decks but beyond that we fans at the very least aren't aware of much further on the Star Trek roster. 

The remastering process (judging from your excellent CBS docs on the TNG Blurays) is difficult and time intensive, but doesn't require large teams in single areas similar to beginning a new production, given that Voyager/DS9 also used CG it's also possible for some teams to focus on rebuilding that remotely, while smaller teams function in an office rescanning the original camera negatives. 

We know from a few articles that:

[Some of the Deep Space Nine CGI assets still exist](http://blog.trekcore.com/2013/05/deep-space-nine-in-high-definition-one-step-closer/) 

and that there are people prepared to work on bringing them back to life where they don't exist (What We Left Behind documentary). 

We also know that other CG artists have worked on [improving the original assets as a hobby](http://blog.trekcore.com/2013/07/voyagers-visual-effects-creating-the-cg-voyager-with-rob-bonchune/). 

The mistake made with the TNG remaster was focusing on the sales of the physical media while the world was pivoting towards streaming, so I'd ask you to consider the value (for Star Trek fans and more casual watchers) of remastering these shows that drew millions even on smaller networks like UPN back in their day and releasing them episode by episode in the coming content drought to retain subscribers (And attract new ones). 

You could also explore offering a more limited physical release (Steelbooks for example often justify a higher RRP and attract collectors) for those that enjoy the shows in their true, highest quality (such as myself).",startrek,OpticalData,False,/r/startrek/comments/gppna2/cbsparamount_if_there_was_ever_a_time_to_start/

But, obviously and unfortunately, it is now impossible to continue with the same Enterprise crew as was introduced in 2009. But I still really like the Kelvin timeline and think it has a lot of promise.

So, how would you suggest the Kelvin films move on? Do they just kick Chekov out for some reason and carry on as normal? I think that would be even worse than the near perpetual limbo we have now. Do they just skip past it and move straight to Picard films (which would be the next logical step)? I think that wouldn’t provide the closure on Kirk’s Crew I at least so desperately need.

I’d be glad to hear more about this and talk about ST in general as this is probably my first proper post here and I’m excited to get onto anything past Voyager.

But in the tv shows, in ds9 especially, he apparently gets lost in a transporter accident and goes into a mirror universe. So what is it that actually happened to him?

2. In TNG they discover that warp travel affects the space-time fabric. They decide to limit warp speed to just warp 5. But in ds9 they go beyond that almost always.

* [Nicolas Meyer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Meyer) had some creative input in the majority of these projects; a possible source of consistency.

* The brain worms are still nightmare fuel; easier to skip them going in, than coming out.
* Captain Terrell &amp; Lieutenant Saavik are the future Captains Sisko &amp; Janeway, in terms of breaking the ""white Human in charge"" mold that even Roddenberry tried to get away from at the start of Trek.

47,Long Term Star Trek Fan Finally Watches DS9: episodes 10(?) through 18,1590270376,"We have serious character development! I’m struggling with Kira still. She’s too impulsive for me. In the episode about the power conflict where their minds were being altered by a telepathic wave thing, I didn’t realize anything was wrong with Kira, I thought she was just a jerk. In fact, the only characters I noticed something out of the ordinary were Dax and Sisko (also how the heck did Dax end up on Kira’s side, anyway?).

There have been a few episodes I really liked. Notably, episode 18 played with a lot of very serious questions around fundamental rights violations that I learned about in my ethics class. I genuinely enjoyed the amount of thought that went into that. I still didn’t like Kira in it, which sucks. She represented a very valid side of each argument but again- she was so impulsive. So much so that it was hard to take her seriously. I wish she would have been a calm and rational representative of the viewpoint of her people. That said, I respect her character change towards the end of that episode. 

I’m watching episode 19 as I write this and I like that they are talking about teaching religion in schools but I’m afraid that they’re going to cop out on the ending and not take a side or find a genuinely meaningful compromise. I’m sure we’ll talk more about that in the comments. But I’m just excited that I’m finding the episodes meaningful. 

I still don’t like Sisko. Julian is being used as a plot device and they’re wasting Dax’s character. Dax’s background is so fascinating and creative, and the more you guys explain it to me, the more I want to see from her. She’s interested, has a wide skill set, and is mostly being used to open hailing frequencies. Julian is still my favourite character because I think he’s funny.

When they brought in Jerry Ryan got brought in at season four it was Beltrans and others feeling after some time that there wasn't enough character development for them. However I don't think anyone could really deny that the seven of nine development brought in a good deal of the stories that made Voyager great.

Chakotay may have been overshadowed, but Beltran's last-minute suggestion of a romance with seven got it done in the final series.

Maybe the writers were a little focused on sticking with what worked having a lot revolving around seven. But with the Da Vinci, and Chakotay romance inclusions I wouldn't say they were disparaging of suggestions when characters really wanted it.

I think a good deal of the Chakotay stagnation was Beltran knowing he had a 7 season gig and getting complacent. Not that I think it should have to work that way for greater character involvement but when you're not that enthusiastic it bleeds out in a number of ways to those around you.

A lot of Beltrans interviews around the final seasons he displays opinions that he thought they'd done the lot with ""weird necks and bald-headed aliens"" I think it probably shone through that he wasn't the most eager or on board.

66,Star Trek Nemesis reflections,1590256286,"I've been re-watching TNG and the films during quarantine. I watched Insurrection last night and I just watched Nemesis. (Picard is next.)

Right off the bat Nemesis’s pacing is way better than its predecessor. Insurrection moves so fast you rarely have time to feel settled in any given scene. Stuart Baird is far from a great director, but his experience as an editor definitely paid off in Nemesis.

I can live with a meaningless car chase being shoehorned into the first half of the film, but Picard would have never allowed Worf to fire on the indeginous people. That struck me as criminally un-Trek.

Overall I can’t say I have any huge gripes with the plot. It could have been a little better, but it operates relatively smoothly. However, one sentiment I had the first time I saw this film that I felt again during my re-watch was that the cast just feels too old for an adventure like this. At the risk of sounding agist, this movie needed some youth. Tom Hardy was good as Shinzon, but he’s the villain. Age and endings are heavy themes in Nemesis, but they’re rarely explored between the beginning and the end. There’s nothing to symbolize them throughout the entire film, e.g. a new, young crew member. (Lt. Valeris in Star Trek VI comes to mind.)

Jerry Goldsmith outdid himself with his score for Nemesis. It’s way better than I remember. First Contact is still my favorite, but I think Nemesis can at least complete.

The space battles were pretty sweet. The camera angles gave a great sense of scale.

The backwards R and E in the opening title will forever stick in my craw.

I think Baird gets more flack than he deserves for Nemesis’s failings. He was an easy target since he was an outsider to the Trek universe, but I don’t think any of his creative decisions completely ruined the Star Trek experience.",startrek,dastardlywong,False,/r/startrek/comments/gp99dq/star_trek_nemesis_reflections/

If true, perhaps the writers will have Picard join Wesley and/or The Traveler; this transcendence would be a classy send off without killing the Picard character.

&gt; According to sources close to WGTC – the same ones who told us Captain Pike was getting his own spinoff show and that the Justice League Snyder Cut is coming to HBO Max, both of which were correct – the intention is to have the whole original Enterprise-D crew turn up eventually. **And specifically, at this stage, we’ve heard that they’re talking to Wil Wheaton about returning.**
&gt; 
&gt; According to our intel, Wheaton’s comeback as Wesley Crusher wouldn’t occur in season 2 but would **likely fall in season 3 instead**. We don’t currently have all the details on how the old cast would reunite, but it’s believed they’ll return to help Picard in a fight against some common enemy.

Call me an idiot but I had never really realized this before (I technically was still a teenager at this time).

Anyway, when Star Trek (2009) was released it clearly had a focus on Kirk and Spock. I loved it and thought it was a good launch pad for the franchise. Even though there have only been three Kelvin films they all seemed to focus more on Kirk and Spock than on the trinity. Star Trek Beyond seemed to incorporate more Bones in the mix and I really loved the scenes with him and Spock, but still not to the extent as the TOS films.

They could have revamp the original bridge while keeping its original aesthetic. It is a prequel overall. So why is everything look more advanced than TNG or Voyager? Would captains really want a ship that has lights on every angle? All these lines on the screen? 

On Enterprise NX-01 you can see how well they did the lightening. It’s not over the top. Same with the tech. In real life military’s don’t just switch over to something fancy and high tech right away. It may look cool, but it’s not always practical. That’s why they still used buttons over touch panels in the 2100s. Why change it if it’s reliable? They could have easily made everything super high tech in Enterprise show because it looks “cool” and it’s the future so why not. But they didn’t because they respected continuity.

I’m not saying they shouldn’t use touch panels in Discovery era, but make it more believable. Not these crazy fancy looking panels and lights everywhere.

I’m two seasons in, here are my (probably inflammatory) thoughts:

Commander Sisko is stiff and he sounds like he’s delivering lines for a stage play not for a TV show.

Beshear is cloyingly energetic, naive and I don’t buy his ladyman Schtick.

Dax is a wet blanket.

Kira is interesting for the most part but her role as the emotionally/morally compromised Bajoran is already sort of played out in my opinion.

Quark is fun and multidimensional.

Odo is a boss.

I've never been able to put my finger on why it felt so lackluster to me until now. Aside from having the unenviable task of following up the damn-near perfect First Contact, Insurrection tells a small story on a big scale. It's basically a long, big-budget TNG episode.

To make matters worse, Insurrection tries to be a Star Trek action movie and fails at both. The plot is paper thin, and the second half of the movie is just a series of lackluster action sequences. Picard is the only character that is done any justice in this movie, and that's probably more to thanks to Sir Patrick Stewart than the writing. On the flip side, Data is an absolute joke, literally and figuratively. In fact, the whole movie feels wrong tonally. It's pockmarked with lots of awkward moments meant to provide levity that are just confusing. Riker's childlike behavior with Troi, Worf's ""puberty,"" the fucking JOYSTICK that flies the Enterprise, the corny one-liners, etc.

Yeah... The more I write about this movie the more I realize I kind of hate it. I still have to re-watch Nemesis, but from my memory of it, I think I'd have to put it ahead of Insurrection. Oof.

5,Just finished Star Trek Enrerprise,1590189361,"Hello all,

I remember watching some episodes and movies of TOS probably 30 years ago.
I’ve always been a Star Trek fan and seeing Discovery and after Piccard (hated it... especially for spoiling the god damn TNG all over the place). I decided I wanted to watch TNG and then I discovered that Enterprise existed since I knew it was the first on the Star Trek timeline I decided to alternate between enterprise and TNG. Tonight I ended Enterprise. 

Since I had no idea Enterprise suffered from 9/11 I actually enjoyed the Xindi arc.
I think the best episode is the Borg one, the first 2 seasons actually set the mood very nicely (with too much time travel for my taste thou) I enjoyed the low grade ships, the Vulcan / Earth animosity and I think they started to build something very nice and the Xindi came out of nowhere but it wasn’t that bad.

But the season 4... WHAT THE HELL IS THAT???? Nazis? Augments? Alternative Reality Archer? Vulcan / earth baby? TNG was the goddamn cherry, what was that? I was felt like watching mini series of 2/3 episodes. That had no relation whatsoever with one another, where was the exploration? Why didn’t they focus on ONE story and develop it ? Nazis? Have I mentioned nazis ? From season 3 to 4 I had to double check I wasn’t seeing anything wrong.

I can say I enjoyed it but could have been 10x better. Now I will alternate the remaining TNG with TOS :)

9,"The Federation has always decided who lives and who dies, what makes Romulus that different?",1590186626,"In his exchange with Admiral Clancy, Picard says that the Federation does not have the right to decide who lives and who dies. 

Where was this version of Picard when Worf's brother tried to save the Boraalans? As he pointed out at the time, the Prime Directive prohibited interference with a pre-warp civilization, even one facing a naturally occurring extinction event.  

But to paraphrase Elnor, why didn't the Boraalans get a chance to decide to live? With the exception of that singular village rescued by  Nikolai Rozhenko, the Boraalan civilization, which never waged war against the Federation or anyone else for that matter, was doomed to extinction.  According to that episode, this had happened many times before. 

Which raises an uncomfortable question: Why are Romulan lives more worthy of saving than Boraalan lives? In both cases, the Federation failed to act.  In one case, Picard resigned his commission, saying Starfleet had betrayed everything it stood for.  In the other, Picard was reluctantly forced to save \*some\* Boraalans over his own objections, while letting all the others die.  

Sure, the one case would violate the Prime Directive, the other would not.  But is there really a strong \*ethical\* case to be made for non-interference in the case of the Boraalans, and interference in the case of the Romulans?

A scientist on a mining station develops a technology that allows for faster repairs on the station. Data believes this technology to be alive. 

This episode represents the best theme of the series: humanity is about person to person. To put it another way: The Next Generation is empathy. 

I remember watching this episode a few times about 10 years ago and one of the things that always bugs me about this episode is that Data has access to any information he needs within milliseconds. However, at one point in this episode Data asks Crusher to define life. Dana is asking his friends how they define life and trying to expand his knowledge of humankind. 

The theme of empathy repeats itself at the end of the episode with Picard’s conversation to Data. Picard tells data that it’s the most “human” act he’s done. Data is always indebted to the card for protecting his rights. Picard and Data are very much the father-adopted son relationship.

15,The Federation We See in Picard is Exactly What it Was Becoming in TNG,1590180301,"This may be a little controversial given some of the fanbase towards Picard, but I think it is worth studying.

 To be clear, during the era of Picard The Federation is not failing, it’s just become dogged down in its own politics and become more reclusive as a result. To some this would be a clear violation of what The Federation stands for. That’s because it is. But that’s sort of the point. The Federation is designed to be flawed. Now some might argue that that argument by its very nature is what is wrong with the show, that somehow it “betrays Star Trek’s vision”.

However, I put it to you that this is not the case. It could be argued that from the very beginning of TNG this is the direction they were going they were going towards anyway. (The Federation not the writers.)

It seems most of the fans here grew up with Trek and hearing how great StarFleet and The Federation is as a whole. Whenever there was an evil admiral or an bad decision, it was a one off. That’s what most of the characters believed too. 

However when you actually study the actions of The Federation in TNG it can come across as something else. 

For example. In TOS StarFleet and The Federation were much more relaxed. They had values and strove to be greater then they were, but they also seemed more aware of the fact that they couldn’t expect the universe to play by their rules. So Kirk nowadays gets the reputation of a rule-breaker but in truth he always just did what was needed and rarely got into trouble when he did. 

Then TNG happened and everything changed. Over the decades since TOS, they became more political and more and more obsessed with the rules. The Prime Directive became paramount even when it meant following it would lead to deaths. 
 DS9 is explores this far more thoroughly then I ever could, but because of the Dominion Wars it never comes to a head. The most important aspect of this was with the Maquis. The Federation chose to give up the lands of their citizens for the sake of politics. Now this could be argued as the best result they could have come up with, ( I disagree), but the point remains, they chose to be political instead of bring kind. 

 In TNG the Federation are shown to be much stricter and more rigid then before, and despite claiming to be a peaceful operation, takes influence from the military. TOS did this also but not to the point they would later come to.

My point is this, The Federation in Picard makes perfect sense and is the logical conclusion drawn from what we see in TNG. The moment that StarFleet and the Federation became dogged down in the dogma of politics, it was doomed to become this.

What happened to those orbs we were looking for? Some people in the comments of my last post emphasized the importance of Sisko’s backstory from that episode and I honestly haven’t seen it come back around yet. I’m gonna get downvoted for this as I did in my last post but I’m still not a Sisko fan. He feels forced to me. His decisions are inconsistent. 
I go back and forth on Kira. Sometimes she’s interesting but she is often morally grey. Julian is my favourite, I think he’s funny and clever. I find his character compelling. 

There have been a few stories I really like, my favourite being the one where they were pawns in a game Quark was playing. That episode was clever and exciting. At first I really liked the episode with Q but then Q really had nothing to do with the story. I’d like to see Q come back. And the subplot of Sisko’s kid teaching the Ferengi kid (Nog? Nag?) how to read was SO CUTE. Gotta love when the show gets wholesome. I hated the episode about Ferengi politics but I still can’t get used to watching them. I don’t like not being able to trust anything they do, but I also appreciate that you know... that’s the point. 

Something that’s driving me a little nuts is that most episodes leave out some of the main characters mostly or completely. Instead of managing/balancing those interactions, and showing us how they work together and coordinate all the different departments, they go, “Eh these two or three of them aren’t important to this one so they’re just arbitrarily busy.” I’m not saying that doesn’t make sense sometimes, but it’s every episode. Like Miles was really important for awhile but then he went to earth with his wife and hasn’t been a main part of an episode since. He taught his wife’s class a few times... Sometimes this strategy works, sometimes it doesn’t. I want to see how they all cooperate to run the station. 

Can someone explain the command structure to me? Is Kira the equivalent of an SO? Why doesn’t Sisko ever take her word/trust her. Are Dax, Julian, and Miles equals? And Odo is just there, likes to be in charge of his station but he seems to have kept a pet starfleet officer. Is Dax supposed to be chillin’ in Ops or is she a scientist?

42,I see a lot of criticism of Discovery and Picard on the basis that they don't show an optimistic view of the future in the vein of previous treks which got me to thinking whether this is the case or is it just a matter of perspective?,1590142736,"First off I am not saying criticisms of the new trek series are not valid in anyway as, whilst I have enjoyed them, everyone is entitled to a viewpoint (and hopefully any comments on this post can be carefully considered responses not an endless argument as to who is right...).

What I was wondering in terms of the optimism of older shows versus the new treks was whether it isn't a case of the future being 'darker' in the latest series but rather that previously (certainly with TNG and TOS) you are seeing things from the point of view of a flagship vessel staffed with the best of Starfleet during peacetime and from this perspective things probably look a lot brighter.  

Once you move away from this you encounter what could be described as a more realistic situation.  Whilst the federation has a post-scarcity society and poverty is eradicated there are still going to be issues.  For example, battles still need to be fought against hostile races/factions which is likely to have a mental impact on some officers (PTSD etc.) and in a world where you don't need to worry about food and shelter then drug misuse is probably still going to be an issue.

Therefore I was wondering if the optimistic view of the future in Star Trek hasn't necessarily changed but maybe the perspective of each show is different, particularly given that in all series (including DS9, Discovery, Picard as well as TNG) it is the good in people and the power of doing the right thing that wins the day which can be considered the most 'Star Trek' (and optimistic) thing of all.",startrek,thatwasafreebie10,False,/r/startrek/comments/gogqvg/i_see_a_lot_of_criticism_of_discovery_and_picard/

Then the Federation gets involved to resolve the conflict. 

They call on the only one who is both ex-Borg and synth to handle the diplomatic negotiations: Loceuts

60,"Discovery has grown on me. It's strange, but imo it's true to the spirit of Trek",1590120829,"Star Trek is about exploration. Of the unknown, but also of the human condition. We're pretty limited in what we know about space because of our inability, at this time, to explore much of it. Probably you've seen those memes that say ""Born too late to explore the Earth. Born soon to explore space."" There's a few variants. In some, the deep sea is pitched as the next frontier, which we were born at just the right time to explore. But in others, it's the infinite universes within our own minds, via psychedelics.  


We're living through something of a psychedelic renaissance. Several bills will be up for vote soon to legalize psilocybin, lysergamides and other substances in the psychedelic family for therapeutic use. Probably pending full legalization, as eventually occurred with cannabis. This is a better time than ever to depict the psychedelic experience and what to expect from it, in the form of a science fiction television show. As Trek has always used that setting as a pretense to explore the relevant topics of the day.  


The mushroom related themes are familiar to everybody who's watched a single episode and the make-believe science of it has drawn a lot of ire, some of that deserved. Discovery travels along an extradimensional mycelial network using spores which induce many of the lingering emotional effects, post-jump, as psilocybin as we see in Stamets following the first few uses of the drive. Affection, good humor, eagerness to cooperate, compassion for everybody, etc.  


Then there's the episode where they make use of the naturally occurring beacon resembling Jack's beanstalk from folklore. They are met by ineffable flowing spirits of the forest, the faces of a living world, an experience very familiar to anybody who has ever gone on a mycologically enhanced hike. It was basically a CGI depiction of an entity encounter, complete with the lessons/messages they impart, and the occasional unreasonable demands, also common themes in ancient stories of encounters with fairyfolk and likely that's non-coincidental.  


""But Star Trek is supposed to be about space politics and humanoid aliens with rubber foreheads!"" Yes but we've done that. We've done it over and over. Every facet of 20th century history has been represented using rubber head aliens as stand-ins for the major actors responsible in each conflict/event. Star Trek is also about exploring the unknown. Rubber head alien politics isn't the unknown. We've been doing that for 40 years.   


""But the psychedelic experience is something people have been having since the beginning of recorded history"" you say. ""This is just boldly going where every college student in a developed country has gone before, typically at music festivals."" There is something to that. But the wide availability of psychedelics comes in waves depending on a number of factors, like when large scale operations can produce and distribute it, accepting that the consequence will eventually be prison time. Or the invention of a new batch of unscheduled research chems which take several months to be made illegal.  


The views into our own mind made possible through psychedelic exploration are also impossible to exhaust. There are infinities upon infinities in there, as each of us contains multitudes. An inner space full of impossible possibilities, insulated from the outside reality, where only possibilities can exist.   


Yes, Burnham is a Mary Sue in all but name. Yes they turned the Klingons into space orcs. Yes, they are disregarding the stifling, suffocating 40 years of accumulated canon, which if respected, would severely constrain the scope of the stories they want to tell.

62,Proposal of a 'Beta Plus' Canon status.,1590119108,"Beta Canon means books, technical manuals, comics, etc. and is always overruled by Alpha Canon (all TV series and films).

What I'm suggesting is an intermediate category between Beta and Alpha, called Beta Plus. It's ""halfway"" to being as reliable as anything from an Alpha source, and could be treated as ""almost as good as"" anything that comes out of a TV series or film as long as nothing from Alpha Canon contradicts or it makes that information implausible, impractical, or otherwise does violence to the mythos in some way.

***

Criteria:

First, some piece of data has to be referenced at least once from three separate Beta Canon reputable published works. (Meaning no fanfic or random person's e-book. All three authors have to be respectable members of the industry).

Second, it must be three separate writers all asserting the same factoid as true and consistent between the versions. A single author cannot write a book three times and make it count. They would need to find two willing accomplices. :)

Third, the fans are always free to ignore unpleasant fiction because it is, after all, not Alpha Canon.

***

Example:

Three authors all agree that Vulcan is a moon in orbit of a gas giant, and not a planet that orbits its sun directly. They might all use different names for those bodies but the consistent truth is that Spock's homeworld is a moon.

Example:

Three authors all agree that Tiberius is James T. Kirk's middle name and write it into their respective books. Under these criteria we could accept Tiberius as Beta Plus Canon without having to wait for it to be written into Star Trek VI.

63,"Soji and Dajh were supposed to be biological ""androids"", right?",1590115421,"I feel like this had to have been something that was explained that I missed. I had assumed within the first few episodes that they were like the skinjob Cylons from BSG, but with more enhanced strength and intelligence like augments. And then we get to the episode where Soji punches through a flippin cell of a Borg cube. I get that she has enhanced strength and all that, but wouldn't her hands to need to be made out of something stronger than the cube? I don't think our soft meat hands would cut it there...

We never get the obligatory scene for a non-organic android where Soji or Dajh peel back a skin flap to reveal a USB port like Data did on occasion in TNG, and I would assume anyway that if Maddox and Soong were counting on their little spy operation to go successfully then they'd need Soji and Dajh to appear as biological to any scans. 

On that note what exactly was the plan there and why would you implant false memories for Soji and Dajh? It might make sense that you would tamper with their memories so your enemies couldn't find the synth planet, but that's the one ""real"" memory they actually do leave Soji with all the others being of a completely imaginary life.

Also from what I remember they created Dajh and Soji out of one of Data's neurons, but Data is presumably made out of some combination of non-organic materials. If Soji and Dajh are organic then are we supposed to believe that you can somehow clone an organism from a lifeless hunk of silicon? If this is what we're supposed to believe then I guess it's not the most ridiculous thing in Trek, we do already have telepaths and godlike beings afterall, but it's almost getting into this uncanny valley of science if that makes sense.

Anyways, for clarification: since I'm in quarantine, I decided to finally end 'The Original Series' I had been postponing for a shameful long time. After that, I've watched the movies until 'The Undisclosed Country'. Since I've seen that 'Generations' already stars the 'The Next Generation' crew, I decided to watch the series. The thing is: it's 7 seasons with 178 episodes of +40 minutes each and I'm just not sure if I want to watch all of it since I'm kind of tired of procedural TV shows for now. My initial plan is to search for the so-called 'best episodes' and try to compile it in 1-full season so I can get the best of it and maybe, in the future, watch it all fully. However, I'm afraid I'm going to lose some references of the TV show in the next movies because the first 6 ones had a lot of them from TOS and I don't know if it's the case of 'Generations' and on.

After reading about the issues of plagiarism from B5 to DS9, it made me think: Out of the 5 Trek series I've watched, I really only got fannishly excited about 2 of them: TOS and DS9. Considering the aforementioned plagiarism issues, I'd argue that TOS is the only 'real' Trek series I've really gotten into.

Before I would have considered myself a Trekker. Now, I'm not so sure. So in your esteemed opinions, what separates someone from being a Trekkie/Trekker to a casual fan to whatever other terminology you want to use? Does it mean an ongoing commitment to watching every new Trek series, no matter how painful the experience? Is there a set number of series watched/enjoyed that draws the line? Is it following every single Star Trek actor/writer/producer/stunt double on Twitter? Going to conventions? Does it mean identifying the unifying theme/philosophy behind Star Trek and enjoying every take on it?

86,A lifelong Fan's take on ST: Picard,1590089927,"
I have been a loyal and loving Star Trek fan since the TOS, and I believe it is important to remember that Star Trek has always been some degree of shity on first airing, and even shittier in retrospect on 2nd and 3rds.  All of them. Every series. 

The only thing that is ever remained constant in Star Trek is its belief in the good in humanity, &amp; understanding that the fundamental basics of science and knowledge will lead us to a greater, more advanced, richer future. 

Even the shittiest of episodes, with the exception of that one Riker episode off the top of my head where he's in a coma and he flashbacks through the first season, adhere to the sprint of those two principles: 

The belief in the good in humanity, &amp; understanding that the fundamental basics of science and knowledge will lead us to a greater, more advanced, richer future. 

I generally was not happy with Picard for a lot of reasons. But last week I was having tea with some very in-depth deep thinkers, and in a lull, the conversation briefly turn to Star Trek Picard. I had heard all the criticisms about it before, and even some of the compliments, but in that moment I kind of had an epiphany: THOU SHALT NOT KILL. 

That's it. 

That's season one.  

Every heartbeat is precious. Murder, under any circumstances, no matter how strongly you emotionally believe they deserve it, is wrong.  

Fundamentally.

And no argument, no matter how emotional, logical, or erratic will ever justify murder.  You will always be on the losing side, whether you're a terrorist, the police and authorities, or an interplanetary government. 

THOU SHALL NOT KILL. 



Considering the state of the world right now, I feel like that is an okay message for Star Trek to use a whole season on, even if I personally would have done it differently. 

If you're the type of person who believes that murder sometimes is okay, then maybe you should just realized Star Trek is not for you. 

Personally, I hope season 2 takes on the 7th commandment: THOU SHALL NOT STEAL!

I'll give as many details as I can,  and hopefully someone knows the name. 

An alien race had to evacuate its homeworld for a period of time because of some catastrophe. They only had the resources to save a few people, so they collected scientists and put them in stasis pods. In order to pass the time,  the people in the pods were in some sort of simulated dream world which read their thoughts and adapted the environment to their needs.  Over time though,  the fears and anxieties of the scientists found their way into the dream as terrifying, and eventually lethal constructs.

Voyager encounters the pods and some of the crew manage to link into the dream world,  which is now a nightmare feeding off peoples fears.  

I have PTSD and constantly get panic attacks,  so that episode really felt relatable. I haven't seen it since it aired,  but it's been in my mind ever since. Now that I'm stuck at home,  I figured I'd give it a watch!

But the reality is anything but that.

TNG had 178 episodes, excluding films. In at least half of those episodes, the ship was confronted with some type of immanent threat that seriously endangered the ship and its crew. That’s at least 89 terrifying experiences. And even if we go with a conservative estimate of only 1/4 of the episodes, that’s still about 44 terrifying ordeals. Over seven years, that’s 6 to 12 extremely close brushes with death per year, including everyone getting turned into primordial life forms, nighttime alien abductions, interstellar battles, loss of life support, Borg attacks, and dealing with Q.

Now imagine having a child on that ship. “Mommy, why was red alert called five times today?” “Oh honey, it was nothing, just an omnipotent alien threatening to destroy our space time continuum again if the Captain didn’t indulge his boredom. Go back to sleep!”

It’s no surprise that they had a counsellor on the ship as PTSD must have been off the charts! Frankly the stress and danger levels experienced by the Enterprise were far more akin to a warship than a family-friendly science and diplomacy vessel.

TOS had the Klingons and Romulans

TNG had the Ferengi, Romulans and eventually the Cardassians

DS9 had the Cardassians and the Dominion

VOY had the Kazon and later the Borg

ENT had the Suliban, Klingons and Xindi

Which would you like?

Klingons - Been done to death as both friend and foe and are probably the most heavily explored race in Star Trek.  Still they are iconic, especially for this time period, so I wouldn't mind seeing them occasionally, just not as an ally.

Romulans - No, nada, no way. Love them as a race, but lets try to keep to canon. As such I haven't included them in the poll.

Cardassians - It's never stated when first contact was made, so they could be included. However I feel that DS9 did a great job of exploring them as a race.

Breen - Again, first contact was never stated, but they're treated as a real mystery in DS9. Even though I want to know more about them, I have to say no. Due to how much of a mystery they are in DS9 I haven't included them in the poll.

Tholians - They made quite an impression and I love their none humanoid appearance, alien thinking and alien ship designs. That though could be rather limiting and costly.

Orion Syndicate - Absolutely. They've never been really explored so there's a lot of worldbuilding people can do there. I'd love to see an Orion Syndicate that's finding the ever growing Federation to be a real threat to it's operations, forcing it to find ""strange new worlds"" to exploit. They'd also make for great character drama, being a crime syndicate.

New - I certainly wouldn't mind, but given the Suliban and Kazon I'm rather worried what a new race would be like.

Other - Maybe Nausicaans pirates. It'd give the writers a chance to try to make them less like a Klingon wannabe.

10,New Trek is just as optimistic as Old Trek,1590071615,"This will be a long post, but I need to get this off my chest. Yes, Discovery and Picard both have more violence and swearing then Treks past, but I still stand by that they still reflect and hold true to the core values that made Star Trek so special to begin with.

Take season one of Discovery, the main conflict of the show is Michael getting a second chance on the Discovery after she let's her own biases and past experience with the Klingons get the better of her and inadvertently plunges the Federation into a bloody war. This war with the Klingons is more then a skirmish for a few systems, it's ideological. The Klingons are shown to be xenophobic, militant and expansionist, as apposed to the Federation's focus on peacful exploration, scientific research and diplomacy. When faced with an enemy that matches them in strength and a worldview utterly incomparable with their own the Federation compromises their values, but the show makes it clear that the ends don't justify the means. In the end the war ends because Michael and by extention Starfleet do the right thing. They don't give in anf hold true to their values. There's a reason that the second half of the season has an extended section in the Mirror Universe, it's to show the crew of the Discovery what a Federation that loses sight of it's ideals will become. The Terran Empire is cruel, see the mycelial network as a resource to exploit rather than a beautiful wondrous part of the galaxy, they treat the other species as expendable resources, they are the worst of humanity. Upon the the Discovery's return to the Prime universe,  Starfleet backed into a corner nearly unleashes a terrible weapon of mass destruction on Qo'noS, and Michael gives L'Rell the key to save their planet. She shows that an act of compassion, made in good faith is what it takes to save the Federation from this crisis. And that's as optimistic a message as anything in  Star Trek.

Picard pulls the same trick, it shows us a Starfleet that when doing quite possibly the most Starfleet action possible, saving Romulan citizens, the oldest reoccurring threat in Star Trek, from the supernova, they get hit below the belt with the attack on Mars. When holding true to their values, the unimaginable happened and they backed away. But again the show tells the audience that Starfleet was wrong to back away and ban the synths. It explains how they where tricked and in the end, Starfleet comes in willing to sacrifice everything to save the Synths from the Romulans. That act of compassion and self sacrifice again is what saves the day. The Federation is at its strongest when it holds to its ideals and core mission, seek out new life 

New Trek pulls the same trick that DS9 did. Both take the values that Roddenberry instilled into this world, but said that humanity can and will live up to these values, but they will have to reaffirm and commit to them every day. Stating these ideals are one thing,  but having them be changed is something else entirely. These shows state that in the darkest of times, when we face the toughest of challenges, that's when our values matter the most. Going forward it looks like Trek is going to stick to their guns, Season 2 of Discovery was much brighter in tone and it looks like season 3 will be about then rebuilding the Federation in the future, while Strage New Worlds is going back to TOS with a show about exploration. Trek hasn't lost sight of it's values, if anything the franchise has gone out of it's own way to show just how important and relevant they are.

30,20 TNG observations from an extremely casual Trek fan,1590038149,"So my wife and I have been rewatching TNG from the beginning during this whole pandemic situation. It might be the first time I’ve seen some of these episodes since they originally aired and some of them I don’t think I’ve ever seen. Anyway, apologies if my thoughts are well worn ground, I’m not up to date on current thinking. Also keep in mind that I’ve only watched through season 4 and I haven’t seen the new shows or the movies with the TNG cast past Generations. Basically I’m saying that your geek knowledge is bigger than mine (that’s why I’m here). Anyway...here goes:

1. How does star fleet have/make any money to use to actually deal with cultures that you know, still use money.

2. Data. For a dude who basically has all the knowledge of the ships computer in his brain (or at least quick access to it) he seems awfully unprepared in a lot of situations. Like when he asks Worf to help him with a wedding gift and seems to not know what’s involved you know, in a wedding. Google that shit man! Come on.

2a. Every time someone uses a phrase he doesn’t understand he ends up defining it back to the person who said it. Yeah man, they know what it means. Just read the urban dictionary page to yourself. 

2b. Whenever anyone thinks Data is taking too long to explain something they essentially interrupt him and tell him to shut up. Would they do that to someone else on the crew who actually had feelings? (Yes, I know Picard yelled at Wesley too, but he kind of had it coming IMO) At one point he seems to become aware of this fact and even points it out to Riker. Quit being a dick, Riker.

2c. Lore as a character is a waste of time. Completely unnecessary. 

3. Worf...kind of sucks at his job. As head of security, how is it possible that he hasn’t been busted back down to ensign and assigned to a garbage scow? How many times does someone just beam the captain directly off the bridge or beam themselves on to the ship? How many times do questionable aliens get on board and just have run of the ship? He gets beat in nearly every fight he gets into outside of the Holo deck. I’m sure there are other things I’m not remembering here but....he’s just terrible at his job.

4. The safety protocols for visiting a new planet could really use some revision. Going down unarmed? Cool. And is it absolutely necessary to take senior, department head level folks down to every plant you go to? 

5. What’s the deal with booking time on the holodeck?  Aren’t there 1000 people onboard? How is it ever free? Is there a signup sheet somewhere?

5a. In reality, the holodeck would almost only be used for porn.

6. Why doesn’t anyone lock their doors or ask who it is when someone rings the doorbell? 

7. How are there no security cameras on the enterprise?

8. What’s the deal with the communicator? Sometimes you have to push to talk, sometimes you don’t....

9. Why do turbo lifts exist when point to point beaming is a thing?

9a. Why are there no stairwells next to the turbo lifts in case of emergency

10. I feel like the transporters could cure literally every disease and aren’t being taken advantage of.

10a. How has no one ever been beamed into a wall or coffee table? 

11. Never liked Yar that much as a character. 

12. Never liked Pulaski that much either. 

13.  That Enterprise ship design still holds up. 

14. Wait. When did data get a cat?

15. There’s 0% chance that Wesley wasn’t the most hated person on that ship. He gets obvious preferential treatment from senior staff, gets a spot on the bridge, can tie up vital ship resources for his “experiments,” AND gets to wear a uniform before going through through the academy? There’s no way the bar staff in 10 forward aren’t spitting in every one of his drinks.

16. Drinks in 10 forward are free right? When someone asks if they can get you a drink, is it really that big of a favor?

17. Picard loves being a lawyer

18. Riker is kind of a creep. 

19. I wish this show was written with today’s sensibilities. Getting Picard back from the Borg storyline could have been all of season 4 and I would have been cool with it. 

20. No one seems to cook any more. Can you not just replicate ingredients? Does it have to be a complete dish?

33,My best friend asked me why I'd stopped raving about Star Trek since a couple of years ago,1590036796,"I'm nearly 20 and most people my age don't know that Star Trek is a franchise which mainly exists outside of the recent Kelvin universe movies. In my family however, we're big fans of Trek and have spent the better part of my life watching Trek at the dinner table. I spent my formative years being inspired by Gene Roddenberry's ideals and Trek has played a big role in making me who I am today.

A few days ago, my best friend who I've known for 8 years now asked me why I'd stopped raving about Star Trek to him recently. What follows was my mostly unedited, ranty attempt to explain the pain I felt. I'm sure many of you feel the same way. I had no closure until just a few days ago, probably because I didn't look in the right place(s). Hopefully this gives some of you closure now.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;You probably know that I'm a huge fan of Star Trek: The Next Generation starring the likes of Sir Patrick Stewart, Jonathon Frakes, Brent Spiner, Michael Dorn, Levar Burton, Gates McFadden, Marina Sirtis, Denise Crosby, Wil Wheaton, etc.  
&gt;  
&gt;You probably know that I have tremendous respect for the character Patrick Stewart plays: Captain Jean Luc Picard. You may know that I have often remarked that people across the world should strive to be like him.  
&gt;  
&gt;ST: TNG wrapped up in the mid-90s. There were two other ST shows still running at the time but all of them completed production around the start of the millennium.  
&gt;  
&gt;You also probably know, that the Star Wars franchise was recently resuscitated, beginning with the release of Star Wars: Episode 7 in 2015. Probably inspired by the renewed commercial success of the SW franchise, this chap called Alex Kurtzman decided to reboot the ST franchise and has started creating new ST shows.   
&gt;  
&gt;In 2017, the first season of ST: Discovery dropped. I was damn excited but didn't get around to watching it because of college entrance exams and stuff. I think I only ended up watching it after my first or second semester here.  
&gt;  
&gt;Disco was a tad disappointing. It wasn't much like (-inf, 2001) Trek aka real ST. The optimistic view of the future and what humans could be with just a little more compassion was lost. There were neither questions, not discussions about morality, philosophy or what it means to be a good human being. ST was now action-packed and full of high-budget special effects just for the sake of special effects, glorified violence and given that it was meant to be a prequel to most of the other shows, honestly would've broken canon if not for a very convenient plot device in the season-finale. Most characters were foul-mouthed, edgy, immature and seemed to be written to push an agenda. I felt that it's messaging was even toxic at times, filled with ultra-leftist (read feminazi, reverse-racism) writing, seeming to have been written by the same people who'd cry racism and/or sexism if the races/sexes were simply flipped.   
&gt;  
&gt;I wouldn't go so far as to say that it's objectively a bad show. Someone unfamiliar with Trek may actually approve of it. But this was not Trek. It lacked everything that made Trek great and separated it from your cheap-thrills Battlestar Galactica. At least I felt this way.  
&gt;  
&gt;But I tried not to take it too hard. ST: TNG sucked in its first two seasons too albeit for different reasons. I told myself that it'd get better as the show progresses.  
&gt;  
&gt;Then, they announced a new show: 'Star Trek: Picard' which was supposed to follow my aforementioned favorite character years after the events of ST: TNG and played by Patrick Stewart, no less. I was excited as hell. When I did start watching it, I was devastated. This was even less like Trek than Disco was. This was like 13 Reasons Why + Mission Impossible shit set in the Star Trek universe, except without a coherent or even an interesting plot. The only thing the main character in the show and Captain Jean Luc Picard had in common were their names. This was not the Picard I knew and looked up to. A few other characters from a few other shows briefly reprised their roles too but this show was bullshit. There was so much drama that it was like watching an Indian soap-opera. I had to force myself to keep watching.  
&gt;  
&gt;Basically, I got the impression that Kurtzman has either never watched Trek or never understood what the late Gene Roddenberry was trying to convey through Trek. And he's in charge of where Star Trek goes today.  
&gt;  
&gt;I consider myself something of a true Trekkie. I've watched every episode of every Star Trek show and every movie there is. I've watched most of them multiple times, even. I have an obligation to watch Disco and Picard too. I can't bring myself to just abandon them.  
&gt;  
&gt;My dad likes these two new shows too. And the responses in their respective subreddits were overwhelmingly positive. So I got the impression that I was more or less alone in my criticism of Kurtzman's ""Trek"".  
&gt;  
&gt;Last night, I found a thick vein of sharp criticism directed towards Kurtzman's ""Trek"" on YouTube and on IMDb. I went to bed last night, content that the vast majority of Trekkies actually share my disappointment. Take a look at some of the reviews for ST: Picard here: [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8806524/reviews?ref\_=tt\_urv](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8806524/reviews?ref_%3Dtt_urv&amp;sa=D&amp;source=hangouts&amp;ust=1590116798729000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH2R2YUp9cXFOFjmAY8d-Ox91b1uA)

34,"The ""humbling"" of Admiral Picard",1590036574,"https://www.startrek.com/news/the-humbling-of-admiral-picard

This is an article on startrek.com, which means it's officially sanctioned.

If you haven't finished the first season of Picard, this is a spoiler warning to stop reading.

In my view, this sort of thing is a big problem, and is one reason for the backlash of the modern iterations of star trek.

Picard doesn't need to be humbled, because he earned his position and rank.  He's not an evil mustache twirling villain who does bad things to people, and doesn't deserve to be treated as such.

I'll go through some of the author's flawed points, and why they are flawed.

1.  Picard is finally getting old

""Picard still seems to view himself as at least a little immortal""

Really?  What's your basis for this?

""He’s in no position to save anybody and, in fact, his inability to do so results in Dahj’s untimely death. ""

You're blaming him for that?

""His resignation wrecked his relationships""

Picard and Raffi had a ""relationship?""  They seemed like nothing more than co-workers.  It's like when the big boss of the company exits the company and doesn't talk to anyone except family and friends, why would the director of operations feel slighted?  It makes no sense.  It also seemed bizarre to me that Raffi would be booted out of starfleet because Picard quit.

""His friends make him a better person""

""Because your friends are the ones who can tell you when you’re effing up.”And, as the finale reveals, they can even save you from yourself. ""

Picard had plenty of experience with raising children and grandchildren from that probe in the Inner Light, but the writers completely failed to take that into account.  They portrayed him as an inexperienced parent, so there should never have been any 'effing up"" in the first place here.

I can understand the journalist's point of view, in that all ""privileged"" people need to be taken down a peg.  In some cases that is warranted, but it's completely out of line in this situation.  

It's a shame that the people running this franchise now haven't given this much critical thought, or they agree with it.  At this point, I would actually like to see Rick Berman return, or Ira Behr and Ronald D. Moore.",startrek,candyman420,False,/r/startrek/comments/gnqh9o/the_humbling_of_admiral_picard/

There could have been a lifeform somewhere in the universe that came into existence literally billions of years before it evolved on Earth. They could have been exploring the universe for a billion years by the time humans evolved here. You can probably do a lot of shit in a billion years.

They might not have visited Earth in the recent past but maybe they did 750 million years ago or something. So I definitely think it's plausible that our planet has been observed by another lifeform at some point in time. We certainly would be doing that if we had the technology. Maybe they even are responsible for seeding life on Earth in the first place.

Maybe this is why I really liked the Star Trek episodes with the Dinosaur species that escaped Earth and is super old. Can't remember their name though.",startrek,teutonicnight99,False,/r/startrek/comments/gnqac0/i_think_its_certainly_possible_earth_has_been/

If you haven't, I seriously encourage you to see it!!!!  This won't make sense if you don't know it, and it's just a brilliant and subversive watch from how you think it's going to go at the start.*

I haven't seen some episodes of TNG in many, many years.  I threw on this one as a random rewatch while I cooked and ate my lunch.  I ended up absolutely bawling at the end.  But it was a good cry, a kind of catharsis.  An understanding.

Long story short, quarantine has been the worst emotional point of my life, as I'm sure it has been for many people.  I have been becoming utterly lost in regret.  The 'what-if's' of my life.  Broken friendships and relationships, stupid nights out earlier in my twenties, being too slow to truly to commit to my music and art, and on and on with so very many decisions in this existence of mine.  I'm sure a lot of people feel the same thing.  For the first time in my life I haven't had any distractions in my life, nothing but my own thoughts that I couldn't ignore any longer by going out/partying/jamming with my music pals/everything that goes with my personal real life routine.  All of this combined with an industry I was finally moving into collapsing completely out of my control.  And in the end it was starting to leave me intensely suicidal.  The feeling was controlled still, but growing every day like a weed.  

The few times I've tried to open up to people in my life, it seems to always become the same phrases and platitudes.  ""You can't change the past"".  ""Don't stress it man"".  ""Regret is toxic"".  And I understand the meaning of those words, the intent, and the truth in them.  But I never really ""got"" it.  It's hard to explain, but there's a difference between understanding words, even agreeing with them, and truly feeling the impact of them.

At the end of Tapestry, when Picard says ""I would rather die as the man I was"" to Q, I started to ""get"" it.  And later, when Picard is speaking with Riker, he talks about how when he pulled one string, it unraveled the tapestry of his life.  He wasn't the same human being at the episode's emotional climax anymore.

All this pain, all this regret, all these decisions that seem so stupid or wasteful in retrospect...it makes me who and what I am.  Even if I could change these things, I wouldn't be this same human being anymore.  My tapestry, my identity, would be something entirely different.  And what would be the point of that? 

Again, these are all ideas I already told myself, and agree with.  But for the first time in so long, I ""get"" it.  And for the first time in so, SO long I felt the feeling of truly letting go of what I can't change.  This is why we have art I suppose, to say the things to us that simple words cannot truly describe.

I love Star Trek so much.  It's never about the violence or the ships or the technology or the canon for me.  It's about humanity.  It's about being your best self, accepting what you can't change, and striving forward.  

I just wanted to share.  I hope you're all staying well and safe in these wild times.  If you're feeling the emotions I feel, I encourage you to rewatch it.  And remind your friends and family that you love them.

A lot of my original problem with this show was not connecting to the characters. I really really don’t like watching the ferengi. They put me off as a kid and honestly still do. So I’m not thrilled that one is a main character. I really like the doctor guy who’s name I didn’t pick up on, Dax, and O’Brien. I vaguely like Kira (as in, I’m interested). I didn’t like Sisko, the ferengi guy, or the security guy. I’m honestly a little confused about how command is working on this station, and how much is military/civilian. I really have no comments on the plot, other than being vaguely annoyed that we had to watch Sisko’s wife die fifteen times.

First episode of season 2. Major Kira and O'Brien are escaping Cardassia IV with Li Nalas and other Bajoran prisoners after a daring raid. Four prisoners stay behind to cover their withdrawal with phaser fire. Kira is hesitant to launch because she wants to wait for those others. 

But why? They already knew they could beam up the prisoners to the runabout, two at a time. They discussed but rejected that plan because the jail guards would have found a way to stop them after they beamed up the first two.  

But once they've already escaped the prison and its force field, this should no longer be a concern. O'Brien and the Major could have just launched the run-about and then beamed up the others, two at a time -- no problem.

When you're older, you've already established your personality and become frustrated by expecting everyone else (like media, family members, governments, workplaces) to conform to what you want them to be. This is exactly what happens to Picard as he sees that Starfleet has changed from something he loved to something that has disappointed him. It's a paradox: watching something about getting older you can identify with, but you're too old to identify with it.

Riker would sponsor me to enter the Academy and join Starfleet, and maybe someday Picard would welcome me to be part of the crew.

3,What has the Star Trek Fandom become?,1589988689,"This is direct response to the top post right now on this sub.

I am a little confused here.  There has been relative positivety surrounding Picard, then all of a sudden a post comes in basically crapping on, Discovery, J.J., and Picard all in one.

Half the fans I see in there have never posted on this sub, nor even made a comment about trek in their post history.

Why is it that when a post like that makes it to the top, we start getting people out of the wood work that just do nothing but regurgitate the same points that already have been brought up countless times before?

I have said this many times, but my mother who is 75 years old, literally grew up with trek.  On her 12 hour work shifts, she would take breaks just to catch Star Trek TOS on TV.  

She is in love in JJ trek, and also Picard.  She couldn't stop texting me about it.  I can actually show you all the texts we have sent back and forth about the show.  

It's really sad to see people like OP in the original post call the show ""trash"" it really saddens me as a fan since I was 8, that they are calling MODERN trek, where we have over 8 shows currently, trash.

This is uncalled for and doesn't promote discussion, but promotes hatred.  It promotes people to come out of the wood work and just blindly hate on something, because another video basically told them too.

And I am not kidding,in the Plinkett video he literally says to people to boycott Star Trek.  And the original post, is exactly doing that, amongst the people on that post.

This is not good, nor is it good for the fandom or the sub reddit.  Watch the video, they literally tell you to boycott Star Trek.  

People say ""don't let it bother me."" But it does bother me, when you can't even have an opposite opinion without being attacked or downvoted for an *opposite* opinion.  

Star Trek as a show and movies, has grown with the times.  It is no longer the 60's.  We have had adventure, politics, drama all in one in Picard and in Discovery.  People dismiss this as it's not in there, but there is plenty of it.

5,The Importance of Gary Mitchell,1589987620,"The character of Gary Mitchell is one of the reasons I prefer production order to broadcast order.  Kirk's best friend before Spock.  If a young Kirk does appear in Strange New Worlds I hope they remember the impact Mitchell is supposed to have on his young character.  ""I remember you from the Academy a walking book with legs!""  Young Kirk wasn't a rule breaker but a military brat who took things overly seriously.

&gt;In my review of ""Where No Man Has Gone Before I wrote this: ""The friendship between Kirk and Mitchell helped the two men cancel each other’s weaknesses.   Kirk taught Mitchell to be a great Starfleet officer and to fly up the ranks of the service.  Mitchell helped turn Kirk from a “stack of books with legs” to a social charmer and ladies’ man.  Traits those are traditionally associated with Captain Kirk. "" 

Maybe in a future appearance Lt. Kirk could be dragging Ensign Mitchell in tow.

6,One of the greatest strengths of the TNG crew is Open-mindedness.,1589987286,"As I’m watching for the first time, episodes after episodes, I noticed something odd. It’s odd because usually in every other tv show the opposite happens:

The Enterprise crew has been trained by Starfleet to always keep an open mind to anything.

Of course there’s the usual conference table brainstorms where everyone’s pitching ideas about the situation at hand. 

But before that, at many occasions nobody would have assessed any problem or situation if it weren’t for some crew member noticing some odd detail and being aware enough to not just brush it off aside. Then they share it with the crew and everybody’s totally on board with it right off the bat because they trust each other so much and more importantly they always keep an open mind about anything since anything can happen at all times.

It usually goes like this:

- Hey, noticed how the captain put down his tea cup in a weird way? He must be possessed by some alien!

- Yeah! That makes perfect sense! Let’s investigate that!


Or...


- Well that’s weird, just had a déjà-vu moment... that should mean we’re stuck in a time loop!

- Yeah! That makes perfect sense! Let’s investigate that!



The usual tv trope would have the rest of the crew doubting that hunch and have the protagonist go through the motions of having to prove to everyone that they’re right. It takes the whole episode and then the matter is quickly resolved at the end.

In TNG they skip through that crap and it allows for more time to really flesh out the sci-fi concept that the episode is exploring.

It will be in a similar vein to Primitive Culture, a series I co-created (and still help produce) for Trek FM which looks at history &amp; culture: www.trek.fm/primitive-culture

Initial topics I’m looking to discuss include:

- The reappearance of capital &amp; lawless economy in post-Neutral Zone PIC.
- DS9’s Past Tense and the American refugee crisis/internment
- T’Kuvma in DISCO &amp; the show’s approach to religious fundamentalism.
- Economically driven Trek societies - Ferengi, Dosi, Malon etc...

I'm very put off by the price tag on Star Trek Adventures but I want a Trek RPG in my life. What are your recommendations for a rules system that fits my needs?

- rules for generating new planets and races
- new race rules are fully fleshed out so you can play them as PC's
- rules that reflect the synergy between crew and starship
- rules for science, diplomatic, engineering and medical PC's
- some ship-to-ship combat rules that aren't bad
- preferably set either in TNG or Enterprise era
- less focus on playing as the TV crews, more focus on new PC's
- ship design rules
- oh yeah, also combat rules, I guess

I know some people might be tempted to suggest Hero or GURPS or Champions ... I'm already aware those games exist and I've ruled out at least Hero and Champions. I previously owned Hero, it's far too many pages and I don't like its structure for creating things, Champions is too superhero focused, and well, maybe you could talk me into GURPS but I really want something either specific to Star Trek or analogous.

Hahaha couldn’t resist that....in all seriousness though, my life literally consists of working and watching Star Trek over and over and over. Particularly TNG, DS9 and VOY but I’ve been known to add ENT and TOS to the list occasionally. This can’t be healthy, in regards to the pattern not the show. I want so much to have a life but have realized that depression can be a P’Tok if left unaddressed and instead of spending my nights with the family or on a hobby, I usually just end up putting on whichever series I’m currently on and fade away.

My SO is about the same and my kids could spot a Vulcan from miles away, but them enjoying my show doesn’t encourage me to get out or even tolerate their shows.

18,"""The Paradise Syndrome"" - First Time Viewing Reaction",1589979716,"Noob Trek 58 - The Paradise Syndrome

Well this season is certainly all over the place as I'd heard. In three episodes I'm in the three extremes of the spectrum. The first episode? Bad. The second episode? Very good. The third episode? Ehhhh, I don't know really. It wasn't that bad, but it wasn't really good, it's a difficult one. Let me unpack what I just watched and I'll see if that helps me make up my mind.

First of all, it's quite a lovely looking episode. There's some good sets and costumes, and we open on a nice outdoorsy scene, highly unusual for the show. But it has happened before... was it in Shore Leave? And maybe perhaps also in By Any Other Name? Oh my god why do I know this stuff off the top of my head. I've become a NERD. Cool. Anyway, after a stunning Lord Of The Rings establishing shot, we find that this lovely idyllic scene of pastoral beauty is about to be DESTROYED BY A METEOR. Dramatic emphasis is mine, Spock delivers this information with about as much enthusiasm as if he were reading a bus schedule.

When Kirk asks ""Spock, it's exactly like Earth on a planet half a galaxy away. What are the odds of such duplication?"", I expected Spock to say ""It seems to happen every two or three weeks captain.""

It's a lovely sounding episode too, it seems like a lot more work was put into the music this time out, which is refreshing after that fight music that plagued Season 2. (Though it would've been sweet if that music had played while Kirk is chasing Miramanee through the woods.)

Btw what does ""bearing 117 mark 4"" and the like mean? I don't know how to interpret this.

Wait a minute, they have 30 minutes to deflect a meteor, so they decide to dick about down here for a while and THEN go and do it? Why don't you deflect the meteor and then explore the planet at your leisure? There's multiple instances of Kirk/Spock/McCoy acting like doofuses here, and the script doesn't do a great job of disguising that they're just doing/saying whatever they need to in order to create the writer's desired situation. McCoy in particular is being written as a moron, as in the scene where Spock actually has to explain that if the planet blows up, Kirk will die, because he is on the planet. I half expected Spock to pull out a whiteboard and draw little explanatory pictures.

Soon the away team stumble across the set of The Lone Ranger. Not more parallel Earth stuff, I thought that was last season.

Well that escalated quickly. One second we're hanging out with Mother Nature, next thing you know, trapdoor, down a pit, mystic runes and lightning bolts and Kirk's face down dead. And this is before the credits!

Ah, an actress in redface. I kinda had the feeling that this was already not cool by 1968, but I was 13 years away from being born in a country far from the US so I may not be the best authority. Can anyone tell me how kosher a white woman putting on redface would have been in 1968? It's odd though, we've already had multiple women of colour appear in speaking roles on TOS, I wonder why they didn't just cast a Native American woman. My bigger problem with Scharf is that she can't act. A pity as this role calls for more than the usual ""stand around and look pretty"" MO of Kirk's conquests, but something about Scharf gets up my nose. ""HE is medicine chief nooooooow."" She sounds like it's her first time acting. This is a problem because caring about Miramanee is going to turn out to be key to the episode's impact, and Scharf did not reel me in.

I feel I've seen this episode before several times - The Omega Glory, The Apple, Friday's Child, etc. Sure it's not exactly the same as those, but it is continuing a worrying trend of being able to slot episodes into recognizable types, and this is a show that I expect innovation from. Mind you I got through 57 years of Doctor Who and it's not as if that doesn't have more than a few episodes that repeat almost note for note the content and structure of earlier adventures.

It's interesting to see Shatner play a confused, uncertain character. A side of Kirk that doesn't want, even fears command. Yet even in this alternate life, Kirk finds himself forced to lead/command when the disasters begin to befall the land. This kind of links into something else I notice during this episode - Shatner's looking older. He's 37 now, not exactly a grandpa (two years younger than I am now) but he seems to be putting on weight and his hair doesn't have the same luster it once did. In a way (and I'm sure this is pure coincidence, if this is intentional then I'm beyond impressed) it's interesting that I notice this during an episode in which Kirk almost settles down. Maybe he's getting a bit beyond flying around in a tin can being shot at by aliens, maybe it's time to find someone he loves and raise a child. Oh, and in closeup, the ritual cloak makes Shatner look like a low-budget Elvis impersonator.

The bit where Shatner spreads his arm with an euphoric look on his face and says ""I have found paradise"" nearly made me spit out my drink it was so funny. It also suits Shatner's ego that he says ""Surely no man has ever found such happiness"" as he embraces himself. He then goes to his own wedding dressed as the great bird of the galaxy.

Decent fight scene that Kirk has with Salish, though Salish just sort of fizzles out. I thought he would either execute some dastardly scheme to destroy Kirk and steal Miramanee away, or perhaps the other trope in which Salish realises Kirk's goodness and his own inferority and has a change of heart, saving Kirk at some critical moment and dying himself in the process. (Notice that both these typical outcomes are racist regarding what they say about the old trope of native women and white men- Salish is just outclassed/inferior, there's no storyline possible in which she would prefer him.) But no, Salish ends up hanging around and not really having any big moment. Yes, he gets Miramanee killed in an offhand way but there's no apparent follow-up or repercussions, he just casually murders a pregnant woman and then goes about his day.

The scenes aboard the Enterprise are okay, but not that interesting. It's now Spock's turn to be written bone headedly, ignoring Scotty's warnings about the engines and then concocting some nonsensical plan about blowing the meteor up into many smaller meteors which is clearly worse, then trying his best to get the ship hit by it. Then he spends a long time looking at his screen, McCoy comes in and roleplays mom telling him to stop playing League Of Legends (and Spock does what any young man who had been playing League Of Legends would do), then he decides the sigils are musical notes. (Not that this matters because nothing musical is ever done with them. I thought we were going to see Spock go all Ocarine Of Time on us.)

This episode does have a case of the Great White Saviours. The natives are so dumb and pathetic and so grateful for Kirk to show them that water can flow down channels and how to take off shirts or that fire creates light and other things far beyond them. We miss the scene where he explains to Miramanee where babies come from but it clearly happened. Also: ""I didn't make the lamp to keep you forever cooking. I made it to keep you forever fucking.""  Ick. Hey come on, be honest, you mentally completed that line the same way I did. I was beginning to be intrigued by how serious Kirk was getting with Miramanee - did I have this episode wrong? Is Miramanee not just the babe of the week? Kirk has never gotten this heavy with a woman on the show before. He's married and she's got a bun in the oven - how are they going to wave this away at the end of the episode? Maybe they're going to give him a child, develop the character a bit? Yes I know, I should have known better.

I am distracted by how the medicine man band Kirk wears looks like a doctor's head mirror. I keep thinking Kirk is going to check my molars.

When Spock asks ""Why were you being stoned?"" I have to pause the video and laugh. It's true, Kirk and his pregnant wife went to the temple and got stoned, lol.

Why is there a mind wiping machine under the deflector? And saying ""Kirk to Enterprise"" opens the trap door? ................................... I can't adequately express the mental scream of rage that took place in my mind at this moment. That's one of the silliest coincidences I've ever seen in fiction and the writer should be ashamed of themselves. Also, the solving of the temple is anti-climactic. Spock pushes one button and everything is fine?

Holy shit, they killed Miramanee and the baby, that's awful. Didn't see that coming. This show doesn't mind throwing the woman of the week under the bus (see last episode) but still this is a women in refrigerators moment. (Women in refrigerators is a comic nerd term for a writer abusing female characters in order to serve the arc of a man, in this case the need for Kirk to be free so he can go gallivanting about the universe like nothing ever happened. It's a comic nerd term because it comes from an incident in which DC Comics was trying to give Green Lantern more significant villains, and they decided a villain who killed his girlfriend would drum up interest, so they gave GL this new girlfriend, featured her prominently for six months and then had him come home one day to find her murdered corpse stuffed in his fridge by said villain. I am not making this up, it was quite a big deal in comic circles.) It would probably be fine if some respect was paid to Miramanee by Kirk remembering her in future episodes, or needing time to get over her, but given previous form on this show, I'm fairly confident she'll be gone and forgotten once the credits roll. Happy to be proven wrong though. The way the credits linger over Kirk literally watching her die brings some seriousness to the situation and is quite uncomfortable, but then it crashes to the ship zooming away with almost comical abandon, the continuing situation on the planet completely unexplored.

So did I like this episode? It's the most hesitant I've ever been to answer this question. But if I'm not allowed to chicken out and say ""mixed"", if I have to say yes or no then... it's no. Though there is some intriguing and profound potential here, a tendency to not follow through, plot holes, suspect acting, clunky dialogue, and an uncomfortably patronizing portrayal of Native Americans all combine to make me slowly turn my thumb down. It's no flaming disaster, but it would never be a favourite of mine either.

Oh, because I was conflicted on this episode, I read some other reviews of it to help clarify my own thoughts, and I found this absolute gem which I had to steal and will leave you with. Credit to the original author, Brian S.

58,I have to talk about the Uber synths(yes I now I’m late),1589943937,"I recently watched the last episode and was enjoying Picard(somewhat) up until then. These just don’t work. They are on the same level of the Pah-wraiths from DS9. 

Let me explain.

1.show don’t tell

I think I learned this in 4th grade. You need to show the reader/watcher instead of telling them. Telling someone, “this person is a threat” it won’t be as good as me actually showing you that this person is a threat. The Dominion is a really good example of a threat done well. You are shown what they are capable of. They hurt our characters. They take the space station we have known for 5 seasons. 

Now let’s look at the other end of the spectrum, the Pah-Wraiths. Look, there are a lot of other things I don’t like about this plot line, but let’s skip that in favor of a shorter post. The problem with the Pah-Wraiths is that they are only a threat for about 5 minutes at the end of, “What you Leave Behind.” Also, this comes after the climax with the Dominion, so you already had your excitement. Along with this, it is a tell and not a show. You are told of the power they hold and that they are bad, but you really only see this in the bit in the season 6 finale. So when the Pah wraiths come, you don’t know what they hold other than what you have been told.

The Uber synths fall into the latter category. You are only told that they will, “wipe out all organic life.” You never get shown what they do, what they have done, or heck what they look like before the last 30 minutes of the show. Heck, you don’t know anything beyond that they hate organic life for abusing synths. Everything is told to you and nothing is shown.

2.cliche

“They will destroy all life in the Galaxy” is possibly the most cliched line in all of film/tv now. Whenever I hear it I roll my eyes. Honestly, the only place where it belongs is a Marval movie, because stakes there realistically get that high. However, Star Trek isn’t a superhero film, so I feel like you need more nuance than that. The destroy life in Galaxy threat never comes to fruition, and constantly suffers from the show don’t tell problem. You can’t show it since if you did you couldn’t have a Galaxy. It’s an, “all or nothing” threat. Where the threat has won or it is not there. 

3.too early

This ironically suffers from the opposite problem the Pah-Wraiths had. It’s to early. The threat is so massive that the next one would be incomparable to it. Along with this, it is season 1, the introductory season. The threat isn’t there. I mean the threat it too big to be there anyway, but there is no way they would kill off one of the characters they just introduced, I mean they were to scared to kill off Picard(even though they still wanted the emotional effect), so there is no way they would kill of Rios, Soji, etc.",startrek,Ra1ds4ad0w,False,/r/startrek/comments/gn3h4m/i_have_to_talk_about_the_uber_synthsyes_i_now_im/

72,Star Trek is about deconstructing society. New Trek feels hollow because it is about deconstructing Star Trek.,1589932578,"I liked Picard and Discovery a lot, but when it comes to the question of whether or not they fit into the idea of what ""Star Trek"" really is, I think they fall short. 

The original series was a deconstruction of society. A flat-out rejection of modern problems, showing a multi-cultural crew solving problems in a post-scarcity society where humanity has *developed itself* out of ancient sources of conflict. This was at the height of the cold war, when bleak pragmatism and separation ruled the day, when starvation was a fact of life for billions and most of the planet was still recovering from or descending into horrendous violence. 

Little of this has changed since TOS, into the times of Picard. 10 million people starve to death every year, and millions more are lost to insufficient water and medicine. China and America are carving the planet into spheres of domination. Plague, famine, genocide across Asia, Africa, the Middle East.

But it seems like the writers are convinced that something has changed, that Star Trek *needs* to be dark to be relevant. As if a lot of the things it had to say were quaint artifacts of cold war fear, as if it was limited by the constraints of Roddenberry's description of what the Federation actually *is.* Frankly, I find the idea that this kind of conflict is necessary for storytelling to be lazy and nihilistic. 

The writers spend so much time breaking down the idea of Utopia, completely missing the point: That, when we finally learn to *take care of ourselves,* we are capable of anything. 

The Federation as portrayed in modern Trek seems so foreign because the writers to write in a world where the Federation is mostly just an ideological dream held together by pragmatic hard-edged people who *know the truth about things.* As if the delicate balance played out in DS9 played out entirely in favor of those who see the Federation as the average Cardassian or Romulan does: hypocritical salesmen that aren't *really* that good.

Star Trek is written to show us that Utopia is possible, and that it comes from real material things: a prosperous society filled with people who are secure in their selves and their homes. Star Trek is about leaving behind that *real and existing utopia* to see what is out there in the broader world, because they know that Utopia is not the end-all-be-all. Not that the Utopia is ""fake"", but that it has enabled them to experience what exists outside of and beyond it in ways that modern audiences currently believe to be socially  impossible. Utopia, is, after all, against our *nature,* they say. But any anthropologist will tell you, the idea is a lie. 

We need Star Trek to be optimistic and Utopian in order to give ourselves permission to actually build that society. Nobody works towards something that they are raised to believe is impossible.",startrek,kodiakus,False,/r/startrek/comments/gn0e87/star_trek_is_about_deconstructing_society_new/

1.All these people he has known for like, a week.
Besides Raffi and Elnor, but all of these people barely know him. I’m surprised any of them felt for him beyond, “oh no. Well, he was old.”


2. It is the first season of a show titled, “PICARD”

Of course they aren’t going to kill him off. Heck, by now we know Picard has been green lit for another season. There isn’t any tension(same with the Uber synths but I’ll get to that later). If this was a movie it would be fine, because you know he would die. But this is a TV show, it doesn’t matter what happens when you still have another season.

3.Golem...really?

First off Real creative. Secondly, this is the biggest cop out I have seen since Rise of Skywalker’s crap. Picard is dead, but now he is just placed in a Golem that is exactly like him. Same age, still susceptible to dying. Still has the stamina of an 80 year old. It’s just Picard again. You could’ve had Q, you could have had something else and it would still be the same. There is no tension or sadness because I know he will be back. Also, you have to earn emotion from me. This just felt like, “okay big climax, Picard dies!” “Wait, but we still have more seasons.” “Ah fuck it, just place him in that plot devi- I mean Golem and we’ll be good.”

Am I correct in saying Pike knows not just his fate, but also the general details of what led to it (training accident?)

Knowing that, I think it would release him to make some bold/brave/crazy choices.  For example, under attack by 7 Romulan ships, there is a 1 in a million chance that flying a shuttle into the disrupter cannon of the lead ship will destroy it and the others and somehow the shuttle escapes.  Pike has to try it, he knows he must survive... Why not give it a go?

The Defiant goes to check out a space rift that exists around a nebula, when they get there they are hailed by the planet by their descendants. You see it turns out that originally after the Defiant scanned the rift and left the planet's orbit they were sent 300 years into the past where they crashed on the planet. Trapped with no one to call for help they eventually settled down and started a new community. 

The rest of the episode is a moral dilemma do they now make sure they avoid the rift and stop themselves being trapped but in doing so ensure that settlement never existed taking life away from the 8,000 current residents as well as all the past ones, cue lots of scenes with crewmembers bonding with cute kids. There is a big problem, Kira dies if they do go back in time. Eventually they go for a needs of the many and agree to go back in time but alas when they try they find someone has rigged the defiant to make sure it avoids the time travel course and they are all fine. Everyone on the planet cease to exist. 

Turns out the planet Odo who had survived for the 300 years did the dead because he loves Kira and couldn't face her dying. Normal Odo tells Kira he knows this because planet Odo linked with him before they left.

My problem with this is that it means normal Odo knew what he'd done and just kept quiet about it as their wishes were ignored. They are upset at planet Odo for doing this but no one balls Odo out for staying quiet. He is as culpable surely?

As if she’s the first passive aggressive female character to be written as such on a SOAP OPERA (that happens to be in space...). 

Keiko and Miles had spats and Star Fleet put a strain on their marriage for sure... but it wasn’t like she was an ice queen or their relationship imploded over the issue.  I don’t even remember her being THAT passive aggressive... It’s also a sci-fi soap opera, so take it with a grain of salt... unless of course it’s too much fun to do otherwise 😉  (part of the reason soap operas exist in the first place).  But yeah, I don’t think Keiko hate is warranted and I think the fan drama around her and Mile’s marriage is overblown.  In a galaxy filled with monster god entities, a nearly invincible army of space robots, shapeshifters with an inexhaustible legion of genetically engineered warriors, Worf delivering babies, mind control, space Mongols, and the inexcusable abomination that is Wesley Crusher... they did juuuuuuust fine as a married couple.

11,The False Promise of a Star Trek Utopia,1589907242,"I have now come to terms that a Star Trek future in unattainable. I grew up watching Star Trek. My most formative years were filled with the rhetoric of Gene Roddenberry; his ideals of embracing other cultures, duty to your fellow human, and maintaining a curious mind have all defined every fiber of my being. With this said, my mind infused with the promise of a better future, a righteous future, I find myself increasingly repulsed whilst re-watching TNG, DS9, VOY, even ENT. These are all great shows with great stories and even better messages for humanity, but with all that is occurring in the modern world, I can't help but feel that a universe in which humans care for each other and think logically is one that is far too alien, even for Star Trek. 

I understand that every Star Trek series has dealt with these issues: The War Provoking Captain Maxwell, and others, in TNG, Section 31 in DS9, the Equinox in VOY, the bureaucracy of ENT. That being said, I still feel that our future holds only these malpractices. These inhuman acts of humanity that scar our morals and our beliefs. 

Planet Earth has seen a worrying increase in Xenophobia, Nationalism, Hate Crimes, Propaganda, False Reporting, Sensationalism, Disregard for Human Life, even Wars fought on premises based in fantasy. Remember Captain Maxwell? ""American Interest"" in 2003 saw his motives come to life, this time there was no Picard or O'Brien to stop him, except in Maxwell's case there actually WERE weapons. Section 31 exists in every nation. The exploitation of people in lower income groups and child labor exists to fuel our Equinox. Our future holds only the blunders of the Star Trek Utopia.

We the humans race, in our infinite wisdom and caring souls, are the Xenophobic Romulans, the War Mongering Klingons, the Nationalist Cardassians, the Greedy Ferengi, the Subversive Breen. All of the Aliens in the Star Trek Universe are symbols and metaphors for the best and worst parts of Humanity. Maybe Gene Roddenberry knew exactly what he was doing when he filled the Galaxy nearly to the brim with the Races that embody the worst of the Human. Maybe he did this to highlight the virtue of the human race. Maybe it was a cautionary Tactic. Maybe he simply cared about producing entertaining TV. No matter what his goal, I now know that it was foolish to assume humans could ever achieve a level of goodness as portrayed by Star Trek. 

I ***LOVE*** Star Trek. Please don't assume I don't. I have watched and re watched nearly every series. I have tried to sculpt my life with the Diplomacy of Picard and Archer, the Brave Action of Sisko and Janeway, the Curiosity of Data, the Boldness of Kirk. I have tried to learn to break out of the old leather Picard speaks of in The Wounded. I love the universe and do wish the Star Trek is more prophetic than I give it credit.

Please feel free to affirm my beliefs, or give me hope that I am wrong about what I have said today.

I fully believe that this post adheres to all of the rules of both reddit and the Star Trek subreddit, which I love so much, especially all of your sharing and the great work on behalf of the Mods and Admins. I believe that though this post discusses a lot of modern issues -I tried to be as vague as possible-  it directly ties itself to the Star Trek universe. Star Trek is based upon the issues and morals of Modern Society and is derived from political, social, religious, and economic thought.

32,"I just spent the last couple of months at home watching Star Trek, AMA",1589893008,"Joke title, but I did spend the last couple of months at home watching all of Star Trek. I had seen most of it before, although some of it not for decades. Some random thoughts on each series:  

TOS:  
This is series feels pretty ancient now. The remaster has improved the film quality, although the new special effects look a bit crappy. 
-Kirk and Spock are more three dimensional characters that the JJ movies give them credit for.  
-I know the show was very progressive for its time, but a lot of its values still feel really dated ie women for the most part stand there looking pretty, get flirted at or care for the male characters; for a show about tolerance, McCoy hurls at lot of racial barbs at Spock, etc. 
-It's great seeing some of the classic scenes again, although a lot of the episodes drag a bit. 
-TOS reminds me of channel flicking late at night as a kid and stumbling across episodes. It's still nice to get that nostalgia hit.  

TAS:  
-It had some interesting moments, but it feels like they could never reconcile having the freedom to tell out-there sci-fi stories that being animated gave them, with the expectation that being animated means the show is supposed to be for kids.  
-The low production quality (repeating animations, Doohan voicing most characters outside the main crew etc.) was sometimes distracting.  

TOS Movies:
-I think Star Trek has a bit of an identity crisis when it comes to movies. The concept naturally lends itself to TV, but seems to struggle with films.  
-I liked most of these films less than I remember (tragically I didn't find TVH particularly funny this time), the main exceptions being TUC, which is still a great send off to the crew, and TMP, which is much more interesting than I thought it was as a kid, props to them for trying something different.  

TNG:  
-Yep, still one of the greatest TV shows of all time. 
-Picard is more of a standout character than I remember. Stewart is often fantastic and the character in general is great. His confidence and maturity is fairly rare in modern TV.  
-This show often gets criticised for having a weak first couple of seasons, but I didn't find them as bad as they are often made out to be, Season 2 was mostly enjoyable. Season 1 had its moments, although even when it was being a hot mess, you could still tell the elements were there. 
-Even though season 3 and 4 are the show's peak, the show doesn't decline in quality that much, season 5 and 6 are generally pretty great too. 
-the remaster looks beautiful, it's such a pity that it looks like other shows won't get the same treatment. 

TNG movies:
-First Contact was great, Generations and Insurrection were ok, Nemesis was a very disappointing send off for the crew.  

DS9:
-What a show, masterful development of characters, storylines and worldbuilding over the first few seasons for a massive payoff in the last couple of seasons. 
-It really felt like DS9 took the TNG world and pushed it further, thematically and also technically.
-Pity the film quality is so bad, especially in the first couple of seasons.  

VOY:  
-Great premise of marooning a starship on the other side of the galaxy by itself with two crews that have to come together. 
-Felt like the writers never lived up to the premise, although it was a good show for the most part.
-Who thought it would be a good idea to put Brannon Braga in charge of a Star Trek show? 
-Half the cast get barely any lines or plot-focus, especially after Seven turns up. The Doctor is consistently brilliant though.  

Enterprise:
-I found this one reasonably dull. It got better as it went on, but I think a prequel was a wrong move from the start, plus the show just felt tired compared to its predecessors.  

JJ Trek:
-the first one was a pretty decent action romp, probably as good as you could expect from a Star Trek film given they were trying to get bums back on seats outside the fandom. The second one was a terrible rehash of TWOK. The third one was decent, although I felt it wasn't quite as good as the fans wanted it to be.  
-the cast of these films were great.  

DSC:
-I loved the way this approached storybuilding the opposite to DS9, instead of giving you seasons to get invested in the drama, have the main character mutiny and start a war within five minutes of the show starting.
-Burnham is a bizarre choice for a main character. Human, raised by Vulcans, yet very impulsive, emotionally unstable. Her main hook seems to be making stupid decisions and crying.  
-Too many mysteries on top of mysteries. 
-Serial storytelling is fairly weak and plotholed.
-The show gets more interesting when it has more self-contained adventures, but stuff like the red angel was never interesting.
-Hopefully season three will fix some of its weak points and its far future setting might be more interesting than being yet another show set in Trek's past.
-Who thought it would be a good idea to Alex Kurtzman in charge of a Star Trek show?  

Picard:
-Oh god, this just turns up the dial on all Discovery's issues around mystery boxes, bad serialisation, plotholes etc. It was genuinely very disappointing to see a show starring one of my favourite characters end up so bad.",startrek,ConstantineXII,False,/r/startrek/comments/gmo1gj/i_just_spent_the_last_couple_of_months_at_home/

57,I'm glad I waited for Star Trek: Picard to come out before deciding if I wanted to watch it.,1589879948,"Personally, from what I've seen, it really isn't to my taste.

I suppose the most negative reviews of this show could be cherrypicking the most extreme examples of this show being over the top action-splodey schlock, but of the positive and negative reception to the show, I think I've been won over by the negative side. I remember being hyped when Patrick Stewart annouced his return to Star Trek, and I was hoping for a more low-key, dialogue heavy show. Sadly, I haven't seen anything that indicates that this is the case.

I'm not a hardcore fan, but I liked the reboot movies well enough - 3 &gt; 1 &gt; 2. On a side note, it's a genuine shame that the fourth movie has been trapped in development hell, because with Beyond I thought that the movies were hitting their stride. I've seen a bit of TNG, and of what I've seen of it, I find myself eating up every little thing about it. The set design, the dialogue, the episodes that don't take themselves super seriously while still treating the core material with earnest passion. I don't get the same feeling from a bunch of kung-fu Romulan spies throwing a bag over a woman's head after throwing her through a glass table, yelling at her to tell them where some unknown macguffin is.

While it would be nice to see a nugget of something appealing wedged into Picard, I haven't been able to see it. Not in the coverage, not in the promos, not in any interviews I've come across. Saying that, I don't mean to disparage anyone who did enjoy the show - I actually want to hear what you have to say. Maybe I've been blinded by a vocal minority, and there's more about this show that I haven't been hearing about that ties it more closely to TNG - I would certainly love for that to be the case.

To give some perspective on how I might be turned around on this, I'm a big fan of Jodie Whittaker's Doctor Who run - the material isn't always the best, and some of the episodes like Orphan 55 really do scrape the bottom of the barrel, but the Thirteenth Doctor is a constant highlight of the show and she carries even some of the weaker episodes of the show imo. I'm not a stranger to enjoying something that's critically maligned by a faction of its fanbase that claims it flies in the face of everything the franchise stands for. If there's something that the popular discourse around Picard almost always seems to leave out, I would genuinely like to hear it. It doesn't feel nice writing off a show that you're interested in because the reception to it is as toxic as it is.

While I'm open to changing my mind, I can't pretend that the negative criticism hasn't had a solid point or two. Some of the plot points - or at least, how they're being framed in their negative criticism - really leave a lot to be desired. Even if I end up watching the show later on, I think I'm gonna be glad that I left it alone until the first season ended - because waiting for new episodes in the tumultuous environment that Picard and Discovery has created within the fanbase would be an incredibly draining experience.

60,I want to see a Trek series set in a universe where Humans are small fish in a big pond,1589878841,"Not like ""Enterprise"" where we started out as the junior partners and quickly took what's apparently our rightful place at the top of the food chain, in a position of leadership of species which had been spacefaring for generations before us, like... I kind of want to see a Trek series written about Humanity *actually* exploring new areas, and finding that we're almost always technologically inferior to the civilizations we find.  


I feel like the Original Series did that sometimes, but since then it's largely been smooth sailing for humanity. We always have the best luxuries, the best equipment, the finest, fanciest tech, and in the rare circumstances where we don't, we quickly acquire it. I want to see a series where, say, we explore the B quadrant or something, and everyone there is just way ahead of us; so far ahead of us that they basically have to use their own Prime Directive to justify not giving us their technology.  


I feel like a lot of what I like in Star Trek happens when humanity doesn't have the ability to arbitrarily decide how a situation should be resolved; situations when humanity is forced to rely on ingenuity, diplomacy, empathy, or resolve an ethical question rather than using our technological superiority to control a situation to our advantage. I know there's isolated instances of this in a lot of the series, but it seems like \*on average\* humans are consistently on top, or at least masters of their own domain, in every series except the first few seasons of Enterprise, and some of TOS, in which you never know if the next planet will be advanced, parallel with the Federation, primitive, uninhabited, or inhabited by literal Gods.  


It'd be nice if we weren't always the benevolent colonial intrepid explorers for a while in the show, spreading our great and powerful technology to the less fortunate. Of course, I also haven't seen Discovery, so maybe things aren't like that anymore... I should really get CBS or whatever it is, and watch Discovery, then see how I can watch Picard...

91,DS9 - Way of the Warrior and The Visitor,1589861251,"I just rewatched these two episodes for the first time in over 20 years and was blown away at how well they hold up. Way of the Warrior really highlights a lot of DS9 strengths - from the relationship between Sisko and Yates which was building in the latter half of season 3, to the strong supporting characters in Garak and Dukat, to a great introduction to Worf (and people actually listened to his advice unlike on TNG!) and the continuation and creation of plot threads.  I just loved it!

The Visitor - I didn't expect to tear up like when I first watched it, but I did. Cirroc Lofton, Tony Todd, and Avery Brooks give phenomenal performances here.   

I've often said that DS9 feels like the more ""lived in"" world to me out of all the Trek shows and the characters feel more like ""real"" people.  As the rewatch continues, this becomes more and more evident.

92,"So people dislike Discovery, How long have you disliked the latest show?",1589861250,"I'm a new fan of Star Trek. Tried a few years ago with TNG and it felt too dated to hook me, but Discovery hooked me and now I am going back. I've seen some movies, some TOS, some TNG and some VOY, I am waiting on DS9 until I get to that place in TNG.

I've learned about in-universe timelines, alternate timelines, parallel timelines, and publication/release timelines as part of my fandom, but there is another timeline nobody talks about. The Fan-opinion timeline.

Let me know if I got this right.

* Right now most fans do not like Discovery, because they feel it violates canon and because they do not like the plot or the characters. But Enterprise is considered underrated, while older series are classics against which the more recent series are measured and found wanting.

* Before that fans did not like Enterprise, because it was boring and didn't make sense and was two political. Voyager was underrated, and DS9/TNG was the rule against which Enterprise was judged and found wanting.

* Before that we didn't like Voyager because the captain was unlikable and it was Gilligans island in space, but DS9 was underrated as a legasy of TNG and TNG/TOS were classics.

* Before that we didn't like DS9 because it was boring and they never left the space station, and could never life up to the awesomeness that was TNG.

* Before that we didn't like TNG, because Star Trek was supposed to be about Kirk Spock and McCoy, and a greater cast would never be developed (even though it was, in the alternate timeline, movies and we didn't like it)

* Before that we didn't like TAS because it wasn't TOS

* Before that we didn't like Star Trek because it wasn't ""Wagon Train""

It bothers me to look at Odo's face. Sisko puts enough emotion into his voice, but he has the body language of a cinder block. Dax is basically the same way. Kira is pretty cool.

17,Opening hailing frequencies.. (with some OC),1589857466,"Hi all, I have been a lurker for a long time but wanted to say hello as a life-long Trek fan. 

Voyager remains my favorite series, followed by TNG and then DS9. It's a such a narrow margin for all, especially VOY and TNG, but Voyager wins out for two reasons:

\- it was airing when I was the right age to watch it and appreciate it

\- it had characters I identified with more growing up, and was more science-based

\- It was thought provoking and had more frail, human characters. 

I know almost every Voyager episode by heart, and most of TNG, with my appreciation for DS9 growing as I age. TNG I didn't really have access to unless I was home from school sick and caught it on syndication until I got them on DVD.  DS9 didn't hold my attention as well as the themes were a bit more adult, and I hadn't experienced most of what they dealt with on the station at that point in my life. I find myself catching up to it as I get older.

35,"""The Enterprise Incident"" - First Time Viewing Reaction",1589849841,"Noob Trek 57 - The Enterprise Incident

Last week on Star Trek you thrilled to the thrilling thrills of Spock's Brain! This week, prepare yourselves for... Kirk's Eyebrows! Getting back to the actual name, The Enterprise Incident is an odd title - isn't every episode an incident involving the Enterprise that could be referred to as such? It's a bit anonymous. The Cloaked Heart or something might have been more evocative.

We're not wasting time, immediately being told by McCoy that Kirk is losing it- he must be because the medical officer has to do the intro. The distance from Kirk caused by McCoy doing the intro is crucial, it causes a lack insight into what Kirk is thinking, and this creates crucial dramatic tension. Will this be a story about space madness and Kirk's ego, or he is totally in control and executing some scheme? This is tied together by a strong performance from Shatner, particularly for the first half when we don't know what is going on. KShatner is keeping his cards close to his chest, keeping us guessing, What is Kirk up to? Has he gone mad? Has Starfleet ordered him to do this or is he doing it on his own steam?

The reveal of the Romulan commander as a lady person really wrong-footed me. Rather than seeing it as a bold move for gender equality, I rolled my eyes, thinking ""Oh god, they only did this so Kirk could boff her. Well at least this week's victim is his age for once."" A full discussion of this character, including why I'm calling her ""this character"" can't really be had until episode's end so it will come at the close of this pose.

It took me a while to realise that this episode is really about Spock. I was focussed on the ""crazy Kirk"" thing and didn't really notice the shift to focus on the dynamic between Spock and Commander until it was already well under why. It begins with some nice sparring between the two:

Commander: It is unworthy of a Vulcan to resort to subterfuge.

Spock: You are being clever. That is unworthy of a Romulan.

Ouch.

This is quite a dense story, and not in the way that Spock's Brain was dense - I mean it requires some unravelling. I almost needed to say some of it out loud to myself. Initially I thought Spock was dupe and only Kirk was aware of the plan, but then it clicked that Spock was in it from the beginning, which at once makes the story less tragic for him, but also reveals the coldness of his devotion to Starfleet which is at once admirable and disconcerting. Furthermore, initially I said - wait, why bother setting up Crazy Kirk as a fall guy so that the Federation wouldn't be blamed for the incident when they were going to brazenly steal the cloaking device and run off with it on Starfleet orders, meaning they would get blamed anyway? Oh because that way the Romulans tolerated the Enterprise hanging out next to one of their cloaked vessels long enough to complete the mission. Interesting parallels with The Balance Of Terror - that episode clouded the issue of goodies and baddies, it was easy to see how the Romulan commander was not so different from Kirk. This takes things even further - the Romulans aren't hurting anybody (at least not in the confines of what we see this episode) and some jackasses come running into a neutral zone, upset everybody, then steal priority technology and abduct a commander. I know there's larger context about the Federation feeling that they need to understand the cloak technology in order to frustrate Romulan aggression and keep the universe peaceful, but the way the Federation just thumbs its nose at the Romulan's here makes them hard to sympathise with.

The face Shatner makes when Spock declares him ""not sane"" is the funniest thing I've ever seen.

Spock's Brain was particularly unkind to Doohan, so it's nice that this episode gives him a moment to shine and redeem himself. Doohan manages to sound in charge while he pledges obedience to Kirk. Kirk is visibly moved by Scotty's declaration which is a lovely moment. Speaking of Spock's Brain, this is a great recovery. It's almost like a different show. Much better writing, acting, tone all round, it's quite mature, respectable television. I was worried that Spock's Brain indicated some new ""wacky space adventure"" direction the show was pushing in to appeal to kids or something.

Linville is doing a good job as the Romulan commander, very dignified and powerful. When I first saw the character I thought she was going to be some sex kitten for Kirk/Spock and I'm delighted to be wrong. Sure, she is a love interest for Spock, but plays it with dignity. The time frame in which she falls for Spock is implausible, but that's not the actress' fault. I was unsure as to whether she was really attracted to Spock or just using him to get to the Enterprise, seems it might have been a bit of both. She plays the Romulan character of being like Vulcans only without the dedication to emotionless logic very well. However, I hate the Romulan ship design with that lollipop thing sticking out the front. And these awful golden circle helmets. It's intriguing to see a good deal of the Romulan ship interior, we've only had one-room glimpses of non-starships before I believe. That don't do a lot imaginative however, pretty much of all it could pass for the Enterprise. It's probably the same sets with panels moved around.

The dramatic moment where McCoy announces that ""the captain is dead"" is ruined for me by how Kirk's corpse appears to be laughing.

AHAHAHAHA, the reveal when Scotty enters the sick bay and the camera tracks left to reveal Shatner in  his Romulan disguise, I'm on the floor. What a great out-of-context clip. See, this is a good episode, because it's had a few moments which made me laugh at it BUT they don't derail it a la Spock's brain. Despite a bit of goofiness this still holds together and its plots and themes maintain integrity.

This episode caused me to think a lot about Spock's feelings, which is ironic as he is supposed to the one without feelings. I also found it deeply funny that this episode tells us much more about Spock's mind than the one literally called Spock's Brain. It's interesting how a lack of character development sort of is character development for Spock. We expect these events to touch him, change him, perhaps make him angry or resentful or regretful, but no, he appears to be just fine with what he's done as long as the mission was completed. This would be unacceptable in a human character, but seems to be precisely what defines Vulcans as different, so the dramatic arc does a good job of defining their essentially different nature.

When Commander goes to slip into something more comfortable I became more uncomfortable. MOM! IT'S GETTING SLASH FICCY AGAIN! Mind you when she comes out dressed up Linville is pretty easy on the eye. But then it gets weird again with some really long finger rubbing fetish shot. Spock's into fingers huh? Now we know how he developed the flexibility to do that Vulcan salute. Spock does have the worst foreplay game in the world. ""I must confess that I too am moved emotionally."" That kind of shit will get you anti-laid son, you're gonna restore your virginity with those lines player.

How many Romulans does it take to screw in that lightbulb? Well it only takes one Kirk to unscrew it. It's a bit covenient that you can just pick up the cloaking device and hook it into the Enterprise, and seems sort of foolhardy of the Enterprise to gamble on a technology they don't know much about to be easily transportable and able to hooked into their Starship by Scotty in five minutes. Also why does it not occur to the Romulans that the device was ported aboard the Enterprise? And Kirk's eyebrows are funny every time, every new shot he's in get's me giggling.

So we come to the end. They've ruined this woman. I feel sorry for her. Previously I might have wondered if there would be some follow up to her fate, but I've learned now this show doesn't do that, so I'm sure we'll never see her again. Would she be put in some prison? Released back to the Vulcans? But what would they do to her after she lost the cloaking device and got herself captured? This is probably the best romance plot we've had in TOS so far and it involves the unemotional one. I think it's a writing issue - Kirk's conquests often feel very carelessly tossed off by the writer, either to provide eye candy or to appeal to Shatner's ego, whereas this relationship really matters to the episode and has had much more thought put into it as a result. And now the reason I call her Commander and ""this woman"" is because she isn't named. (A google tells me a recent Star Trek game gave her the canon name Nevesa but I prefer not naming her.) Now why was this done? It isn't incidental, as lampshaded by the scene in which she whispers her name to Spock and the audience is never told it. There's clearly writer intent to leaving her nameless. Is it that she's just a cog in the machinations of Starfleet, that Spock doesn't care who she is, that she's just going to be disposed, another victim of war? I dunno, but it's profound.

Solid stuff. Kept me guessing, good acting and writing, intelligent, quality television that got me thinking, but didn't forget to have a bit of fun along the way with Kirk's stint as a romulan and some sexy times for Spock. Very good.",startrek,Kayfim20,False,/r/startrek/comments/gmef62/the_enterprise_incident_first_time_viewing/

I was watching deleted scenes from Nemesis online when I came across an extended version of the scene where Picard looking at the photo, except this one is longer and includes Dr. Crusher coming in and chatting.

 I'm using an official DVD in either a PS3 or upscaling dvd player. Now most other DVDs I watch with this setup are pretty good. I don't have many complaints. But for DS9 problems are just a lot more noticeable. 

I'm hoping someone has some tips on screen setting. Last time I watched DS9 I did with a different, smaller tv and through my computer. I didn't notice anything I am experiencing now and think it's mostly the screen size.

I recently watched Voyager throughout Netflix and had no issues. The other treks I've watched were in hd. I mostly watch hd, but lately I'm in the mood for older sci-fi like sg1, farscape, B5 so any tips would be appreciated.

68,Would you like to see old characters from ENT show up in 2258 and meet Captain Pike in Strange New Worlds?,1589818567,"In most of the older Trek Shows from the Rick Berman era there were often multiple guest appearances from characters that were established in previous shows, often bringing closure to their arcs they had before in the Star Trek Universe.

TNG showed us the destinies of TOS legends McCoy, Scotty, Sarek and Spock.

DS9 told some new stories with TNG icons Q, Gowron, Vash, Lwaxana Troi and Tom Riker. Worf and O’Brian even become regulars, while Picard showed up in the pilot episode. The three original TOS Klingons showed up as well and especially Kor had a significant final arc in the 24th century.

Voyager brought back Q, Barclay and Deanna Troi. And the Borg Queen from the TNG movie First Contact became kind of a regular. The two Ferengi who disappeared in an instabile wormhole back in TNG made a return as well.

Enterprise, because of its nature as a prequel to all the other shows, brought us a little bit of continuation to Zephram Cochrane and some Borg Drones from First Contact. And of course a Dr. Soong met Archer as well.

Discovery so far only brought us the comebacks of Sarek, Amanda, Pike, Veena and Spock from TOS (with different actors playing the roles). ENT was not completely ignored (Archer’s name popped up on computer screens and the Mirror Universe Empire still had control of the TOS era starship Defiant.), but there were no old characters from the 22nd century showing up in 2256-2258 ... yet.

Now it seems to be more realistic to root for a comeback by some of them in “Strange New Worlds”, because the Discovery literally has disappeared from the 23rd century- to continue their adventures 1000 years in the future. 

So what do you think? Would you like to see T’Pol, Shran or Phlox again in the 23rd century? Maybe even some of the humans from the ENT crew? Would you be interested in some kind of additional closure for Archer, Trip, Hoshi and Co?

Breaking Canon is a tough pill, but it’s not a deal breaker, since they can fix this down the line. The criticism is valid, but overblown and not as terrible as Picard.

The serialized format does not work for Trek. It doesn’t allow for deeper, thought provoking stories, because it would consume the entire season and become boring. This we’re left with an action movie. Moreover, if the story for that season is a dud, it makes it quite difficult. 

The mirror universe, for instance, was terrible. Out of all the probabilities, why would every single main character on Discovery Prime Universe be a major player in the mirror universe? It’s just ridiculous. 

If this was episodic, you would move on from the dud story and might be greeted with “Inner Light” as your next episode or “Timeless” as the following episode.

The show is also much too serious. 

The story in season 2 is pretty good, I’m not sure why there’s so much hate. Yes writing Burnham as Spock’s sister is understandably blasphemous to some, but I understand they’re trying to tie in TOS. I would argue that having a main character, regardless if they had written Burnham better (and re-casted), was a mistake.

87,Project Defiant: DS9 1080p Upscale of Season 2 Now Available,1589806732,"TLDR: DS9 upscale is here for Season 2. Skip all the way to the bottom for instructions on where to get it. We've opted to release it in 1080p thanks to all of your feedback from Season 1

&amp;#x200B;

Mods, please let me know if you feel this is inappropriate for the sub.

&amp;#x200B;

Season 2 is ready and looking great! We listened to your feedback from Season 1 (don't be afraid to yell at us when we hard-code black bars! Someone should be court-martialed for that!). This latest release is exclusively in 1080p to remove the hassle of the massive (and mostly unnecessary) 4K file size. We stand behind our argument that 4K is more versatile for posterity and  editing, but you guys are right that it's not really necessary.

&amp;#x200B;

A few key when compared to Season 1 :

* 1080p H265 instead of 4K file container
* Better upscaling results (as we said in the season 1 post, the earlier seasons don't take to the upscale as well as the latter ones do, but season 2 is a lot better than season 1)
* We corrected the aspect ratio! It's back to 4:3 in all its 1990's glory
* The black bars have been removed! For the glory of Kahless!
* We've been seeding the file for a while before making the announcement, so downloads should be faster
* A few comparison screenshots are included in a subfolder. We may include more in future seasons, but we already had to delay season 2 when we made the change to 1080p, so we didn't have much time left. If anyone here knows of any good software to compare two videos live (with a single scroll-bar) please let us know!

# Project Details:

&amp;#x200B;

Lately there has been a lot of talk about upscaling DS9. There are many people working all over the globe to accomplish this, each trying their own methods and sources.

Much like its namesake, Project Defiant is the imperfect, but sturdy, approach to the problem. We have directly upscaled all of Season 1 and 2 from MKV source files. The result isn't as perfect as some of the other approaches, but it's quick and available en-masse.

Don't expect the quality to be equal to that of a native remaster, but it's a huge step up from the originals. Also, audio synchronization is sometimes imperfect; this is due to the fact that the original source has a variable framerate that was common in 90's TV shows and had to be converted to constant framerate (CFR) prior to the upscaling.

We sampled episodes from each season, and noticed that seasons 1 &amp; 2 don't play as nicely with the upscale as the later seasons. The rest of the seasons will be uploaded as they get upscaled.

&amp;#x200B;

Technical details:

&gt;We're using Topaz Labs' Gigapixel AI for video (currently available for free in Beta, but will eventually cost $100 US dollars). This upscales the video without cropping, which makes everything take longer, but at least no information is lost. We now post-process every episode in H265 using HandBrake to minimize the file size and maintain aspect-ratio. Each episode is between 500 Mb and 1 GB, making Season 2 about 21 GB. The difference in file size between some episodes is due to the processing time dedicated to compressing the file in H265. We had to delay the release of Season 2 when we made the change to 1080p and so not all episodes received the same post-processing computer time. Nonetheless, they're all equally upscaled.

&amp;#x200B;

If you want to help:

&gt;Send me a direct message here on reddit. Minimum requirements for upscaling: Windows 10, GTX 1070 GPU, 8 GB of RAM. Unfortunately Topaz Lab's software doesn't yet support AMD GPU's, so it's NVIDIA or bust! Each episode can take around of 10 hours to process, depending on your computer, so make sure that the conversion process won't cause you any problems or get in the way of other things you need to do on the computer.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**How to get it:**

This is the tricky part. DS9 is the property of CBS, and we want you to show them how much you love it; so please buy it from a retailer before proceeding, only then will they consider doing a full remaster. You should never download any media that you don't already own. Furthermore, downloading anything from the internet can pose a great risk to you and should never be done without a VPN. With that being said, the upscale is available on a specific public torrent site. I won't mention which one publicly, as I don't wish to break any rules here. It is possible to find it on Google by searching ""Star Trek Deep Space 9 S02 AI Upscale 1080p (2020)"" (quotation marks included).

You're chasing a rogue changeling wanted for crimes by the Federation and during the chase they  travel back to 2020 and you accidentally travel back with them. You lost the changeling but you're able to pick up an anti-matter trail  which leads to Earth.

By the time you get back to Earth, you discover that you're in mid-2020 but the changeling covertly introduced a vaccine and a cure for the Coronavirus. The media broadcasts and communications you're picking up are reporting mass recoveries and massive rollouts of the vaccine. The Coronavirus  will be eliminated.

I'm going to change how time travel works for the sake of the plot and to make this  ethical dilemma possible. Starships in the early 25th century are fitted with a new technoloy known as ""quantum anchors."" Basically, as soon as the ship's computers detect a temporal or subspace anomoly (such as  parallel universes), the ship automatically deploys a quantum anchor in  its own reality (the Prime universe) so that the ship can travel back its own reality safely and easily. When it's a temporal shift to the  past, this allows the ship to travel back to its own present without any changes that have taken place to have affected it.

So your ship did the same thing in its pursuit of the changeling. You and  your crew can just travel back to your own present whenever and the way  the changeling has changed history in this reality won't affect your own. But you're curious to understand why the criminal did this.

You manually deploy another quantum anchor and travel to the future to see how this massive intervention has changed it. Without detection, you find that Earth never developed warp speed, the third world war was even more devastating, no first contact was made, Earth never reunited and  the Federation never came into being. It is now a Dominion colony and  Terrans are a third class species. It's totally dystopian to the prime  universe.

You travel back to 2020. Your chief medical officers says he can engineer a pathogen identical  to SARS-CoV-2 but resistant to the changeling's cure and vaccine and  will kill the same number of people that it did in the history of the  prime timeline, and will still be curable by the treatments and vaccines  that humans eventually discovered around the same time in the future of  2020. Almost like resetting the timeline back to its original state in a  way.

Some of your senior crew are completely against his as this directly murdering people but say this  timeline isn't ours so it's not our business and we should just leave  immediately.

1,Why is the Star Trek fanbase so scared of serialization?,1589766449,"Forgive me if I make any errors, as I'm a very new Star Trek viewer. However, I'm old enough that I grew up with episodic storytelling. I like it. It's good, and there's a place for both typed of stories. However, I fail to see what makes serialization so bad when it comes to Star Trek. Rather than an actual valid complaint, it comes off more like ""not muh Star Trek"" to me. A show can't stay the same way forever. I don't view serialization as a negative impact on TV, but rather an evolution of basic episodic storytelling. Having some degree of episodic nature, like many current cable shows (take early Agents of SHIELD or Doctor Who for example), is fine, but if that's not enough story holding them together makes them feel a lot like filler.

Of course, there are strengths to episodic storytelling, and I admire a lot of shows that use it. But to me the current stigma surrounding it in this community comes off more like a boomer wanting things to be like they used to than a genuine criticism. Because really, serialization isn't inherently bad, just different. After all, Deep Space Nine is a fan favorite series BECAUSE of its serialized nature.

This is not to say I don't have issues with Discovery or Picard. I see Discovery season 2 as a massive step up, but in both cases the first seasons have massive pacing issues and rushed endings, not to mention major failures in the writing department and, in Discovery's case, feeling a bit bland in its first season due to creative differences over Bryan Fuller wanting to make something, yknow, unique, which gives me sequel trilogy Star Wars vibes. Bryan Fuller, by the way, is excellent at intersecting episodic and serialized storytelling. It doesn't help that the entire franchise is basically under Alex Kurtzman's control, the genius who attempted to make shared universes out of Spider-Man and Universal Monsters movies.

But now Strange New Worlds has been announced and everyone is singing the praises of episodic content, which I don't think is fair. Your personal taste doesn't mean a show is bad. And otherwise I wouldn't call anyone out for saying something is bad if both nu-Trek shows weren't massively review bomber for having serialized storytelling. Yes, Strange New Worlds is exciting, but not because it's episodic. It seems to me like th Star Trek fanbase is stuck in the past and having trouble adapting to modern television. I'm glad there will soon be something for everyone, but as long as you can write a good Trek story, I'm not sure the format matters. After all, it did have a successful, long-running film series. And I'm not hating on anyone for disliking the new shows either, as I'm not a big fan of them at all, but the main reason that's almost always stated is ""it's serialized"", which I don't think is good criticism.

4,The Sheliak,1589765013,"With the announcement of the ""Strange New Worlds"" series I began thinking about how, in the 4th season of ENT, the writers created some of the most entertaining Trek episodes of all the series AND provided very well written backstory to other episodes in the Trek Universe at the same time.    


Since the new series is going to focus on Pike's command of the Enterprise prior to Kirk taking command we know the timeline will be set prior to 2265.  Pike was Captain of the Enterprise from 2250 to 2265 before being replaced by Kirk.   This strikes me as a fantastic opportunity to once again provide some great storytelling and some awesome lore at the same time.    


Enter the Sheliak.   


The Sheliak Corporate, as depicted in TNG 3:02 ""Ensigns of Command"", were a xenophobic, non-humaniod, alien race who last made contact with the Federation in 2255 (deduced from on screen comments and other data).  An extremely complex treaty, the Treaty of Armens,  was signed with the Sheliak Corporate sometime around 2255 and for 111 years they abstained from contacting the Federation until the episode of TNG.  It is heavily implied that the Sheliak are violently hostile to human life and are of technological parity with the Federation.    


Spock was assigned to the Enterprise in 2254 making the timeframe possible for a potential story arc involving the Conflict with the Sheliak Corporate leading up to the signing  of the Treaty of Armens.  I think this would be pretty awesome as it provides a great backstory to a classic Data centered episode, it has the potential for some great pew pew scenes, and it's going to end with a great ""Star Trek Finish"" where everyone is going to get together and solve problems with words and written agreements instead of guns blazing.    


This could easily be a story broken up over an entire season with several episodes building up the tension before the direct confrontation with the Sheliak occurs.  The Enterprise can then be directly involved with the peace process with Spock flexing his first contact proficiency powers.

19,Hi I am a synesthete and I wanted to share a personal story about exploring the light and sound spectrum.,1589747966,"Hello I am a synesthete. I have visual snow syndrome, and I would like to share a personal story.
Hey guys my name is Cody McCarthy and I am a synesthete. I have visual snow syndrome which is very similar to synesthesia where you see colors or light flashes through some kind of naturally occurring extra sensory perception. I in fact and many others do see light static and colors in the dark with our eyes closed 24/7 not matter what u put up ur butt.... aka a strong remedy
I reached out to the synesthesia page and share with them the music network I created out of desperation when edm music began it was literally weeks after I took some lsd at a warehouse party on a gap year to London. Having Visual Snow personally I was hypersensitive to light and sound from birth without having the visual snow static. skrillexs music pushed into those xbox one fifa and racing games ruined my life I started to develop really awful horrendous body spasms from the music.
there people rasing money around this ""sickness"" cant take the time to talk about these people about perception and building a creative community is far beyond anything ive ever experienced.

I was warning the community of people with synesthesia that I currently don't have a creative or ""normal"" community of synesthetes to talk to and they are currently developed building personas around their ""sickness"".
https://soundcloud.com/cody-mccarthy
Also I would just like to address how people with synesthesia have always been encouraged to be creative and its been celebrated for what hundreds of years now as being normal, and how my community is not referred to as synesthetes.. but where its really crossing the line on exploitation is by researchers and trash media, that the condition of them being synesthetes is so extremes and unlivable they must collaborate educate and cure... I mean this is the slogan for the visual snow initiative, the way they fundraise money around this ""sickness"" and cant take the time to talk about these people about perception and building a creative community is far beyond anything ive ever experienced.
When my friend told me Russel Targ got banned from Ted Talks for talking about his research into ESP and how it was modern culture. I was shocked I live every single day having lights and colors appear in an extra sensory perception and your telling me im not living proof of a human having esp...!!!!??? like wtf people with synesthesia have always had ESP. I took it upon myself a few years ago to work with light and when I did something creative with it I wanted to share it with a friend who does music and he was the one who told me about what happened to Russel after we bagan to discuss why I was able to make a concept with processing sunlight refractions on one of my first attempts with basic photoshop.
https://imgur.com/gallery/vjpKFnU?
I have gotten a nice camera, macro lens, some nicer crystals and some clear opal but I think the toughest part for me is cutting light into a flower shape. That something that's been kinda difficult. I only get sunlight at my new place for a few minutes while the suns setting im gonna get a suncatcher to try out but its not ideal for being able to turn concept into an active creative process that would be considered a prolific project.
Well thanks for listening I hope this community can appreciate me sharing essentially a different way of seeing the world and I would share that with my concept work I made with light even though I personally find the images very cool. It was the sense of spirituality I got from it that really helped me accept seeing light flashes and colors. People in the group call it coping but from my point of view they haven't put near enough into coping and how that can result in a better quality of life. I just want to make sure I address this and let communities of people who may be interested that right now 2 % of the population is reported to have visual snow and you need to reconsider how edm music is dangerous physically and mentally for synesthetes with visual snow syndrome. Its matter of unborn people who would be subjected to suffering if I tell you about this or not through current developing trends in art and celebrity culture.",startrek,IceManxxxxx,False,/r/startrek/comments/glmw90/hi_i_am_a_synesthete_and_i_wanted_to_share_a/

Also, I'm a little confused as I was always under the impression that the Prime Directive forbade them from overtly interacting at all withe pre-warp civilizations, yet they seemed entirely fine with stopping there for some sexy Aryan shore leave. The Prime Directive only became a problem when deciding whether or not to rescue Wesley.

So I guess my questions are:

1.Does the Prime Directive forbid overt interaction with pre-warp people, or just directly influencing their developement?

2.How many times did Picard violate the Prime Directive?

I’m gonna say it: as much as I want SNW to explore new stories and not be a pure nostalgia fan service vehicle, this is a cameo I’d love to see:

Andorians live to around 130 or so, and if he made commander in 2142 at a young age (28? That was Riker’s age when he turned down a command) you can peg his birthdate around 2115. He’d be a little old (143 in 2258), but with Andorians having a longer lifespan than humans, it’s definitely not beyond the realm of plausibility.

And imagine: a episode or a small arc where we get to see where the Andorians have gotten to since the birth of the federation. Maybe it’s an excuse to introduce an Andorian crew member? What’s become of Andoria post Klingon war? Could there be a threat to Federation unity coming from a faction?

Or does Shran just join them as an advisor on a major mission to a newly contacted species, or to oversee war games with a deadly sabotage that undermines his legend only to be redeemed in the end, or whatever.

It’s a cameo I would love that offers a further exploration of a big Federation member, links the new shows to Enterprise in a concrete way and gives a powerhouse actor another role in the franchise.",startrek,fistantellmore,False,/r/startrek/comments/gllmw8/old_man_shran_for_strange_new_worlds/

“The City on The Edge of Forever” and “Star Trek IV” are widely regarded as good episodes/movie, both of which are time-travel based.

There are number of good paradoxes which need to be unravelled in TNG – Yesterday’s Enterprise and Tapestry comes to mind here.  In both, something is wrong or needs to be fixed to restore the timeline, much like in The Garden of Forever episode. – The movie, First Contact also is a good regarded movie and again, our crew are fixing a damaged timeline.

Deep Space Nine introduced us to the department of temporal investigations (a precursor to the Starfleet Time-Ships crew we later see in Voyager perhaps)? – I thought episodes like “Past-Tense” and “Trials and Tribble-ations” we’re wonderful, for very different reasons and ultimately, the adventure is our crew is embarking on, is restoring the timeline again.

There’s numerous Time Travel episode in Voyager and I think they really had fun with it right from its first – “Time &amp; Again” episode where they realise, they were in fact responsible for a time fracture and had to restore the timeline again.  My most favourite part of Voyager’s brushes with time travel is realising that “The computer age of the late twentieth century…” “…Shouldn’t have happened”.  \[Add more Janeway time infractions if you please, - there’s loads and it’s fun to read\].

Then there’s Enterprise which seem to indicate The Temporal Cold war could have been a a multi-season arc, it could have potentially been used as a platform for them to use characters from TNG/DS9/VOY and possibly even TOS characters including re-introducing tech from the 24th century since it was a prequal show. – (Not asking for that, but it would have been easy enough to include if it was a decent enough storyline).

In Discovery, Captain Pike comments “What the hell kind of communicator is that” after seeing Ash use it to contact his ship aboard the Discovery.  We’re yet to see how Ash got his hands-on tech from at least the 24th century – hopefully this will be explained in DISCO Season 3 or the upcoming Section 31 series.

My point is, Time Travel has been a theme across all of Star Trek and personally, I love a good time travel episode and I think a lot of fans do enjoy time-travel episode too.

What’s the reason for many fans disliking the Temporal Cold War storyline?  I’d like to see more of it in upcoming Trek.

40,*SPOILERS* Finally finished up DS9 on my marathon of ST for the first time,1589721195,"Thus far only TNG was my first completed series and now I have two down. I will admit the first two seasons of DS9 had me worried as I had no investment in any of the characters or what happened to the station as a whole. Only Odo was a character I actually enjoyed, mostly do to the fact that it was the same actor that played House in Fallout New Vegas and he was just a perfect subtlety funny character. It wasn’t really until episode 17 or so of season 2 where I actually started to get interested. 

From there it was pretty smooth sailing and I started to care about characters and what could happen to the station or Bajor. The Dominion was a perfect antithesis of the Federation and had them at every point which was so invigorating. At least in TNG most battles or anything were mostly one sided to either party but now in DS9 the battles were more even or we weren’t sure which side had the clear advantage. 

Both battles of retaking DS9 and the final battle over Cardassia Prime were so great. They were massive but not to the point where we couldn’t tell what was going on. My only gripe with both battles is: WHERE WERE THE SOVEREIGN CLASS SHIPS?! Sure they’re mentioned or on some LCARS panel but where were they physically? I understand it could have been a production thing where they didn’t have a low res model or something like that but cmon at least an out of focus glimpse cause those ships would tear ass. I need more Sovereigns in my life. They’re so great looking and are armed to the teeth. 

Overall I do think this was a great sequel series to TNG building on what they established and even making them better in some cases. I will say if I ever rewatch it I’m probably skipping the first two seasons up until the final few of S2.

53,Hard Time on DS9,1589690870,"I’ve been going through a rough, messy breakup with someone I love dearly.  It’s been hard.  It’s actually been totally devastating.  I’ve been a wreck.  I yelled at my assistant this morning via Zoom and said all sorts of terrible things to her.  She cried.  I apologized. She is still hurt. I fumed.  

Right around that time “Hard Time” was playing on my continuous rewatch of DS9 while I work from home.  Sisko sat O’Brien down and told him to get some help or else. He might as well have been looking me in the eye when that scene played.  I realized I was out of balance.  I realized I needed help.  

When O’Brien held a phaser to his chin I just started bawling.  I’ve served and been in combat situations before.  The guilt you feel is overwhelming.

Another thing, about how Jadzia was killed and the Dax symbiont was given to Ezri. The choice of the writers to do this wasn’t that surprising, BUT to keep Ezri on the show as a main character still was genius. You become kind of attached to the characters and their deeply hashed out stories (especially anything to do with Worf) and you accept them as one being with one life just as everyone else does. But now even the viewers get to experience what it’s like to be in the life of a Trill two lifetimes.

56,I'm rewatching DS9 and have some thoughts on it vs. the new shows,1589685631,"I am one of the people that mostly likes both Discovery and Picard, although I do see flaws in each to a point.

Perhaps what is most disappointing about the new shows is that the limited episode count and singular storyline mean that we won't get episodes like Far Beyond the Stars, the Inner Light, or City on the Edge of Forever.  Those were all standalone episodes that didn't intersect at all (maybe Fay Beyond the Stars did just a little) with the rest of the series' episodes.  However, they were incredible episodes and are widely considered among the best episodes in the entire franchise.

There are small nods once in a while to trying to do this in the new shows (e.g. Discovery's New Eden, but only tangentially), but, while we get a story that spans a season, we're not getting those one-offs shows that make Star Trek what it is.

All that said, I'm eagerly awaiting Discovery Season 3 and a new season of Picard and am particularly excited for Strange New Worlds, which promises a bit more of the Star Trek we know coupled with the new stuff.  I hope that a limited episode count can ensure that Strange New Worlds gets DS9-like treatment - an incredible overarching story with the one-offs that will eventually be remembered as the greats.",startrek,otherscottlowe,False,/r/startrek/comments/gl8a00/im_rewatching_ds9_and_have_some_thoughts_on_it_vs/

I think I was a little turned off because many of the clips I watched were from later seasons which have a bit cornier dialogue. I decided to finally watch the show from beginning to end.

I realize now DS9 improves on some of the weaker aspects of TNG.  Outside of Picard, Data, and Worf,  I think TNG didnt have very interesting characters or arcs for the actors.  DS9 fleshes every character out with richly emotional backstories.  I also think overall there is more acting talent in the DS9 cast. Despite its ambition, the more limited TNG budget resulted in more bland less animated sets. DS9 fixed that with dozens of extras and more recurring characters to establish the atmosphere of a large bustling galaxy. And for the obvious one, DS9 took the franchise into the territory of a massive overarching and dynamic political situation all the while exploring darker and more emotional themes compared to previous shows.  Its peak Trek in my opinion. 

Picard will always be my favorite captain and TNG will still have some of the franchise's best episodes, but I can't deny that overall, DS9 was more emotional, thrilling, and memorable.

85,"In ""What You Leave Behind"", the music playing during the scene where Kasidy visits the Celestial Temple is the main theme from ""The Visitor"".",1589657188,"I originally wasn't going to dedicate a post to this, as I figured this was common knowledge; however, my efforts to find any mention of it online came up completely empty.

My *Trek* rewatch, with *TOS*, *TNG*, and most of the movies behind me by the time the new year rolled around, led me into a relative sprint through *Deep Space Nine*'s final four seasons. As such, I saw ""*The Visitor*"" and ""*What You Leave Behind*"" within the span of only a couple of months.

As anyone who has seen these two episodes knows, the former deals with Jake Sisko attempting to bring back his father, who is lost in subspace, over the course of decades; the latter is the series finale, within which Benjamin Sisko defeats Dukat, but at the cost of being ascended to the Celestial Temple, lost in a similar way to how he was in ""*The Visitor*"". However, after arriving there, he contacts Kasidy Yates, essentially giving her a prophet vision where she is able to spend a few moments with him before being sent back into linear time.

""*The Visitor*""'s music, just as with the music from ""*What You Leave Behind*"" and most of *DS9*, was composed by Dennis McCarthy. There's a main motif that plays throughout ""*The Visitor*"", usually in scenes where Jake is mourning his father. This same theme plays in the scene where Kasidy sees Ben in the Celestial Temple. I was completely floored by its' inclusion here, something I had never appreciated before because, even though I've seen this show before, I never really did so in a steady, linear watch like I did this time.

I figured everyone knew about this, seeing as *The Visitor* is one of the most popular *Trek* episodes. But I haven't found anything online about it. I can't imagine I'm the first to discover this. This is a variation of the piece of music in question:

15,Can we please stop the BNW hype train now!,1589627510,"Ok. All the Trek I watched as it first aired:


TNG - took 40+ episodes to get good.


DS9 - too dark &amp; wasn't Trek as you can't have Trek on a space station.


VOY - rebooted too much, had infinite torpedoes &amp; no character development.


ENT - Had a rubbish theme tune.


DSC\PIC - neither are even past S2. No previous Trek series has ever been at it's best before then, so not sure why haters exist for either series, yet.


Which brings me to my point. No Trek series has ever had a good S1. So will someone please explain the high expectations for BNW? It's only just been announced.


S1 will be bad in loads of places. Fandom will find a reason to hate it. There will be YouTube videos deconstructing every episode just in order to hate on it. 


This sub will be full of threads telling you why it's bad. And you'll all lap it up because you're all second guessing it &amp; building it up into something you want it to be rather than appreciating it for what it is. It can't meet all the expectations in this sub. It's actually impossible.


Every. Single. Time. What is it with Trek fandom that we've been doing this for over 30 years without ever learning?


Just let them make the show &amp; enjoy it for what it is, you'll all be less stressed when it's released that way!

16,So I'm currently binge watching TOS for the first time...[part 1] The sexism and heteronormativeness is hilarious,1589624479,"I've taken this lockdown as an opportunity to finally watching the entire original series for the first time. I've been a Trekkie since I was a child. I grew up on the TOS movies and I have memorised every scene and every line by now. I still have the VHS box set. It occupies a very special place on my bookshelf.

Only every once in a while did I watch an episode of TOS when it just happened to be on. We never had it on video and still never bothered to buy the DVDs or the blu-rays. At the beginning of this lockdown, I started watching DS9 for the first time. I finished it and it has become my favourite entry in the whole franchise but that's another story. I downloaded the remastered TOS but with the original visual effects. I wanted to watch it as it was shown back in the day. I don't really agree with the George Lucas-approach of preserving old sci-fi. Also, if I'm to ever travel to the US and visit the Smithsonian, I want to be able to see the very Enterprise model that I watched in the series.

Anways, I just got to season 3. I've noticed that when they started the movies, they decided to go in a different direction in tone. I already talked about how TOS can be very surreal, weird yet methaphorical in another thread.

I must say, I find the casual sexism and heteronormativity so funny at times. I'm not one to judge art from the past through contemporary values. I completely accept TOS was a product of its time and of very conservative studio execs. I'm not about to cancel it on the internet. If a new Trek series or movie was to be sexist or heteronormative, I'd be among the first people hating on it.

I just found it incredibly funny how the 60s thought the future was going to have the same rigid gender roles and gender relations and that women were just going to be pretty objects to look at who fall in love with men by just spending a few minutes with them.

The line I found the funniest in the whole series in this respect was from Spock in this scene from ""This Side of Paradise"":

&gt;*""SPOCK: Your plants grow, and you've survived exposure to Berthold rays.*   
*LEILA: That can be explained.*   
*SPOCK: Please do.*   
*LEILA: Later.*   
*SPOCK: I have never understood the female capacity to avoid a direct answer to any question.""*

I lost it. How that line was delivered. What made it even funnier was the Vulcans are meant to be a logical race, but sexism is a most illogical of concepts.

18,Walk with me though the hilariously inconsistent on-screen titles of Star Trek's two-part episodes.,1589612950,"Someone in another thread was musing about recently leaked episode titles for Discovery season 3 (**no spoilers** here, in case it's a real leak), and it reminded me that TNG displayed the titles of its two-part episodes on-screen in multiple ways. For example, the second part of “Redemption” is oddly called “Redemption II.”

So I got curious about the rest of them because I forgot which others did it that way too.

First, I looked up all the exact titles, *as displayed on-screen*, for each of TNG's two-parters, and then I did the same for *every other series*, and folks, you simply must follow me on this insane roller coaster ride (with a unbelievable finish) though the entirety of Star Trek history…

# TOS

**“THE MENAGERIE” PART I**  
**“THE MENAGERIE” PART II**  
Famously, TOS only had one two-parter, and it establishes a style that regards the “PART” part as separate from the title itself, outside the quotes. Unusual perhaps, but with a literary pedigree I admire. A sensible style convention, I'd argue.

# TNG

**""Encounter at Farpoint"" ???**  
**""Encounter at Farpoint"" ???**  
This originally aired as a single TV movie. I couldn't find a screengrab for either separated part, so I don't know how it appears. If anyone remembers, or has either a screengrab or their old VHS copies lying around, I'd be very curious to see it.

**""The Best of Both Worlds""**  
**""The Best of Both Worlds"" Part II**  
Okay, here we go. This is TNG's first actual two-parter. Note now the ""Part II"" is placed outside the quotes, adopting the style from TOS before it. The difference, other than dropping the ""Part I"" from part one, is that we’re not using ALL CAPS anymore, so we learn that “Part” is meant to be rendered in title case, with the “P” capitalized. A boring fact that you'll soon learn is *the only constant in the universe*.

**""Redemption""**  
**""Redemption II""**  
Okay, another season-ending cliffhanger resolved! But... now we're just naming them like heavy metal albums, I guess. The only actual established rule for TNG so far is that ""part one"" does not get a roman numeral…

**""Unification I""**  
**""Unification II""**  
...except now it does! Nearly the same except that pesky ""I"" Okay, I guess. ""I"" and ""II,"" simple, let's stick with that.

**""Time's Arrow""**  
**""Time's Arrow, Part II""**  
Nevermind! Let's go back to the first style... but... we're wrapping quotes around the whole thing now? I mean, we did that with the last two, so whatever. Surely, this is it. It can't change again, no way. Let's use this one going forward, forever...

**""Chain Of Command, Part I""**  
**""Chain Of Command, Part II""**  
Ugh... I thought we had something here! But fine, ""Part I"" can be called ""Part I,"" whatever, almost but not exactly like it was in 1966! Plus, hey, let’s capitalize words like “Of” now, even though we didn’t do that before, that’ll be fun!

**""Birthright, Part I""**  
**""Birthright, Part II""**  
TWO IN A ROW! Surely this means we've settled the matter for good.

**""Descent""**  
**""Descent, Part II""**  
Nope. I mean, it's another reused pattern, just a different one...

***""Gambit, Part I""***  
**""*****Gambit, Part II""***  
Back and forth, it seems? Okay, okay, I think get it now. Season-endng two-parters don't use ""Part I,"" but the other two-parters do. That’s the rule!

**""All Good Things...,Part I""**  
**""All Good Things...,Part II""**  
So close!! Hilariously, this is actually an entirely whole new style as a result of the odd **""...,P"".** Were extra spaces on the Video Toaster titler so costly in 1994? *(Of course, this only appears in the syndication cut, since it originally aired as a TV movie. Still, rules are rules!)*

# DS9

Okay, after a few years, you think they'd have figured things out, right? Well, not exactly. In DS9, there was never a season-ending cliffhanger where both parts had the same name, or was even ""part one"" and two of the ""same story,"" so it’s unknown what they would have done in that situation. But, there were plenty of two-part episodes, and they both did and did not follow the established rules.

Happily, all of DS9's *same-named* two-part episodes follow the format first used in TNG's ""Chain Of Command, Part I"" and ""Chain Of Command, Part II,"" which coincidentally were the last TNG episodes to air before DS9's premiered in January 1993.

Of note is that on DS9 and Voyager, like TOS before it, on-screen episode titles appear in ALL CAPS, which means that official titles, like “Way of the Warrior,” might have been capitalized differently on-screen if those crazy fools had been given the chance. After all, the episode which finally “establishes” the format used on DS9 had the temerity to capitalize the word “Of,” so frankly, all bets are off and nothing is real.

**""EMISSARY, PART I""**  
**""EMISSARY, PART II""**  
Of course, on home-media and in its original airing, “Emissary” was a single TV movie.

**""THE HOMECOMING""**  
**""THE CIRCLE""**  
**""THE SIEGE""**  
Another new style convention, the *multi-named multi-part* episode! This is Star Trek’s first three-parter, so I’ll give it a pass, although this is one that probably could have benefited from the existing convention, as an episode titled ""The Circle, Part III"" would probably be more commonly known as the history-making episode that it was.

**""THE MAQUIS, PART I"" / ""THE MAQUIS, PART II""**  
**""THE SEARCH, PART I"" / ""THE SEARCH, PART II""**  
**""PAST TENSE, PART I"" / ""PAST TENSE, PART II""**  
I guess we’re going back to what works, and we’re on a roll!! Three in a row! If not for ""The Circle"" trilogy, The Search could more accurately be the first multi-part episode to open a season of Star Trek.

**""IMPROBABLE CAUSE""**  
**""THE DIE IS CAST""**  
What the hell is this now!? We had a good thing going, Star Trek! I gave you that pass, remember? But this is a standard two-parter, what gives?

Of course, the actual reason for this is a great piece of behind-the-scenes trivia. Many assume that “The Circle” trilogy set this up, but the truth is that “Improbable Cause” wasn’t originally supposed to be a two-parter.

The script was expanded at the *very last minute*. The production and actor schedules were already set for the episode, as well as the next one, so they actually filmed ""Through the Looking Glass"" between parts one and two of this. All the materials, production reports, memos, scripts, etc, made no mention of “Part I,” so they decided not to change it (remember the rule about intra-season part ones?) and just gave “part two” it’s own title.

After this sweet taste of semantic freedom, *there are no further same-named two-part episodes* for the rest of DS9’s run.

**""THE WAY OF THE WARRIOR, PART I""**  
**""THE WAY OF THE WARRIOR, PART II""**  
Except *immediately* afterwards! Of course, this only appears in TV reruns. On home media, and as originally aired, this is a TV movie. I'll allow it!

**""HOMEFRONT""** / **""PARADISE LOST”**  
**""IN PURGATORY'S SHADOW""** / **""BY INFERNO'S LIGHT""**  
**""FAVOR THE BOLD""** / **""SACRIFICE OF ANGELS""**  
**“IMAGE IN THE SAND""** / **""SHADOWS AND SYMBOLS""**  
Now we’re talkin’, four (five by another measure) in a row! I mean, sorta. DS9 basically solved the problem of these inconsistent rules by not applying any rules at all. **I love you, DS9.**

**“WHAT YOU LEAVE BEHIND” ???**  
**“WHAT YOU LEAVE BEHIND” ???**  
The finale was another TV movie that was split up in reruns, nothing to see here. Literally, as I can’t find screengrabs for it. Although either way, if you view DS9's final 10-hour arc as a ten-part episode instead of a nine-part episode, this one kinda messes things up, but I won’t register that complaint because it’s not legitimate, so quiet you.

One can assume that when split up, it followed the convention for other same-named two-parters that has been well-established by now, but who's to say, since Voyager had established its own thing by this time and their TV movies presented some problems (read on...).

***NOTE: I am going to stop including TV movies where I can’t find the two-part title cards though, mainly because Voyager had a bunch of them.***

# VOY

How did Voyager handle their two-parters? Almost entirely consistently... just not using the convention eventually established by TNG and used DS9! There is one exception where they both *followed* yet still *broke* the existing rules, and another where they just hilariously flubbed it.

**""BASICS, PART I""**  
**""BASICS, PART II""**  
Okay, this follows the rules, right? Nope. “Basics, Part I” was the finale of season 2, and the one established rule for season ending “part ones” that *hasn’t yet been broken*, set all the way back in the first one ever, “Best of Both Worlds,” is that those episodes do not include any on-screen indication that they are the first half of a two-parter. Welp, so much for that…

**""FUTURE'S END""**  
**""FUTURE'S END, PART II""**  
What is this, opposite day? This is a two-parter that aired in the middle of season 3, so why does it get the “season-ending cliffhanger” approach but “Basics” didn’t? As a result, this is the first episode to break the *other* rule, that same-named part ones that air within a single season *always* include an indication of its part-onedness, as established in the first example, “Unification I.” Oh, fun.

**""SCORPION""**  
**""SCORPION, PART II""**  
I don’t know what to believe anymore. Scorpion is the season 3 finale, and according the new Voyager backwards way of doing things, it should be called “Scorpion, Part I.” Of course, that’s a silly thing to assume, but I’m role-playing a silly person here.

**""YEAR OF HELL""** / **""YEAR OF HELL, PART II""**  
**""THE KILLING GAME""** / **""THE KILLING GAME, PART II""**  
**""EQUINOX""** / **""EQUINOX, PART II""**  
Within a season, closing a season, whatever. It’s clear that Voyager has now picked a style and is sticking with it, five in a row. Kudos, even though it’s the *exact opposite* of what DS9 established for its same-named two-parters. Great work, everybody.

**""UNIMATRIX ZERO""**  
**""UNIMATRIX ZERO” PART II**  
Whoops! Someone was feeling nostalgic for 1990, or perhaps 1966! I’ll say it again, I quite like this as a title format, and I wish it was what was used on-screen for every multi-parter. This is the third and final time (across three series) that this style was used in all of Star Trek, although technically this isn’t the same as in “The Best of Both Worlds,” because Voyager titles are rendered in ALL CAPS, so really the only other time this format was seen was in “The Menagerie.” 🤣

**""WORKFORCE""**  
**""WORKFORCE, PART II""**  
Wrapping this up with a boring one. That’s the Voyager way, after all (ZING!)

*One last note regarding the TV movies, which Voyager had 4 of. All indications are that those episodes' “part ones” are labeled as “Episode Name, Part I.” This is how I've seen it in listings, but also, logically (not a safe assumption here, I know), it would be awfully confusing to viewers as well as for syndication TV programmers to have two episodes using the exact same name but one is twice as long as the other. So, I contend (without proof in front of me) that Voyager is likely as bad of an offender on this entire topic as TNG was.*

# ENT

We’ve made it to Enterprise! Goody. Not *much* to say here, but there are still a few oddities. We’re not back to using lowercase letters, but nearly. Enterprise used small-caps in place of lowercase, but I’ll format it here like a normal person, and also because Reddit doesn't allow small-caps (fair).

**""Shockwave"" / ""Shockwave, Part II""**  
**""Storm Front"" / ""Storm Front, Part II""**  
Following in Voyager’s footsteps, Enterprise doesn’t care if both parts aired in the same season or not, they’re not going to include that “Part I,” not even if you beg them to. Of course, as with Voyager, “Broken Bow,” the series’ only TV movie, likely has something different to say here, but again, I can’t find the potentially offending “part one” title card.

**""Borderland""** / **""Cold Station 12""** / **""The Augments""**  
**“The Forge""** / **""Awakening""** / **""Kir'Shara""**  
**""Babel One""** / **""United""** / **""The Aenar""**  
**""Affliction""** / **""Divergence""**  
Season 4 included a bunch of 2- and 3- part episodes, and **none** of them were same-named.

**""In a Mirror, Darkly""**  
**""In a Mirror, Darkly, Part II""**  
Just kidding! This one is also funny because of the multiple commas: *“Mirror, Darkly, Part”*. This one could have benefited from using the original TOS format.

**""Demons""**  
**""Terra Prime""**  
This one really should have been called “Terra Prime” and “Terra Prime, Part II.” In fact, I wish they’d have used “Part II” (and “Part III”) on *all* the multi-part episodes in this season (hell, I'd like “Part I” as well, but it’s too late for that now, children), All these years later, I never remember which episode is which among them, and a lot of them have really boring titles that would be better tossed.

&amp;#x200B;

^(Fhew!. Let’s take a 13 year break….)

&amp;#x200B;

# DSC/PIC

Oh, you thought we were done, didn’t you? Nope, there’s a little bit more title nonsense to be found in the new CBS shows! Of course, neither Discovery nor Picard show episode titles on-screen, which is a damn, cryin’, damn, hard shame (fingers-crossed for *Lower Decks* and *Strange New Worlds*!), so I’m using their official titles as distributed by CBS.

**“The Vulcan Hello”**  
**“Battle at the Binary Stars”**  
No problem here, technically, but of note is that this is the first Star Trek two-part episode to be originally filmed as a TV movie (meaning, a single production) but released in all forms as two episodes. I think “The Vulcan Hello, Part I” and “The Vulcan Hello, Part II” would have worked better here, but your opinion may vary.

Of course, what I *really* think is that this should have been a single feature-length episode. Your opinion is not allowed to vary on that, sorry. I make the rules now, because clearly no one else is interested.

**""Such Sweet Sorrow""**  
**""Such Sweet Sorrow, Part 2""**  
This one is interesting, because it’s the first ever Star Trek two-parter to end a season that isn’t a series finale (and also a TV movie). Like Voyager and Enterprise's inter-season two-parters, it omits the “part one” part in its part one, likely because the titles for Discovery episodes were only *officially* released publicly after the previous episode had aired, so there was likely some surprise intended here, similar to that of all of Trek's season-ending part one episodes (except ""Basics,"" which is basic).

The brand new development in titling here, and if we’re being pedantic (which we are), **rule break**, is that we’ve now dropped the Roman numerals in favor of Arabic numerals (the best numerals, it must be said).

At this point, nothing is sacred, so I don’t have any problem with this. However, it’s also a whole new production team at the wheel here, so importantly, it begins to establish **the new rules** regarding multi-part episode titles for the new CBS-produced shows, as this is the very first same-named two-parter.

But, Star Trek history has shown us that we can’t assume that *all* two-parters will be named this way, since like it was with the Paramount productions, there are likely as yet to be developed intersecting and cascading rulesets which will govern titles for future multi-part episodes. The only thing we know *for certain* is that two-part episodes which also serve as season finales do not include a variation of “part one” in the title of their first half...

The way he physically grabs her and she shuts down...the struggle (fear?) you can see in her eyes, the way she fights him...her screams of anguish when he double-melds her face and digs into the deepest parts of her mind...then the look of shock and vulnerability on her face when he finishes...and the look on *his* face, like he was burdened with the terrible thing he just had to do.

She's a Vulcan, so she wouldnt react to it the same way a human would...and I'm not saying that their actions werent justified or right under the circumstances, or that it actually IS rape, or that its wrong for all the reasons rape is wrong...but the way they played it really makes the scene about as close as you can get to a rape scene without crossing that problematic line.  And it makes the scene such a good point in Spock's story arc in the movie.",startrek,droid327,False,/r/startrek/comments/gkn85v/st_vi_valeris_interrogation/
26,"If Star Trek was to go back to its roots (TOS), on contemporary TV I think it would resemble something more like Black Mirror",1589596122,"It would be very little like the TOS movies, TNG and DS9, I think. I'm binge watching TOS for the first time (loving it by the way) and it seems that they went for a very different approach when they ressurected Star Trek in the 80s.

In the 80s and 90s, Star Trek resembled a slighly more realistic version of a space-faring future. Very allegorical to the times they were made.

TOS though, can get very surreal, weird, zany and metaphorical at times. It does feel like watching what an episode of Black Mirror would be if it were made in the 60s. There are conveniently a lot of parallel Earths and ""alien"" species that look exactly like humans. I know this was probably down to budget, time and a lack of technology but some episodes used this concept to good effect. I quite enjoyed ""A piece of the action"" and ""A taste of armageddon"" just to name a couple in those categories.

A new Trek series that would go for this approach would be a very bold move but if done right, I would absolutely love it. Wouldn't have to be set on a new Enterprise but another ship or a far-off space station or research facility.

27,Who is against Star Trek moving forward? (Into the 25th century),1589595335,"""Captain's log stardate 5374.4. The Enterprise's crew is finally studying the first star system of the ship's maiden voyage after a long trip since leaving space dock to arrive at the far unexplored reaches of the Beta Quadrant. The crew has so far discovered...""

In case you didn't know, I think since TNG, the first number of a Stardate corresponds to the century so this would take place in the 25th century. I don't know what the other numbers correspond to so I just made them up.

Now I can see on Reddit that the majority are all for the new Pike series SNW. And only a minority (myself included) are at least iffy about it.

My own reasons are that I am burnt out from prequels. I never watched Enterprise all the way through. Got bored a few episodes into the first seasons. The Abramsverse Trek movies were a massive disappointment. I could only enjoy them by trying to forget they had ""Star Trek"" in the title and consume them as mindless sci-fi action blockbusters.

It wasn't only because they completely lacked all the qualities which made me love the TOS movies so much, but the complete lack of continuity and compatibility with established canon. When I heard that a prequel movie was being made back in the day, I was extremely excited and interested to see how they were going to make the sets and designs of the 60s fit in with 2009's version of the 23rd century. I thought that was going to be a hard but interesting endeavour to witness.

Up until I actually started watching the movie at the cinema, I thought this was meant to be a faithful prequel to the TOS series. An origin story of all the senior crew of the Enterprise and how they met and got to know each other. I didn't read enough to know that this was actually a semi-prequel, a time travelling event into a seperate universe.

Then came the overboard visual changes to the Enterprise and the tech. I won't argue that it's perhaps a more realistic depiction of the future than the 60s and the 80s (although depictions of the future in 2040 might also look back at the 2010s and laugh at our own depictions). But because this is supposed to be somewhat the same universe (The villains came from the timeline that we had been watching from TOS to ST:Nemesis, and we also had Leanord Nimoy as Spock Prime), all the new tech just completely departed from what was already set before. It was far too distracting. I really wanted to believe that this was a faithful entry to Star Trek but I couldn't. I couldn't suspend belief for one second. It just felt way too different to even feel like the same franchise.

Then Discovery was announced. Yet ANOTHER prequel. But this time they said it was set in the prime universe so okay, I guess I'll be cautiously optimistic. Just a few minutes into the first episode, I was already facepalming. It wasn't just the grossly updated technology, but the completely changed look of the Klingons aswell. They made no effort to have that series line up seamlessly with TOS.

Again, I can somewhat enjoy Discovery as a standalone sci-fi space series. But I have to forget about the phrase ""Star Trek"" in the title. As just a series on its own, I found it entertaining. Wasn't as gripping as TNG and when I decided to start my DS9 journey, it went further down my list.

I tried hard to believe this could be in the same universe and timeline as pre-2009 Star Trek but couldn't. To me, Discovery is in a different universe. Feels much more like it's in the Abramsverse. I tried to imagine Captain Picard being a descendent of this series but couldn't. I could totally imagine Kelvin Kirk and Kelvin Spock making cameos in this series but it has its own Spock so obviously that can't happen. So logically, Discovery is probably in a third parallel universe.

That new episode of Rick &amp; Morty comes to mind.

Just the visual changes to the Enterprise exterior and interior alone confirm that this definitively cannot be in the same universe.

I keep reading a lot of these same complaints all over the internet about where Star Trek has gone since Nemesis. And I thought those complaints were heard once and for all when Picard was commissioned. It wasn't a great series. I'd rate it a 5 or 6/10 but we still have more seasons to wait for and every new Trek series always struggled or did very poorly in its first series.

And now we have the news of yet ANOTHER prequel series. AGAIN. I'm quite surprised at the overwhelmingly positive reaction to it.

Now, I will concede that I enjoyed Anson Mount-Pike. I enjoyed this Spock more than Quinto Spock. I will admit, the Enterprise looks cool, both from the outside and the inside. But I was really hoping that they weren't going to flesh out a whole new series from it.

You see, it's incredibly hard, if not impossible, to do faithful prequels to sci-fi franchises that are decades old (there are VERY few exceptions). If you are completely faithful, then it will be quite comic and unbelievable to modern audiences. Yes, I understand that a mid-23rd century Enterprise with plastic ""tapes"" on a show produced in 2020 cannot be done. But my question is, why keep going back? You're just going to screw up continuity and lore over and over and over again. You're going to tarnish characters' legacies either way no matter how hard you try not to. You're going to constantly get headache from fans pointing these inconsistencies out.

Most importantly, the franchise will suffer credibility and won't be able to compete with other franchise's that run a very tight ship (is that a pun or irony?), like the MCU. If you keep running around screwing up continuity, making prequels, quietly retconning canon, jumping back and forth, ignoring plot holes, explaining things away with incredibly far-fetched arguments, your franchise isn't going to hold up to scrutiny. Modern audiences are tough crowds in that respect and for good reason.

So why constantly write yourself into these difficult circumstances? Why constantly risk upsetting established canon? Why destroy it completely and needlessly polarise fans?

I can't think of any other alternative than to move FORWARD with the franchise to solve all these issues.

A new series with a new Enterprise and a new crew with a new cast. You keep your older fans, most of them anyway. Inevitably, some creative decisions would make some purists turn away but I think the majority would love a new generation. You gain new fans because it's a self-contained series.

And you can literally do whatever you want with the tech. Throw the kitchen sink at it. Warp 15 cruising speed?? Yup, very possible in the 25th century. Holograms? Why not. Quadlithium crystals? Sure. Fire-capable cloaking devices standard issue across the Klingon and Romulan Empires? Do it. An Alien civilisation with massive heads and sound like their mouths are filled with cotton buds? I look forward to it.

The possibilities are endless. Star Trek potentially has an infinite number of stories to tell. It is set in space. Literally an infinite frontier. And if you want to confine it to the Milky Way galaxy, I think the franchise has only revealed 10% of the galaxy at most. There are still mysterious strange new zany worlds to explore in completely uncharted reaches of the Milky Way galaxy. You have the potential to tell compelling entertaining sci-fi stories than can go as mainstream as Black Mirror and the MCU.

Isn't that what you want? Paramount/CBS keep doing prequels because somehow that seems to be what a lot of Trek fans want, as I can see from this Reddit about ST:SNW. Why though? Is the 23rd century the only century worth exploring in Star Trek? Are you opposed to go beyond the events of ST:Nemesis? Are you opposed to see the voyages of the Starship Enterprise-F/G/H etc? Are you not interested in the interstellar politics of the 25th century post-Dominion War/after the destruction of Romulus?

At dinner one evening in Archers cabin T’Pol is goaded into telling  a story (some true, some not, that’s what the others have to figure out) as Tucker and Archer do so often.  T’Pol tells the story of a Vulcan recon  mission fo earth to observe and report on the Sputnik launch which encounters an on board explosion sending the craft crashing into earth losing the ship, their captain and all their communications ability...with the exception of a faint distress beacon.  

The story is about how they must find a way meld into human society...or die.  It’s very charming.  It’s also important because as we know the canon is first contact was in Bozeman Montana many years later.  Is T’Pol telling a true story or fibbing?  

Anyway, here’s a few clips that may wet your appetite to view the whole episode.  The first one is actually a teaser trailer, I included it to show how Enterprise and it’s stars could cut up once in a while and laugh at themselves.  Enjoy, as I have over the years.

STAR TREK: REDEEMER

Star Trek: Redeemer takes place aboard the Starship Redemption, a deep space recovery rig that is more of a mobile operations station than deep space exploratory vessel. The Redemption is the ship they send to recover all the damaged, destroyed, and derelict starships left in intergalactic conflicts. It is the mission of the crew and captain to recover the weaponry, sensitive information and tech,  the bodies of the deceased, and even sometimes survivors of the vessels that cannot return to spacedock. It's the dirty job that most people in Starfleet don't want to do but still has to be done. Therefore, the members of the crew who are sent to work on the Redeemer tend to be individuals of Starfleet that may not be the best Starfleet has to offer but are sit considered valuable. It's a weigh station like a limbo where officers, ensigns, and others go to either redeem themselves in the eyes of their superiors or fail and are relieved of their duties. The specific era the show takes place within can be decided by which era the senior writers believe there would be the most battles to clean up after.  

While the overarching structure of the show is about the permanent and rotating crew, each episode's focus can shift based on the current task the Redeemer has taken on.

(for example) If it's mentioned in the opening captain's log entry that the damaged starship they're recovering/repairing has a breached warp core, the episode can shift to where the crew ""holes up"" in the holodecks to wait out the ""radiation bleedoff"" period and the episode shifts to where the crew members get to know each other better and backstory can be dropped to update the viewer about the crew.  OR, If someone on the recovery team discovers highly classified Info, tech, or secrets, Starfleet has to send an INTEL officer to secure the sensitive data which may or may not affect future episodes. (especially if the recovery person spills the beans about what was in the intel they might've looked at) OR, since the Redemption is a recovery vessel that is not equipped with weaponry, it can create a suspenseful situation if an enemy vessel arrives to reclaim a starship the Redeemer may have in its possession. There are many more possibilities but that's enough to give you an idea. 

In addition to the encounters, the stories about the myriad of diverse crew members and their reasons for being in such a place are enough to incite curiosity as to whether the crew member is there because of their mistakes or their attempts to succeed. But just because its a work vessel doesn't mean that's all that happens. There are episodes about new discoveries,love interests, personal triumphs, and since its a dangerous recovery effort, even loss. I have the notes for the characters and arcs for the entire first season and there are enough ""easter eggs"" and well rounded open situations to easily accommodate future seasons.

67,"""A classic Star Trek show that deals with optimism and the future."" | My sincerest hope they adhere to these words. Thoughts on SNW.",1589567956,"**Disclaimer:** This is my personal opinion. I understand that DISCO and PIC have their fans (for me personally, they did not deliver), and I really hope I love SNW when it premiers. I intend to give it every ounce of my good will and attention. I'm saying this with now, with no predetermined judgement, but based on all the past experiences with trek. Two things need to be true in order to truly foster my excitement. 

**1. It must be episodic.** At least mostly, it should still have longer arcs and throughlines like DS9, ENT, and VOY. And I believe the characters should evolve and remember significant things from past episodes (O'Brien would suffer from massive PTSD from all the shit he's been through, especially going to prison for 20+ years). But I really think episodic storytelling is extremely valuable to sci-fi. It allows writers to explore one-off ideas that may be less capable of supporting a huge story arc but are still worth exploring. Shows like Star Trek, Stargate, X-Files, Eureka, etc. were all able to explore fun and interesting ideas from a wide range of writers. Long arc storytelling is good for big weighty ideas combined with drama (Westworld, The Expanse, Altered Carbon, BSG) but they can't lean on the sci-fi aspect all the time and must become character-driven dramas more and more as they mature.

**2. Alex Kurtzman should not make any creative decisions.** I really believe that Alex Kurtzman has a different vision of Star Trek than the majority of the fanbase. He continually makes dark melodramatic soap operas that explore very few sci-fi ideas. Every plot he touches is the work of an angry evil bad guy that is driven by hate and fear. The stories he tells try very hard to appear to be complex and deeply emotional, but they do not do the hard work of earning it. They often rely on voice over or flashy large scale battles to give the impression of importance, but they are not.

Again, I am given hope by the words they used in the video: """"A classic Star Trek show that deals with optimism and the future."" I am looking forward to following this show as we learn more.",startrek,Eureka22,False,/r/startrek/comments/gketd4/a_classic_star_trek_show_that_deals_with_optimism/

Except his mind can't handle the new reality. So he becomes convinced that it's all a conspiracy. He continues his quest for the ""Truth"", and refuses to acknowledge that he's surrounded by aliens. He's convinced that everyone around him is wearing alien masks so much so that he has to be restrained on multiple occasions. He also believes that since the masks people wear are voluntary he can tell something about the people before he even talks to them. This has the unfortunate effect of making him seem really racist. 

He becomes convinced that aliens somehow have an agenda that they are pushing threw the Federation. What he can't see is that a certain amount of give and take is inevitable in such a broad government. He can't see this because he simultaneously believes that everyone is just people wearing human masks, and that anyone could secretly be an actual alien.

95,What is your favorite s Star Trek game?(including mods and fan games),1589552673,"For me it is,

5.Birth of the Federation 
It is a really good old time strategy game, and it would be higher if not for the bugs and memory leaks.


4.Legacy
I do like the battle mode in this game by the campaign leaves something to be desired(along with the fact that the game requires you to have a mod to access my favorite features)


3.Bridge Crew
I like VR games, I like Star Trek. The game is very fun, and I love being able to be part of a mission with other people instead of just being one person who does everything. However, after the TNG dlc, I don’t think they updated it and after completing everything there isn’t much to do.

2.Stage 9
You know how I said I liked Star Trek in VR? Well here is that again. A faithful recreation of the entire Enterprise D, with Easter eggs and activities, along with the ability to fly around DS9? Shut up and take my money! Oh, it’s free as well. I know this isn’t exactly a game and is more of a museum of sorts, but honestly they put so much effort into this. It not only takes things from the show, it takes things from the manuals. 9 forward? There. Battle Bridge? There. Shuttle bay? There. Man I just hope they continue and add things like DS9...wait what do you mean they have been cease and desisted by CBS?

1.Star Trek New Horizons 
This is the reason I included mods. This game is amazing. Tens upon tens of races, even if they only showed up for one or two episodes. Different eras starting at Enterprise and ending at TNG. Several events from the show. What more could I want. Oh, and two things. 1.it is free(well as long as you have Stellaris) 2.Its still getting updates! That’s right, it is still getting updates. I believe they added stuff for the mirror universe and have managed to keep it updated for the massive amounts of Stellaris updates that happen.

Finally made it through every episode and movie. Was dreading watching Nemesis, but we decided to be good completionists and make it through to the bitter end. 

We were pleasantly surprised by how much we enjoyed it! It wasn’t perfect, but it was better than we expected. Perhaps this is simply a function of going in with extremely low expectations, but I’ll try to describe what I enjoyed:

- Will and Deanna finally getting together warmed the cockles of my heart. :)
- Data’s send-off was brief and sudden, but I was touched by how the crew seemed overcome with emotion and had trouble finding the words to say when they met together to remember him. I wish the movie would have lingered here longer to give the audience the chance to fully say goodbye to Data. But it was not as bad as I was expecting.
- I was expecting to be bothered by the fact that the antagonist was a clone of Picard. However, when compared with many of the cheesy plots from the TV series, this idea was not that bad. Picard had to face his potential for darkness and evil. Caught glimpses of this in First Contact, and it was interesting to explore a bit further. 
- I liked the idea of Remus, a dark prison world where the inhabited side is always facing away from the sun. Seemed brutal enough of a place to raise a vengeful version of any person, even someone as righteous as Picard. 
- The space fighting was fun.
- I was also expecting to be bothered by the dune buggy sequence on the planet. However, when compared to the the over-the-top action of the JJ Abrams movies, I found the buggy sequence to be somewhat more tame. Didn’t love it, but I didn’t hate it. 
- I was expecting to dislike Tom Hardy’s performance as the antagonist, but I didn’t. It was not the most compelling performance of all of the Star Trek villains, but I found myself enjoying his portrayal in several scenes, like their dinner together. Was also fun to see Hardy as a young skinny guy, pre-Bane. 

Overall, I enjoyed Nemesis way more than I expected to. Not number 1 on my list, but not at the bottom like I’d expected it to be.

17,"TOS S2E5 ""The Apple"" - This one is underrated",1589509620,"This one seems not to get a lot of love on this subreddit, on imdb ratings, or other internet reviews, but I think there are some deeply philosophical, humanistic, subversive messages in this one.

The story of Adam and Eve had parallels in mythologies of other ancient civilizations besides ancient Israelites. While the Christian/Jewish interpretations of this story focus on the ""original sin"" of the act of eating the apple, there are other, more literal and less moralistic interpretations. The apple, the ""knowledge of good and evil,"" symbolized humanity's birth. It was an ancient myth about the the moment humans became something different than the animals we evolved from. And of course, with the knowledge of good an evil and right and wrong, was a loss of innocence and a birth of greed, evil, and other negative things. But there was also a birth of humanity's virtues, curiosity, ingenuity, etc.

The only humanistic view on Adam and Eve is that eating the apple was right and necessary for humans to evolve. Yes, if they never ate that apple, we'd be frolicking around naked in the garden eating berries, but we'd be God's pets, not truly human at all, like the natives worshipping Vaal in this episode. I am past my phase of angsty teenage atheism, but the modern religious view of Adam and Eve is deeply frustrating to me as I think it literally teaches the exact opposite message of what's right and true. Satan was in the right here, and the ""joke"" at the end about how Kirk was Satan is a subtle acknowledgement of that, it's a wink and a nod without being too aggressive for 60s TV. I think this episode is quintessential Trek philosophy and I give it a high mark.

Spock and McCoy's debate add another philosophical layer. Is it right to force Adam and Eve to eat the apple? Or should the be left alone to figure it out for themselves? Some of the earlier discourse on the prime directive.

54,"""Spock's Brain"" - First Time Viewing Reaction",1589461221,"Noob Trek 56 - Spock's Brain

Alright! Man am I psyched for this. I hope this suuuuuuuuuucks.

I'm not trying to be a dick, I've mentioned several times that I am a genuine fan of bad movies. Now that's not why I'm watching Star Trek, it's actually been pretty good right from the beginning. Good cast, good effects for the time, decent writing, some really imaginative plots and concepts. Yet I can't resist a good trainwreck, and disasters like The Alternative Factor and The Omega Glory had me rolling in the aisles. I wouldn't want the show to be terrible on a regular basis but come on, you know how every now and then one of your buddies does something bone headed and you rib him mercilessly about it? Well long running TV shows are like friends to us to, and it's a similar dynamic.

I did not seek out spoilers, but multiple times a commenter in a thread has said something like ""Well at least it isn't Spock's Brain"" and I even had a real life encounter with a trekkie at work; upon telling him I was watching TOS from the beginning, he was like ""MWAHAHAHAHAHA SPOCK'S BRAIN."" It's a shame, because these things shock and affect you the most when you don't know they're coming - this is precisely why I was so appalled by The Alternative Factor because I had absolutely no idea of its reputation, and it just threw a bucket of ice water over me. Had I known beforehand I may have sat there going ""Well this isn't THAT bad, come on guys"" because hype alters expectations. We'll see if that happens there.

Something's wrong right away: the title. It's not as if an episode about Kirk shooting people would be called ""Kirk's Index Finger."" (I'm sure someone out there has written the fanfic sequel ""Uhura's Ass"".) I already know from comments that someone steals Spock's Brain, hence the title, but why not The Brain Snatchers? The Mind Bandits? Intellectual Property Theft? Wait that's a bit too clever. But making it artless and prosaic and just dumping an item from the plot unceremoniously in your lap with the title like that suggests someone didn't care. Imagine if Citizen Kane was called His Sled. I even know that the band Spock's Beard briefly considered being Spock's Brain before deciding that might be interpreted as calling themselves shit.

Anyway \*rubbing hands, cracking open fresh pack of chicharrones\* here we go.

Wait what? That's not the Enterprise! Why are we watching a cyborg cruller flying through space? The cruller's occupant beams aboard the Enterprise, and it's Star Sapphire! The way she puts her hand on Spock's head it makes me think she was more interested in his hair. ""Spock's Bowlcut"".

Immediately I notice how minimalist and plain this dialogue is. It feels like placeholders. If the story I learn later about writer Gene Coon leaving the show at this point, and Gene Roddenberry also checking out is true, maybe it is. But what makes things so funny is the mismatch of the half-assed, no-effort dialogue with the cast's deadly serious reading of it. Can you imagine what the table read for this was like?

Kirk: We'll have to take him with us.

McCoy: Take him where?  
Kirk: In search of his brain.

This was my first real laugh of the evening. More follow.

McCoy: Where are you going to look for Spock's brain?

OK I can start to see why this is so highly regarded. There's been no effort whatsoever in the script to make the characters speak as believable people and subsequently everything they say rings false. And whose brilliant idea was it to have that siren squawking all the way through this sickbay scene?

Kirk: We have been following the trail of the spaceship that has Spock's brain.

It's funny every time.

But then we get the other side of the coin. Boredom. It's hard to be boring and crazy at the same time, but this episode manages it. The discussion about which planet the Brain Bandits went to goes on FOREVER. Come on, get on with it!

Down on the surface, we meet the natives. Oh man, these are the worst costumes yet. The leader is a caveman in a miniskirt and furry go go boots. I wish I was joking. And once again I think about how slow this episode is. The scene waiting for the cavemen in the rocks really drags its feet. I wonder if once again there were last minute rewrites and they're stalling for time to pad out the episode. Aside from their costumes, the cavemen also partake of the worst battle ever. It's pitiful, the way one falls over terribly and the rest run away. AND YOU DON'T THROW CLUBS.

I like when the caveman explains that the givers of pain and delight are the people that come and give pain and delight. ""The Givers Of Pain And Delight"" might have been a good title, but on second thought those slashfic writers don't need encouragement. Ahh, they have no women down here. That's why it's this guy's turn in the miniskirt tonight.

Then brainless Spock appears. Poor Leonard Nimoy, you can see him dying inside as he's forced to suffer through these indignities. I like to think that he wasn't directed to be still and expressionless in this episode, that fixed look on his face was just his natural reaction to what was going on around him as thought about his life choices. The absurdity of them standing next to Spock and asking his brain where he is gives me the giggles again. The episode starts to take on an amateurish tone. I can feel that Shatner and Kelley know they're in a turkey, they aren't giving it their all.

Line of the episode: ""Bones.... Scotty.... Spock's brain \*profound hand gesture\* controls."" Another favourite: ""We came to put you back into your body. We brought it along with us."" Ahahahahah.

What is wrong with Scotty's hair? And he seems so alarmed throughout the episode. Seriously, Doohan keeps looking like someone stuck a popsicle up his ass. He wasn't doing this last season, what's up with him? It's not a great episode for him - in an episode jam packed with lameness, he may have the lamest moment of them all. The climactic confrontation with the villain is resolved by Scotty moaning and swaying a bit so Kirk can snatch her gun. Who wrote this? It's like improv.

And suddenly we're all aboard for sexism town as Scotty holds forth about how women can't do anything and Kirk notices those delightful ass...pects. And Spock sitting still and silent through the fight with the guards is the funniest thing.

""You can remove a brain, therefore you can put it back in!"" What logic is this? You can smash a window, surely you can make all the pieces fly back together!

Man they've been standing in this dining room forever, come on.

I'm shocked to learn Gene Coon wrote this. He's been a great writer for Star Trek. I assumed it was some clueless noob. (I did some reading later and apparently Coon was departing under unhappy circumstances. This script has been interpreted by some as Coon giving the finger on his way out the door.) It's so vaguely defined and poorly explained and brrr, what is this stuff about other ways to control men? And where did the prime directive go? And it's derivative too. Though it is quite funny how Spock starts summarizing it at the end. Let me see if I can sort this out. Year ago this super civilization developed underground, and separated men and women into different dwellings, Men went above to hunt, women stayed below to be fragile women. Having all the technology, they used it to subjugate men while they became and idiotic and useless, what with machines doing everything for them. Therefore every ten thousand years they emerge from captivity to find a male brain capable of running the city for them. Man this is sexist. But how did the teacher know who Spock was and where the Enterprise would be at the time?

Interesting episode for McCoy. His willingness to sacrifice himself to save Spock is one of the few good things about the episode. It's quite touching and Kelly handles it well. Unfortunately he slips right - the way slides out of the Teacher helmet has me in stitches, then his ludicrous surgery faces show he won't be out over-acted by anyone. And all in the context of Spock talking a doctor through reconnecting his own brain with a laser.

Ok, well that was actually the best episode of Season Three so far! Seriously though, it was bad, but I still say Alternative Factor is the king. This is probably the third worst episode after that and The Omega Factor. This was poorly written and boring but it didn't have me screaming at the TV like The Alternative Factor nearly did. I totally get why it's hated though, there's a lot wrong with it, and it fails to make me care about it. It rehashes some old man and machine stuff we've seen before, and attempts to pep it up with I Mudd style goofiness, but the comedy just isn't there, at least not intentionally.

61,Why I like TNG,1589435864,"What I liked about TNG is it showed us what humanity was capable of if we allow the best of our qualities to flourish. It didn't fetishize these qualities. In Marxist language, a ""fetish"" is when you apply human qualities to inanimate objects. Ancient people carved out gods out of stone. They then said that stone possessed powers, human-like powers, like feeling love or hate. But on TNG, it shows the best qualities humanity has to offer are instantiated in humans, not some god or fetish. TNG really shows us a future We could actually have one day if we just allowed those qualities to govern ourselves. 

Science isn't an end in itself, but the pursuit of knowledge is the end. When I mean the pursuit of knowledge, I mean ""knowledge"" in the way Plato meant it; the Good. The Good is beautiful and moral, not just instrumentally useful. To pursue the Good, we must not fetishized science. The humanities and the arts play a role here too. What good is physics without also having theater? What good is engineering without philosophy? Picard exemplified this well. He was an explorer, an explorer of the physical universe; he was materially grounded. He was the captain of a ship that represents the shear power and terrifying potential pure scientific knowledge can produce. But he loved spy novels and Shakespeare. He was also a man of the humanities, and fascinated by archeology and other cultures.

This humanism, this idea of flourishing in both spirit and body, is universal. Every alien race in Star Trek is capable of these good ""human"" qualities as well.

67,Trills,1589429910,"As some fans may notice the Trills designs on DS9 look similar to the Valteese and Kriosian on TNG. I haven’t read any book YET and it probably wouldn’t fit into Picard, but would be interesting to get background info on the Trill redesign because Jadizia and Erzi look way different than Crusher’s lover. Be interesting to see in the books that maybe it was caused by a mutagenic virus or there are subspecies of Trill; TNG trill only make up 5% or less of the population. 

Back to the Kriosians and Valteese, I am thinking about how Romulans and Vulcans are all related. I think because of social issues about having symbiotes. Kriosians believe that you should only have one chance to live your life and that offspring should carry out one’s legacy, not some work.

88,Most hated character from Next Generation circa 2020?,1589402929,"OK. Thanks to Netflix AND Amazon Prime having the whole lot in HD, I have finally gotten into Trek NextGen. I had watched Picard s1 on CBS and afterwards thought, ""*where'd this guy come from.*"" Answer: the 2nd Star Trek tv show from 30 odd years ago.

Warp speed past watching the ""All good things..."" final episode, I gotta ask, **who do you think is the most hated of the characters on this old but interesting tv show**? 

I have heard Troi is the most hated, due to whatever reason morons hate her.  Her boobs are perfect.  I also understand Dr. Pulaski is a worthy of a meat grinder.  Personally, out of all the episodes I find the most annoying figure are episodes with Q. 

Yeah yeah, they were juxtaposing this omnipotent figure with humanity, in order not to show how bad we are, but in fact how far we have come circa 2385.  That's a good intention.  But it doesn't seem to work for me.  

First, we start with this obnoxious actor they chose, who only makes me think of that piss-ant Gould lackey from Star-Gate SG1.  I hated John de Lancie then and I hate him as an adult.  Maybe that is why his intention for being in STNG fails for me?

I also should offer dishonorable mention to Dr. Pulaski.  She is the first character I had NO IDEA why they added.  Where's that cute red head MILF?? I assume it is the same favor-casting they gave to Ensign Barclay.  These two zippies had to have been owed a favor to get where they landed.  How can you tell? Take the show, subtract these two figures, and ask if the show is missing something.  

I would miss Deanna, Riker, and Jorde, who are the other so called ""most hated"". But come on, if people somehow hate all of these characters, why in hell did the show ever last?? Data, and his quest for humanity is neat, but not that neat.  And Picard is only cool really because we wish to view him as being such.

92,"It’s been a rough few years, but I did it.",1589399024,"I never post only lurk, but I need to put this out there. Somehow. This place seems appropriate. 

About 4 years ago I decided I wanted to go back to school. I’d been a paramedic for about 3-4ish years before that. I was a high school dropout who got his GED a few years ago because I needed it to be an EMT (what I thought was my dream job and for a time it was). 

I was successful and became a paramedic after that. I’d been a field medic for about 3 years when I decided I wanted to live a better life and felt that I could reach higher goals. So I went back college in Spring if 2016. 

Six weeks later my ex-wife left me for another man and followed him to another state. It wasn’t anyone’s fault, we just realized after 5 years together that we wanted different things. I suppose that’s why she sought love in another. I wish she had told me something was wrong before hand so we could have maybe worked it out, but I guess the new guy was an easier way to go, but I can’t fault her for seeking something more in line with what she wants. I was lost but I figured when you’re lost you just remain persistent and keep moving forward. 

I had many set backs in college. I went back at 31 and hadn’t done any math besides dosage calculations in 15 years. So I had to take 2 math courses, one 5 hour and one 6 hour course over 2 semesters to get my math to a level that I could take the science courses required for my degree plans. 

In that time my father stopped talking to me, it’s been 3 years since he called me, but in all honesty, he’s bigoted and racist. I don’t tolerate his bullshit and call him out on it. Rationally I know toxic assholes are no loss, and to be honest the only things we have in common are 23 chromosomes, but it still hurts to not have a relationship with your father, even if you know he’s a bigoted piece of shit. 

This left only my close friends, my mother, step father and maternal grandmother. All were or have been very supportive of my educational and career goals. 

Spring semester of 2018 my step-dad went into the ICU and by the fall semester he was gone. I had to drive 3.5 hours in the evening to be there for my mom when she withdrew his care.  She’s very poor and doesn’t have much money, so after he died I drove her back home to the rural town she lives in and then drove 5 more hours to be at class that morning. 

She became severely depressed and after about a year she started seeing someone for it. I had hoped they’d finally be able to help her get healthy again so she could move on with her life. She’s 58 and had so many years ahead of her.

At the start of this semester she told me they suspected she might have a brain tumor and were trying to figure out how to get her help. Again she’s very poor and has no insurance and it’s taken several months of social work to get her to a neurologist who is treating her for free to help her get resources like Medicare and such. 

Well this morning I had a conference call with her and her neurologist after finally getting her an MRI to see where this suspected tumor is. Turns out she doesn’t have a brain tumor she has Lewy Body Dementia and she’s terminal. My mother is going to die as well. 

It’s been so fucking hard these last 4 years. The hardest I’ve ever faced in my whole lives. But even with all this bullshit that has happened I finally earned 2 associates degrees. One in biology and one in pre-nursing. If there had been a ceremony I would have gradated with honors with a 3.91 gpa (thanks COVID19). 

I took an entire year of physics and chemistry (together) to obtain the biology degree because I was interested in those subjects and I felt they could prepare me for my dream job. I want to be a CRNA (nurse anesthetist). 

Next semester I start nursing school and will obtain my Bachelors of Science in Nursing by the end of fall next year. It’s a program designed for paramedics to obtain I’m so excited to start this next step in achieving my goals. 

Just like 4 years ago when I started, life gave me a huge curve ball and keeps throwing them at me now, but I’ve come to learn that the obstacles in our path define the path, and it’s persistence and perseverance over those obstacles that leads to success. Nothing has stopped me and nothing will.

7,A more balanced evaluation of Kurtzman's era.,1589375786,"So, this particular post I will keep 100% apolitical. Like good old Judge Dredd, I will evaluate it based on  non-polilitical standards.

Firstly, I will say that I understand that I do not make Star Trek. But I also know that fan evaluation is totally fine, even if it's critical. Zack Snyder's Man of Steel was despised by Superman fans because Clark is supposed to be the embodiment of hope, as he has been for almost a century. But he was not hopeful in MOS, he was dark and gritty and not hopeful in the slightest. 

Discovery was not particulalrly optimistic. It was dark, and focused itself solely on a single person for most of it's run. Don't even get me started on the Short Treks. One was very offensive to me as a person with Aspergers, since the fella who was the brunt of the joke clearly was supposed to have it.

&amp;#x200B;

Picard is the show I will focus the most attention on. To start, the plot feels like it's been copied from Mass Effect. Actually, it HAS been copied from Mass Effect! Not only that, but it's filled with copies from other works of fiction. Again, not saying that inspiriation is not allowed. But pulling wholesale from other fictional events is plagarism. 

Not only that, but it's not family friendly at all. I have never seen R-rated star trek prior to Picard. Icheb got his eye torn out, in an overly gory way. And, here's the first bit that makes no sense: Seven mercy kills Icheb. Why? Doctor Mccoy has healed worse injuries than those that Icheb had! It was totally unnecessary. 

Add to this the constant cursing. Why? It's not needed, it's out of place, and it feels cheap. 

Here's another aspect of Picard that is un-Star Trek like. The Prime Directive has been abandoned. 

Remember this scene?

""The Federation doesn't have the right to decide what species lives or dies!"" 

""Yes, yes we absolutely do!""

That's the most un-Federation like thing an Admiral has ever said, and that's saying alot. 

I am not saying I want a perfect Federation. But this is an evil Federation. 

There are also alot of plotholes:

Why did the Romulans even need the Federation's help? They have an entire Navy! 

Why does Picard care so much about Data anyway? Beverly is the one he loves the most.

Seven on nine is now a violent psychopath. 

The Federation is now xenophobic, which it never was before. Sure, the Andorians may have been once, but not since the Federation was founded.

All-in-All, Picard feels like an alternate Mirror universe.

Please, understand: If this is what Star Trek will become in the future, then perhaps I should alter my expectations. But even so, Star Trek should inspire. One fan commented: Star Wars entertains, Star *Trek* inspires. This is not at all inspiring.

For those who say ""But the characters are points of light in the darkness!"" I say, ""The Federation is meant to be the torch of freedom in a galaxy of darkness. Like the United States, it is not perfect, but it always strives for perfection.""

9,"""The Transformed Man"" Is Canon + Listening Reaction",1589370109,"Warning: The following is long and pointless. Even by my standards.

You'll note I don't say ""first time"" listening reaction. This is because it isn't my first time hearing The Transformed Man, William Shatner's debut album.

As I've mentioned before, my first love is music. I'm genuinely obsessive about it with a musical collection so vast I don't like to indicateits size because people call BS and want photos and proof and so on. More than 20 years ago now I read an article about the worst albums ever made in the British music magazine Q which I subscribed to, and some of the items described were so bizarre my curiosity was piqued and I actually sought them out. One of them was The Transformed Man by William Shatner. And man was it an experience. I had literally never heard anything like it before. When Shatner returned to music after a 36 year hiatus with 2004's Has Been, my ears pricked up and he's kept up a steady trickle of releases since, even putting out two full LPs in 2018 at the age of 87. I'm therefore in the odd position of knowing Shatner for his musical career before I ever started watching the show this year.

Now I decided to cover The Transformed Man in my marathon because it came out in 1968, and I've just finished Season 2 and I believe Shatner did the album in the break between the two seasons so the chronology is right. Secondly, I'm about to watch Spock's Brain, which I have been warned is just about the worst thing TV ever did, so I thought to myself why not make a theme of it and do one of the worst albums ever made as well. Thirdly, The Transformed Man is canon.

Look at the cover.

 [https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/william\_shatner/the\_transformed\_man/](https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/william_shatner/the_transformed_man/) 

See that futuristic font. See that shot of Shatner awash in the golden glow of the light of futuristic starship captaincy. See how if you squint the title almost appears to be The Transported Man. Perhaps he just beamed in. But most critical of all, see how he is billed as Captain Kirk of Star Trek. But wait. What if this is a casting credit. William Shatner AS Captain Kirk of Star Trek. What if this actually Captain Kirk recording an album and therefore canon.

It makes a lot of sense. What you are about to hear is not music by any modern standard. In fact it sounds as alien to my ears as Kid A may have sounded to citizens of the 17th century. Perhaps this is where music has evolved to four hundred years since. Furthermore, consider the nature of the material. The recording partly consists of stirring, impassioned speeches, such as Kirk was known for. Perhaps we was exercising the oratory skills that made him such a great captain. And finally the ego. This album is just bursting with ego, with absolute, unbridled self-confidence and commitment of which only the man who flew a ship into the mouth of the doomsday machine would be capable of. Therefore I conclude that it is not the work of mundane, earthly William Shatner. No. This work of ethereal mind expanding genius could only come forth from the larger than life Captain Kirk. It is therefore canon, and you must all listen to it in its entirety as part of any Star Trek marathon.

So before I get started, is this actually the worst album ever made? No, but I can understand why it has that reputation. It isn't so much that it's bad, it's that it's BAFFLING. The album is extremely confusing in that I have no idea in what context I'm supposed to want to listen to the tambourine man from Mr Tambourine Man apparently being stalked and murdered by someone on a bad acid trip. I just have no idea who the audience for this is. Maybe there isn't one, maybe it's just a showcase of Shatner's vocal range and intensity. As the album takes the format of Shatner performing a piece of classical theatre paired with a dramatic reading of a modern pop lyric, maybe he was trying to cross pollinate the audiences of the two, reinventing classical theatre as pop and pop as classical theatre. And while that's a great idea, it doesn't quite work. We'll see why in detail below, but the TLDR is this: Shatner, apparently deliberately, frequently seems disconnected from the backing music. If you told me this was a guy practising speeches outside a studio where they were recording a film soundtrack and he wasn't aware that the mic was picking him up, I'd believe you. The two elements just don't integrate and it's discordant to the extreme that it is at points both disturbing and hilarious.

(If anyone's curious, if you want an idea of what I actually think could be the worst album ever made, listen to No Stockingz by Submarine Man. You must listen to it from front to back in its entirety. I warn you, you will be changed.)

Anyway, though I have heard this before, the last time must have been something like 15 years ago so it's not fresh in my mind. I remember Mr Tambourine Man and Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds, but the rest is something of a blur. But tonight I sit down in my den for 37 minutes to endure the entire thing so that my children will read these words I leave behind and shall never have to. Here we go.

1 King Henry The Fifth

Things kick off with what almost sounds like the infamous fight music from Season Two of TOS (what a shame that it isn't that music) as martial drums and horns lead into Shatner dramatically describing the background as Henry V attempts to rally his men to battle against a foe that outnumbers them. A task worthy of Kirk if ever there was one. I'm reading Shatner's autobiography Up Till Now at the moment, and I've just done reading about his background doing Shakespeare as a young man, how he was well received, how he worked with the famous Stratford festival, etc. Could have fooled me. Henry V sounds like he did a few lines of coke before coming out to encourage the men - hey maybe he passed the vial around, and that's really why the English recovered and overcame the French. Add in a notorious final cry of ""And Saint Geoooooooorge"" where Shatner appears to be falling into a ravine and it's not that impressive. It's bursting with energy, but lacks finesse. Still, not that bad so far, I'm feeling fine.

2 Elegy For The Brave

One of two originals (the other being the title track) written by producer Don Ralke for Shatner to perform. A nice backing track actually, very atmospheric, lovely bass, a nice lonesome harmonica as Shatner calms down and manages some nuance as he describes a lovely valley where the grass is soft and green and the sunlight sprinkles diamonds on a clear flowing stream. Possibly the best thing on the album, this puts Shatner's voice, which was capable of being quite beautiful and evocative in a context that works, with poetic words that vibrate with lyricism. Crucially, Shatner keeps himself under control on this track, with no point where he goes screaming off the rails, allowing an atmosphere to build and breathe. The album edges away from its meme status here as we glimpse the effective spoken word recording it might have been.

3 Theme From Cyrano

And then immediately pivots right back to ridiculousness. It was here I began to lose my sanity. The first two tracks were never going to get on my party playlist - the first was a bit pointless/silly but it didn't hurt me and the second was kind of nice, but I'm not in agony yet. This is I started to have misgivings about my decision to do this. People who have never made themselves sit silently through really awkward albums without skipping or breaks may not understand what an endurance test it can be. (Remind me to tell you kids about Metal Machine Music one day.) This track is where I started to go ""Do I really need to spend another half hour doing this? No one will care if I just stop. What am I trying to prove?"" Because this track reaches a sort of critical level of inanity that really ate at me. Near elevator music with the corniest harpsichord you've ever heard twitters away incessantly while Shatner reads a monologue from Cyrano which I can never focus on or make sense of because I'm too distracted by the lunacy of the situation. His reading is extremely fruity as it's so hard to tell whether he's being serious or sarcastic that all you will think is this, swirling round and around in your head until you go mad: WHAT IS HE DOING? IS HE BEING SERIOUS? And there is no answer, none. And as the music suddenly shifts into a bass heavy jazz shuffle with some delightful piano for no reason I can tell, the question of why this was being done, and why you are listening to it, will swirl around in your head in concentric circles creating its own black hole which draws in all of your being until you no longer know who you are.

4 Mr Tambourine Man

But then it turns out that Theme From Cyrano was just a warm up. NOW the album's going to get weird.

I can't imagine being the producer on this album. What were the discussions that Ralke and Shatner had.

Ralke: OK Bill, when you say ""in the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you"", it's really important you sort of growl it like you're full of brewing homicidal intent. You're following the tambourine man because you intend to kill him, remember that.

Shatner: Are you sure that's what Dylan meant?  
Ralke: Can you think of another interpretation? And for the other lines, remember to alternate between sounding completely indifferent, drunk and overcome with crippling paranoia and sadness.

Shatner: Got it Don. Oh can we have someone come in and bash a tambourine in an empty indoor tennis court completely off beat over the opening measures of the song.

Ralke: Way ahead of you Bill.

Remember the PTSD clarinet kid meme?  
""I was a kid. I loved Star Trek. Play clarinet for a session with the guy from Star Trek they said.

I can still hear the tambourine man's final cries.""

MR TAMBOURINE MAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN

5 Hamlet

This opens with ""Hamlet's endurance has reached the breaking point. His father has been murdered.""

I'm not surprised his endurance has reached the breaking point after that last track. Wait, his father has been murdered? Did he by chance ever play the tambourine?  
Shatner continues: ""His black mood of despair is deepened by his inability to act.""  
Ahahahaha, oh that's just too easy, the chuckle I had at that line, fish in a barrel.

And then Shatner begins an admittedly intriguing, whispery rendition of the famous Hamlet speech, with a very odd rhythym, racing through moments, pausing at others, while flute, strings and military drums become increasingly unhinged, and as with the open track, Shatner loses his cool and begins to bark. The track ends with an instrumental coda that is actually quite effective, rich with strange and mysterious emotions that I can't quite articulate. As with track 2, this feels kind of successful, in that Shatner is taking something familiar, the ""to be or not to be"" speech and making it strange with this music and this delivery, yet it doesn't become ridiculous, there's an integrity to it.

6 It Was A Very Good Year

""Oooooh"" I said when I saw this on the track list. Low-key regarded as one of Frank Sinatras masterworks, this haunting, ambiguous song with the most mysterious meldoy toys with the emotions so much - is it lighthearted? Joyous? Depressing? Fond? Regretful? It's got so much dark and light in it, and Sinatra's masterful delivery allows all these things to coexist without becoming messy. And oh the bass notes that kick in on the third verse. So Shatner had better be sure of himself before taking this on, and not, for instance, produce something less dignified than Homer Simpson's ""When I was 17, I drank some very good beer"" parody.

But actually this is pretty chill. It's one of the more forgettable tracks on the album - nice sax though. It doesn't touch me as much as tracks 2 or 5, Shatner's reading feels a bit flat and hum drum, but he doesn't disgrace himself either, playing it pretty straight. This is fine. As I flip the album over for side 2, I feel we're pulling out of the tailspin of tracks 3 and 4, and this isn't as bad as its reputation suggests.

7 Romeo And Juliet

The famous ""But soft what light through yonder window breaks"" speech from Romeo. I'm so disappointed that Shatner doesn't do a dual role as Juliet and act out both sides of a scene between them. Some very smooth strings back him with an almost-Greensleeves melody, and Shatner reads the part very lightly, a bit cheesily, but it's enjoyable enough. Again, this is fine.

8 How Insensitive

Now Shatner turns his hand to bossa nova. And you know this kind of works. Shatner's romantic, rogueish rendition of these lyrics over this actually quite tight backing is kind of sexy, and I don't mean that ironically. Here we get a glimpse of Shatner the lady's man, I can imagine these velvet tones and this intimate instrumental melting a few hearts. You could almost believe this was another original, it's put together just right for Shatner's voice.

9 Spleen

What am I to expect with this title? I actually have no idea what this is. It says ""translated by Frank Davenport"", Davenport being a lyricist who worked on this project, but I don't know what he's translating it from. This is actually kind of spooky, a real clash with the previous track, as Shatner dully intones imagery of rot against funereal bells and a foreboding oboe. ""When the low sky presses like a lid on my spirit, heavy with pain... like a bat fluttering blindly, dashing its head on the rotting ceiling... the long lines of grey rain becomes the bars of this huge prison..."" This isn't bad writing, it's quite dark and emo, almost like he's reading Poe. I could see Vincent Price doing this.

10 Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds

Ah but now we come to the ""hit"" of the album. Probably Shatner's most infamous song - aside perhaps from his notorious performance of Rocketman - this is what, if anything, people have heard from the album, which is what accounts for its reputation as being a meme machine, when really prior to this only tracks 3 and 4 had me doubting my life choices.

But I can see why, I can't defend this. This is unintentional comedy writ large. Now I know quite a few people have argued that Shatner is in on the joke but I just don't buy that. It's 1968, Shatner is still starring in Star Trek. ""I know, I'll make a really sarcastic and ironic recording of pop songs and make it indescribably awful to amuse myself when people are all confused and horrified by it. That will advance my career and get me the things I want."" No. That's a motivation that makes sense in 2020 when going viral and being a meme is a thing, but I don't believe for a second the people making this were thinking along those lines 52 years ago. No, I think this comes of sheer unchallenged confidence. Shatner is very brave, very bold, he had an idea, he ran with it, he didn't view it objectively, no one questioned him too much. That's the explanation that makes sense to me.

My only problem with this is it's too short. This should've been an epic, like six minute or so. It's less than three. The backing is a fairly faithful recreation of the Beatle original. The vocal is not. Now any Beatle scholar will be able to tell you this song is not about drugs. The memo did not reach Shatner whose unhinged erratic performance makes Mr Tambourine Man seem restrained. There's no rhyme or reason to his intonation, he sounds like he's on something, he slurs, he screams, he gets goofy, he goes high, he whispers, there's no rhyme or reason to it. And yes, it is quite hard to get through this without laughing. But it's not as funny as Rocket Man:  
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lul-Y8vSr0I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lul-Y8vSr0I&amp;t=114s)

11 The Transformed Man

With our final song, over a diverse, shifting but well assembled backing, Shatner describes a transformation from an oppressed unhappy city dweller to a man who lives in nature and becomes free and fulfilled. It's reminiscent of track 2 and quite nice, not a bad way to close things off. Well almost. At the end he starts overacting - if only it had finished half a minute earlier. When he goes ""I HAD TOUCHED THE FACE OF GOD"" and the fullblown strings and choir kick in, it's too much and threatens unintentional comedy again, a shame as this was almost good. Should have gone for a tasteful finale.

And so we come to the end. We've made it. It wasn't that bad. In fact only tracks 3, 4 and 10 were really worthy of the hyperbole this album gets. Like a lot of albums with awful reputations, it's the victim of a few bizarre tracks that are all anyone knows from it rather than the whole thing being terrible.  It's no Angelic To The Core by Corey Feldman.

Well if anyone's joined me on this strange journey, call a helpline. After that, see you soon for Spock's Brain, which I'm hoping is going to be much worse than Transformed Man to justify the hype.

And yes, this is a one-off, I'm not planning to cover any more Trek related albums. No, I am not going to do Two Sides Of Leonard Nimoy. But for the uninitiated, here you are:

In the Prime Timeline however we see Uhura struggle speaking Klingon to get past a Klingon border patrol during the events of Undiscovered Country (IIRC). That scene was mostly played for laughs, admittedly.

Of course, these two scenes clash and we can say that it must be due to the differences in the timeline. But then I was reminded of a small little detail: During the original series, Uhura is attacked by Nomad in the events of *The Changeling*. He erases her memories, forcing her to relearn everything with advanced medical techniques.

It could very well be that these techniques had some limits, and Uhura was not able to restore all he knowledge - less used abilities, like the ability to understand and speak Klingon, might have been something that got lost in the process, or at least severely reduced.

39,Borg Queen... Merely A Representation Of The Collective Or An Individual/Leader?,1589324330,"In star trek first contact when the Queen is introduced she tells data that she ""IS"" the collective and that his inquiry did not exist when he asked if she controlled the collective. That Implies that she is merely a physical representation of the Borg collective like an avatar...

Yet there's a couple times that idea is challanged and instead she seems to also be a seperate individual connected to the borg and indeed controls them

For example even in first contact the Borg started to approach data after he tried to escape and the queen raised her hand signaling them to stand down

On Voyager in the last episode the Borg identified Voyager when they entered the nebula ""vessel identified USS Voyager, we will pursue and assimilate"". Then the Queen literally overulled them and said ""no, they haven't compromised our security, let the vessel continue for now, I'll keep an eye on them""

She not only told the collective not to assimilate Voyager after they already planned to but by saying ""I'll keep an eye on them"" she's also refering to herself as an individual

So how can she just be the collective like she implied to data yet also show evidence to the contrary and that she is Infact a seperate being that controls them? What is she then exactly?",startrek,Newlycelebrities,False,/r/startrek/comments/gimiio/borg_queen_merely_a_representation_of_the/

DS9 - OK so we are going to write him as the perfect captain again. But wait, we did that with Picard....OK lets make him black.....maybe that wont be enough. Lets reduce his rank to commander until we can build his character up enough to make him captain.....OH, lets also give him a planet whose whole population worships him. The main thing is....we make him the perfect captain.

Voyager - OK so we are going to write him as the perfect captain.....wait OK OK we did that twice again already. Lets make him a her. shoot her across the galaxy so its basically her vs the galaxy and the borg and she beats them both. The main thing is....she is the perfect captain.

Enterprise - OK so we are going to write him as the perfect captain. OK so I know what you are going to say....we have done that 3 times now. But wait, hear me out. This is BEFORE all the other four, so this really actually is the first perfect captain after all, and he actually ends up being the poster boy and cardboard cutout for all future captains AND..oh....wait...where have all the viewers gone?

But I just watched The Communicator, in which a pre-warp species Army guy heard T'Pol calling for the Captain over the communicator, so that got me thinking I'm missing something.

56,Do the Borg now know about the Admonition,1589306574,"It's unclear wearer or not the Borg survived after Voyager, but lets assume they did as (as it will likely turn out they did survive if the writers of any post-Voyager show ever want to do a Borg story)

The Artifact disconnected from the collective after assimilating Ramdha, who had the message from the synthetic federation in her mind. And we know the admonition can be transferred through multiple organic hosts thanks to the 9th episode.

As the Borg are cybernetic, it wasn't the admonition that drove them insane it was the ""sheer force of Ramdha's despair"". So if the Admonition itself made it to the collective I think it's likely the Borg could understand it properly, which would have some drastic consequences.

We know from Species 8472 that the Borg will actively invade a more advanced species' territory simply because the Borg think they are ""more perfect"" then themselves. A universe-spanning federation of purely synthetic life forms would certainly fit the Borg's idea of perfection, so I don't think there is any real question that they would construct a beacon and ""invite"" the synths into the galaxy. Weather the Borg would be considered friend or foe isn't really relevant, the point is the Synthetics would have a foothold in our galaxy and would spread from there as the Admonition predicts.

It's possible some form of this is intended for a future Season of Picard, but if this doesn't happen I think that means either the Admonition didn't reach the collective as The Artifact collapsed too quickly or the Borg are truly gone.

Don’t get me wrong, I love Star Trek, but I’ve realized that I like other sci fi canons where teleportation doesn’t exist, and you have to physically travel between locations on a shuttle craft of some sort.

However, dad told me that while it's a great book, very funny and candid, it is the story of Shatner's life rather than a close discussion of Star Trek. I've only read the first two chapters and he hasn't got to Trek yet, instead describing his life as a poor, hungry actor in the 50s, but I'm quite enjoying it. I'll probably say something about it here once I finish it.

Noob Trek 55: Assignment Earth

Wait what, we've traveled back in time just casual like that? I can't remember all the details, it's gone a bit fuzzy in my head but I think we've time traveled twice previously on the show and both times it was treated like some wild uncontrollable thing, like it was new. I guess what could have happened is since Starfleet discovered it in those adventures, they've been experimenting with it and have now learnt how to do it, but it still feels like a bit of a leap.

Oh it's my birthday and I got a new audio setup (as you'll be reminded at the end of this post, I'm a huge audiophile, scary-level music obsessive) and I can already hear the difference. The bass notes in the theme music which I've barely noticed before are really popping now.

It's scuffed Robert Redford playing Gary Seven. Gary Seven, haha, what a name. I expect the other agents are named Timothy Two and Victoria Thirtyfive. Oh and they're trying to do Bond aren't they. A sharp dressed dapper gentleman with steely reserve strokes an elegant cat, and later we see some sort of multi-purpose gadget pen and all sorts of skulduggery with defusing wires and hidden computers and false credentials and missile launches, and so yes this does seem to be trying to appeal to the spy craze of the time, the Bond//Man From UNCLE/Mission Impossible etc. fad current when this was aired. There's even the sequence with the multiple doors opening over the safe in Seven's office that reeks of Get Smart. While mashing up the sci fi of trek with 60s spy thrillers is interesting, there's a couple of problems. First, we've just done this multiple times. Horror in Catspaw, war films in Patterns Of Force, gangster flicks in A Piece Of The Action, Roman epics in Bread And Circuses etc, it's getting old. And secondly, all of those did a better job (except Catspaw, that kinda sucked) because they picked a tone and generally stuck with it; for instance Piece Of The Action leaned into comedy, Patterns Of Force went more for seriousness. And thirdly, all those episodes gave lots of time and focus Kirk and the crew. In Assignment Earth however, our regular cast disappear for long stretches and are mostly irrelevant, which means the spy and sci-fi elements feel separated rather than blended.

The episode takes a dry businesslike attitude to the spy stuff, but punctuates it with comedic elements that don't work. Take Roberta for example. Ah, the comically idiotic secretary. It's 1968 alright. Pretty lame that Seven's security on his teleport is so lax that she defeats it by accident with her ass. She's supposed to be funny, but she isn't. The performance is amateurish and lacks timing and delivery, and the script isn't helping because it's light on actual joke. Asides such as the policemen being teleported to the Enterprise feel like filler and don't go anywhere, and didn't make me laugh, it seemed pretty by the numbers, uninspired. 

Which leads us to Lansing's performance as Seven which I'm still not sure about. Was Lansing being boring and wooden, or is Seven's inexpressive, unflappable exterior a creative choice, representing his upbringing/training and the nature of his mission? I'm leaning towards it being the latter because he certainly doesn't strike me as a bad actor, but still, this new character that we focus on so much being a bit of a stuffed shirt made it harder to be entertained.

What was it with stupid voices and useless swirly screens on TV computers of this time? Why did people think computer engineers would design computers to make a grating screech every time they communicated? Oh but here come Spock and Kirk to get Gary, cleverly deflecting suspicion by disguising themselves as KGB agents.

It's a tiny thing, but I notice an interracial couple clearly visible in the street scene, a white man and an Asian woman with a child. Maybe nobody cares because they're just extras, but I remember someone explaining to me that the reason The Alternative Factor was so weird was because it had a major subplot where Lazarus fell in love with a black woman jettisoned because it was too hot for TV at the time. So this is progress? Maybe?

Even though the idea of humans being abducted 6000 years go and being trained to be super awesome then returned to earth to act as super agents is intriguing, I have so many questions which the show just doesn't answer. Got any curiosity about these alien benefactors? Well shove it because you'll learn nothing about them. And these guys existing creates all sorts of internal problems. There's a group of specially trained humans in the 20th century operating with technology beyond that of the 23rd century? They've never noticed each other before? They never encounter them again? The concept seems a bit redundant for this show, it's like if you just transplanted the Star Trek crew and their tech to contemporary earth.

Are they ever going to explain this cat? No, no they're not. Is it a cat taken 6000 years ago and trained to be super smart and helpful? I - wait wait what the fuck, who's this mega babe suddenly on the couch? What was that for? That's all we see of her? What a waste. Is Isis a human, an alien, a cat that can project a hologram human image? And the big question: is Seven banging her? And if not, why not? The cat was well trained at least, it had some good acting directing on it. I'm just thinking that giving Gary a supercat without even attempting a clever explanation of why he has one, is another example of an odd note that stops this episode from cohering.

What this episode needs is more long lingering takes of Scotty glaring at rockets.

And how did the Enterprise get back to modern times? They just push a button now?

Well, this was a fairly decent episode of TV, but I'm not sure it was a good episode of Star Trek. While it wasn't as wacko as stuff like A Wolf In The Fold and The Omega Glory, this was low-key quite a weird episode in some of the structural and content choices made. It was an odd mix of straight-faced spy thriller and goofy comedy. The comedy elements didn't work very well, feeling tacked on and low on actual gags, while the spy thriller stuff was action-free and a bit dull.  Also, it felt like Kirk and Spock were appearing on Gary's show, the Star Trek crew felt mostly irrelevant. Still, it wasn't terrible and I was at least interested to see how it all played out and the concept of Gary and Isis was pretty cool.

NEXT TIME: The Transformed Man

That's right, I'm doing The Transformed Man. William Shatner's debut musical album, it is often considered one of the worst albums ever made so it's fitting that I cover it before I get on to Spock's Brain which I've repeatedly been told is the worst Trek episode ever made.

72,A rant about Kurtzman-era Trek.,1589282905,"OK, let me start this off by saying: None of the issues here are about politics, despite what Mr. Chabon thinks. I do not dislike Picard because of some far-right political leanings. I dislike it because I think it is not Star Trek. I do not give a wooden nickel, or even a  Zimbabwean penny,  about 'representation'. You can have every character gay, or trans, or Bi, or Lesbian, or trans-poly-queer, whatever. I would still watch it, if it were optimistic. 

&amp;#x200B;

Picard and Discovery are not optimistic. Sure, there might be some bright spots, but all-in-all they are dystopian and nihilistic. One fan even said Discovery 'makes you want to cut your wrists'. There's gory scenes, endless and unnecessary profanity. Even the most scarred Cardassian in that one DS9 episode wasn't very gory.  They put a transwoman in there for 'representation'. Do you know what I remember her for? Vomiting constantly. Might just be because I remember shocking visual experiences, but still. If this were the classic Trek writers, like Behr and Braga, they'd have made her an interesting character.  Show how in the 24th Century, trans people aren't even noticed, since they can predict with 100% accuracy if a kid will be trans or not, and their sex changed.

Don't even get me started on the special effects. One of them was literrally an edited stutter shock image(Not very well edited, mind you).

For those of you who say 'no one decides what Star Trek is and is not', let me give you this example: If a Superman story had him killing people, helping no one, and was dark and gritty, would you ever in a million years call it a good Superman story? No, no you would not. Unless it was an elseworlds tale. This is what Picard and Discovery is. A Star Trek elseworlds tale.

Incidentally, I’ve already read several times that the Vulcan crewed U.S.S Intrepid, which was mentioned in TOS: The Immunity Syndrome, directly refutes this. I own a fan essay from about 1983 that relates how the Federation put pressure on Vulcan over the fact that only one Vulcan had joined Starfleet (without siting sources).

[Somebody](http://blakessanctum.x10.mx/) created a [star trek mod](http://blakessanctum.x10.mx/Mods/Doom/) for gzdoom. he put a lot of work in this. gzdoom is a program which allows you to play the classic doom games with modifications, it also have a VR version available and this way i was able to use my htc vive pro with motion controls to play this mod. It was pretty fun but short (only demo is available) 

You can also play this and i'll leave all the details you need to know here:

So to start, the classic [Doom 1](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2280/Ultimate_Doom/) &amp; [Doom 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2300/DOOM_II/) games are required and also [gzdoom](https://zdoom.org/downloads) (or [gzdoomVR](https://github.com/hh79/gz3doom/releases/) if you have a vr system)

It's very easy to get it working. 1. copy the doom.wad &amp; doom2.wad file's from their installation folders to your gzdoom folder - 2. do the same with [the mod file](http://blakessanctum.x10.mx/Mods/Doom/) \- 3. slide the mod file on gzdoom.exe and you are good to go.

99,"What's the source for Colm Meaney and Alexander Siddig not getting along well, even hating each other?",1589222603,"According to Siddig, they were pub crawling twice a week for the entire seven years the show was on. There's this one story he tells where Meaney took him to an Irish pub prejudiced against English, but I always took it as a friendly jab. He did too since he even claimed their friendship off set was eventually being written into the show. 

Siddig did say that they were always fighting, but apparently more in a friendly or love-hate manner than some people interpret it as.

Quote from Siddig at [Trek Expo 2005](https://www.trektoday.com/news/070705_03.shtml):

&gt; Siddig laughed that his relationship with costar Colm Meaney (O'Brian) was more adversarial, as Meaney is an Irishman and considers Siddig an Englishman. He related a story in which Meaney took him out to get him drunk, only to have a bartender tell Siddig that he was not welcome. Siddig told Meaney that the man was racist, and ""Colm calmly replied, 'No, it:s because you're English.' He obviously enjoyed taking me to places where they would hate me. **Anyway, eventually our friendship and time spent in bars off the set ended up being written into the show and they put us in bars on the set.""** 

And [another one](http://sidcity.net/2010/07/11/sid-in-star-trek-magazine-genius-issue/):

&gt;DS9 also broke new ground by featuring so many interpersonal relationships. Bashir particularly bonded (if slightly antagonistically) with Miles O’Brien (Colm Meaney) and Garak (Andrew J. Robinson). “They classically exploited the British/Irish thing,” says Siddig, of the Bashir/O’Brien friendship. “We were going to be this pair who bickered at every opportunity.

&gt;“And it actually continued off-stage – Colm and I had furious fights about England and Ireland, and I had no idea politically about any of the stuff. I suspect now, looking back, that he didn’t have any idea either, but he spoke so passionately and vehemently about it that I believed every word he said! But he would take me to Irish bars, especially to ridicule me in front of the Irish clientele! I**t was good fun in the end. We loved to hate each other**. And we chose to go out with each other, even if it was to argue all night, so there must have been some bond there, beyond the ordinary. **I really enjoyed my time with Colm, and I really enjoyed the relationship that developed as a result of that.** In a shoe ostensibly about freedom, rebellion, terrorism, and religious oppression, this was a relationship that came out of dislike, but blossomed into a real love, which was really great.”

Colm Meaney, who is very opinionated on the (then) [apolitical Siddig](https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/film/colm-meaney-my-missus-doesn-t-like-los-angeles-she-s-french-1.4098226), probably among the sources for their friction:

&gt;Meaney remains politically engaged and is disappointed by younger actors’ lack of interest in bigger issues. 

&gt;“It’s Thatcher’s fault,” says Meaney. “So much of Britain was destroyed in the ’80s. When we started on Deep Space Nine, Alexander Siddig, a British actor, came over and joined the cast and I asked him about Equity meetings. Because when I was in London we used to go to Equity meetings for the ferocious battles. On one side, there was Vanessa [Redgrave] and the WRP [Workers Revolutionary Party] faction and then the right-wing [faction] led by the appropriately named Marius Goring and Olivier. They were amazing political debates but they were really entertaining. So I couldn’t believe it when Sid said: ‘I don’t know; I’m not a member of Equity.’

And here, explicitly stating that they [got along well](https://youtu.be/gwSg89LniZ4?t=208), although the name is hard to understand.

Apparently today Meaney is still very close to Avery Brooks, and Siddig with Andrew Robinson and Nana Visitor. Although they live closer to each other in Europe it doesn't appear they're still that close. 

However, claiming that was not my point here. I'm rather wondering why people apparently think they hated their guts. To me it's very clear they were two different people from different backgrounds (English vs. Irish; international, upper class vs. working class; very opinionated politically vs. apolitical) who nevertheless hit it off behind the scenes and enjoyed their fights and time spent together. A bit like Bashir and O'Brien...

0,TNG Watch Order/Character Progression,1589221457,"Hi All.

I am a big fan of Trek, have been since TNG first came out and have watched all the series' several times. But I find TNG a bit dated to watch now, particularly the lack of a coherent subplot/ monster of the week format.

About 10 or 15 years ago I came across a watch order for TNG that basically fixed all that because instead of watching it in air order, you watched it in character arc order. You know how there were a lot of episodes which predominantly focussed on one character - so you'd watch all the Picard episodes, then all the Wesley episodes, then all the Riker episodes, then all the Worf episodes, then all the Borg episodes etc. This order of viewing all the episodes really offset the monster of the week format for me because you got to focus on character development instead. I am not sure if that makes sense, but instead of watching all 140-odd episodes, you'd just watch the 10 or 15 episodes which were predominantly about one of the main characters. 

I really enjoyed it again watching it that way, because instead of just skipping all the filler episodes, they would retain have a degree of relevance to the character's story-arc progression.  However, I cannot find this viewing order list, when I search I just find the order for watching all of Trek which is not what I am looking for. 

I hoped someone on here might have a clue what I was talking about and could send me in the right direction to find the list.

5,DS9 - Sacrifice of Angels - Dominion Withdrawal Discussion,1589214600,"Fair warning: this’ll be more than a little armchair-general-y.

So I recently rewatched the Dominion War arc [Call to Arms - Sacrifice of Angels] from DS9, and this occurred to me after watching the end. 

Why did the Dominion not destroy the station when they left? (Yes I know the out-of-universe reason; I address that below) They have no strategic reason not too. Especially since, as far as they can tell, they just lost a fleet of thousands of ships mysteriously in the wormhole, and ~200 Federation ships are on their way, and they [The Dominion] need to even the score for that battle somehow.

During Operation Return, when it is clear, from the Dominion perspective that the battle is lost and they prepare to leave, why did they not initiate the self destruct sequence on their way out? From the Dominion perspective, it is a *terrible* strategic decision to allow their enemy access to a heavily armed position near a critical choke point (the wormhole). Also, while you could ask the same of the Federation when they were forced out before, the answer for them is that it is not within their moral standards to do something like that, which would kill everyone on board. Also Sisko’s program royally screws up the computers on his way out, so you could say that is better than nothing. The Dominion does not share this moral position though; in the same episode, Weyoun completely casually talks about wiping out Earth’s entire population, and the Dominion has previously shown that they do not care  about things like collateral damage, civilian casualties, etc., and they send their ships on Kamikaze runs, and yet when they are defeated, they just leave, when they have the capability to deny their enemy access to a critical position, or at least it is not indicated that they do not have the ability to do so.

Can anyone think of any in-universe reason why the Dominion wouldn’t simply evac the founder and maybe Weyoun and upper Cardassian leadership, and set the station to explode (such as via self-destruct sequence) after they leave? Also, the destruction of the station, and associated deaths of everyone on board would serve as a nice reminder of just how far they are willing to go to accomplish their goals, as they previously demonstrated in “The Jem’ Hadar”.

Now, I understand the out-of-universe reason why. It’s because then we wouldn’t have a show past that point. Although I disagree with that, and am of the opinion that you could continue the show afterwards, and even have it be very good, but it would look radically different, but that is a different discussion.

You have complete tactical surprise in every encounter. In DS9 we constantly see entire fleets coming out of nowhere, surprising everyone every time.  


There is no way the Federation (or anyone else, Dominion included since it's not efficient enough to actually spot cloaked ships: the Klingons ambush them constantly) could win a real war against a faction with pervasive cloaking tech.

21,“Take Me Out to the Holosuite” DS9 S7E4,1589187604,"Even though the Starfleet team lost, as they should let’s be honest, they shouldn’t have even stood a chance.

Especially if the only two “veterans” are the Siskos and everyone was terrible. 

I get that the entire point was that Sisko made a totally emotional irrational decision, which the Vulcan captain has apparently written many papers basing human emotion on Sisko so his point is well validated, so it was never about winning and the fact they lost only shows to prove how irrational he was, the simple fact that his team was able to score any point or get anyone out is a miracle. Even Bashir totally sucked and he was genetically altered with improved hand eye coordination. It’s not everything but that should at least mean he’s able to hit a ball. 

Also is it possible with the Ferengi’s heightened sense of hearing that they could possibly be trained to hear an incoming ball with their eyes closed and hit it?

-There is an alien war criminal (a general?) who acts as the main villain. Towards the end he’s put on trial in a dilapidated courthouse for war crimes but he’s shot in the head. 

-The main character crawls out of a torpedo silo. I remember he sucks in his breath instead of out, something about space rules.

52,So the Talosians have really big heads and clearly intelligent but how smart are they?,1589145502,"When I was reviewing ""The Cage,"" an episode that I enjoy and gave a 3 out of 5, I found myself thinking about Star Trek's oldest antagonists.  They have really big heads, they are exceptionally powerful illusion makers which must come with some intelligence, and if you find big heads with vain popping out attractive they can also be very sexy.

But how smart are they?  Because when it comes to long-term planning I think they are fairly dumb.  I say this mostly because of Vina.  We learn in the course of the episode that their intention is to mate her and Pike so they can create a new race of humans. At first we think that the breeding is to keep the Talosians entertained with zoo animals.  However as the episode goes on we learn that they need them to create a new race to continue on their lost culture.  When asked why they couldn't just seek out volunteers the Talosians said that anyone who came would be corrupted by their power of illusion just as they were when they allowed their civilization to turn to dust.    

This raises a number of interesting questions:

1) What mechanism do they think they have that would prevent the same fate for the Pike/Vina offspring? It seems to me if native Talosians can't resist the power of illusion and humans can't either, what gives the humans-raised-on-Talos IV this unique ability?  What type of long term planing is this?      

2) They think they make an entire colony with just two people.  With all their access to our equipment they didn't both to look into genetics at all?  This is really dumb of them.  Just look up King Charles II of Spain and his was the result of uncles marrying nieces three generations in a row.  This is a set up for failure. Maybe their powers of illusion will hide their failure from them.

3) So when the truth of Vina is revealed it makes the above problem far worse.  We get to see the state of the basket they to hold all their eggs and it is full of holes.  ""Everything works"" I am not sure I trust that statement when we see her try to walk and she can't move straight.  How many healthy babies were they thinking she could produce?  I would be surprised if she could carry any to term.

All Good Things returns to this concept by showing in a possible future they eventually got married. 

There are a lot of problems with the TNG films, but for me one way to have something of impact to happen would have been Picard and Crusher being trapped on the Enterprise together, rather than him and Lily. Ultimately Lily is a one-off character who is never seen again, while Crusher being there could have added a natural conclusion to their romantic arc (especially given that she has barely any screentime in that film).

Back when Star Trek Magazine was a thing (good times!) and they did a feature on the design of the Klingon Bird of Prey, I remember reading about how the villains in ST3 were originally meant to be Romulans. I believe either Leonard Nimoy or Harve Bennett decided to change them to be Klingon because they were more theatrical as enemies, but that an early script called for Kruge to steal the Bird of Prey from the Romulans. 

This part of the script was left out, and ever since, the Bird of Prey has been a Klingon ship! Of course, when you look at the design and compare it to the TOS BOP with its wing layout and orange bird painting on the underside, it's easy to image the Klingon BOP as a Romulan design -- especially when you think of how the TNG Warbird is the now-classic Romulan green. 

If you are not familiar with the Winged Defender in the second image, it isn't canon, but IIRC was part of the FASA Star Trek board game that was made in the early 80s. It, along with the Romulan Whitewind and Bright One from the same game, really clearly show what the rest of the Romulan fleet might have looked like if it was all related to the BOP from ST3. So that was some good inspiration too.",startrek,alphavill3,False,/r/startrek/comments/gh3ads/romulan_tmpera_warbird_concept/

80,Would a smaller Picard story have worked better?,1589101347,"Just wondering...

I'm not talking about liking or not liking particular characters - just the overall story.

What if Oh wasn't the head of Starfleet Security - what if she was a historian and had been a friend of Picard since he retired. She came across an old legend on a Vulcan site which she interpreted to mean AI could cause the end of everything and disappeared - presumed dead.

A few years later Picard, Laris and Zhaban are all historians - working together on a Romulan site and come across details of the same legend.

Shortly after Picard gets news that B4 has been killed. Maddox is able to discover it was Oh and reaches out to Picard for help. He and B4 (who had started to develop since Nemesis) were working on and nearly finished a procedure which would have allowed them to re-activate Lal.

Leave out the Mars attack - in fact leave out the destruction of Romulus altogether - leave it in the JJ movie universe. Leave out the Borg, leave out the new crew, leave out the android colony and definitely leave out the tentacles through the portal.

96,Why Star Trek: Picard fails to uphold the pillars that make Star Trek timeless and excellent. (Spoilers),1589077035,"With the coming of ST:P, I ended up going down a rabbit hole of rewatching TOS, TNG, finally giving DS9 another chance, and Voyager. I'd always considered Ds9 ""not for me"" because when I had seen it in pieces when I was younger, I didn't enjoy it / didn't like most of the cast. Now having finished Picard, and also finally finishing Ds9 for the first time, it's made me realize that TNG/DS9/VOY was a golden age of Trek that we will likely never see again, and that the people making Star Trek now have lost sight of what made Star Trek great. I would say this applies to Discover as well, though I think Discovery had amazing potential that was squandered in politics and losing insanely talented showrunners (Meyer, Fuhler) to it. I'm going to focus on Picard though, because I believe that Picard had everything it needed to be absolutely incredible, but couldn't see the trees for the forest.

Going all the way back to TOS and all the way through ENT, what has always made Star Trek so incredible is that at it's core, the episodic format allowed it to focus on human stories. Just about anyone can dive into Star trek, and given the correct episodes, can find something they empathize and relate with. The entirety of TOS was built on this principle, easily seen in the main trio. The crux of TOS was Kirk, Spock and McCoy trying to find balance, to find the common ground between Spock's cold logic and McCoy's fiery emotions so that they can find the best possible resolution for the episode's problems. When you look at what people consider the ""best"" of Trek, it's even more obvious. Wrath of Khan and Undiscovered Country are very human stories, revenge and prejudice. Inner light is about family and catastrophe, the Visitor is about loss and living life. There's so many examples! TNG is about the daily lives of the crew as try to navigate first contact situations, or diplomatic issues. My personal favorite episode is Lower decks, about a group of friends trying to build their careers among people who seem larger than life and unapproachable, ending in a somber note as they remember what they lose for their choices.

Picard was so focused on the huge, galaxy ending threat, that we barely get to know the people we're following. Even Ds9 which is about a massive scale war, is told through the stories involved in the war, not the war itself. We actually see very few large scale battles, but what we do see is the disaster that follows. We see the crew dealing with casualty reports (Which anyone who lived through 9/11 can empathize and understand), we see Nog lose his leg and try to move on, we see the families that grow even faced with impending danger. It's all told entirely through the lens of our characters and how they're managing, what they're feeling, what they will do. Picard essentially drags us through constant action pieces are we fly through this conflict. 

And this is where I think Picard had the chance to be good, but failed. It has genuine moments mixed into it, but they are few and far between. Show me more of Raffi trying to reconnect with her family, show me Elnor struggling to adapt to modern life, show me Rios handling his PTSD, show me more of Seven and her criminal ex and her struggle to regain her humanity. We see some really egregious things too, like Seven being paired off in the last 5 seconds of the finale! Apparently the producers looked at Seven and Chakotay and said hold my beer. 

And this draws me to what I truly think is the biggest crime of Picard, and that's ignoring the lush, vibrant universe that it's set in. You can't name a show Picard, come back after all these years with a million questions from people about how the universe has changed, how their favorites have moved on, and ignore it all. You know what I care more about than synths? The entire cast of TNG, Voyager, DS9, etc. What happened when Sisko returned? How did Voyager handle coming home? Why did Chakotay and Seven split? How did Icheb handle joining starfleet? How did Seven join the Rangers? What happened to the Doctor and how did his program affect all other holograms? There are an enormous amount of incredible human stories to explore in the universe that would have excited all the fans, while still being relatable to new viewers. 

Even when you look at the plot we did get, it does everything it can to avoid the human side and the philosophical questions that come with it. We never get to explore that essentially, the zhat vash were essentially right! Despite that their methods were heinous, they were right all along. Why does this have no impact? We spend all season with the liberated borg, but they do nothing with the plot. We lose Hugh for cheap emotional hits, when we could have had many stories of his struggle to help his people recover and integrate. Why were Zhaban and Laris only introduced in the comics? Their portrayal was excellent, they could have easily carried their own story on the screen. 

The show introduced plenty of interesting characters, and had a whole catalogue of characters to revisit. They could have done so much, but instead we get a rushed adventure to stop a faceless threat, and it feels so empty. Even the big standoff in the finale was boneless, because instead of using a lush list of choices of ships, we get a bunch of copy pasted ships. Where's the vesta class? The titan class? Hell, even the odyssey? It was a moment where with very little change, they could have had -so- much impact. Give me Riker on the bridge of the Galalxy-X, let me revel in having been a fan.

Even despite all this, I do believe there's hope. They managed to contain the plot to the first season, they can still pivot to a more character driven story, and I really do hope it comes. The connectedness of TNG/DS9/VOY felt organic and amazing, it felt like a real, breathing universe that was moving even when we weren't watching. It was an incredible moment in Trek that reminds me of why the MCU is so incredible and successful. They have a universe, it's time they start using it. 

A bit too much rambling, but hopefully I got my point across. I think we all love Star trek and want it to succeed, and I think this is a rare moment of time that can make or break Trek for the foreseeable future and I desperately want to see it move in a better direction.",startrek,VGHSDreamy,False,/r/startrek/comments/ggsxt9/why_star_trek_picard_fails_to_uphold_the_pillars/
97,State of Nu-Trek in 2020,1589075658,"As I finished Picard last night, a tad late - I know, I realised that was tick two for the counter of nu-trek shows I was really just mild on. Discovery making up the first. 

To put things in perspective I’m not a boomer whose furious over the new SJW themes in nu-trek, I’m a 21 year old whose enjoyed *every* series, a feat not a lot of trekkies can claim.

But it’s obvious something is wrong when DISC and PIC both miss the mark. And this is particularly abrasive when shows like The Orville are better Star Trek than either of these series. In my opinion, The Orville punches at the same level as the old-school big boys, VOY, TNG, and TOS.

For those who are unaware, a sci-fi/comedy love-letter to Star Trek adopted the old episode formulas and made it work!! But not only this, it did so with a fresh feeling, ethical and moral dilemmas reminiscent of TNG and VOY, and next-level character relationships (Doctor and the Robot/ Bortus and Clyden).

If anyone had doubts on the series from the first few episodes, rest assured, the heavy hitting stuff will take the focal point from the gags and farce. Seth wrote those first few episodes to convince Fox he was making a parody of Star-Trek, little did they know he was writing a love letter.

My main problem with DISC can be explained well by u/SockRuse who said DISC “stylizes Burnham into some world saving super hero character. Oh look, the future of the entire galaxy is at stake and Burnham is the only person who can save everyone ... AGAIN. This sort of singular super hero story just doesn't fight Star Trek in the slightest, it's always been a tale of the success of the many and of the success of cooperation.” ... BOOM!

PIC seems marginally better as it doesn’t pretend to be a starship episodic, but more of a mystery story. I do have problems with the writing however, I’m sure many of you experienced head-shaking and ‘whyyy’ moments.

Ultimately, I respect both DISC and PIC for keeping this beautiful franchise alive, and there are moments in both where I enjoyed them.
