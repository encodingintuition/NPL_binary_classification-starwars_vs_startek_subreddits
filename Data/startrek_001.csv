The actor, Suzie Plakson, portrayed the perfect balance of dismissive arrogance (when it came to *Klingon* traditions) and incisive diplomacy (when it came to Klingon *traditions*). You saw the former in her dealings with Worf and his discommendation, and the latter when she helped to bring the sleeper ship *T'Ong* into the 24th century and, more importantly, advise Picard in his role as Arbiter of Succession.

VOY - The Cloud, Persistence of vision

ENT - Fight or flight, Silent enemy

DS9 - The Nagus, The house of Quark

48,Getting my partner hooked,1601274651,"Hi all,
I'm a lifelong sci-fi series fan, and while I don't primarily count myself as a ""crazy Trekkie"", ST does occupy a special place in my heart. My partner likes good stuff too, but somehow managed to get this far in life without seeing all the same shows as I did. So for me it's a constant topic of ""ooo I wish you've seen that BSG episode I'm referencing"", or ""that reminds me of the time G'Kar said that..."" Still, life is short and there is so many amazing shows to rewatch and show her the wonder of. I should also add, she is not a binge watcher, so ""sit down and watch 15 episodes in a row"" is not a plan I should suggest. But spending a few evenings a week watching something together does create excitement, watching Expanse or His Dark Materials together each week has been great... Anyhoo, I digress.... 

She sat down next to me to watch Picard, so we've been through all the ""what is a Borg"" , ""what is a romulan"", ""who is Riker"", etc. And then when Lower Decks came on and I showed the first episode to her, she positively loved it. The fact that the show is super hilarious helped too. But of course the hundred references per minute go over her head, and I spend the after episode talk quickly summing up all the cool things to know.

After this week's amazing episode I've been given the permission to compile a list of 30 episodes to give her the shakedown of ""What's Star Trek is really about"". This got me suuuper exciting, as I can give her the examples of why I love this show, without having to commit either one of us to watching the daunting number of several hundred episodes.
And I'm hoping when DIS S3 comes back I can get her hooked into jumping straight in (given it's a bit of a soft reboot), or quickly rewatch S1 and 2 (which are luckily much shorter than old school trek seasons).

So I spent half the night composing this list, and I'd love to get your input on it.

**TOS**
Balance of Terror
Menagerie (2 eps)
City on the Edge of Forever
Mirror mirror
Trouble with Tribbles

**TNG**
Q Who
Measure of a Man
Yesterday's Enterprise
Best of Both World's (2 eps)
Darmok
Unification (2 eps)
All Good Things (2 eps)

**DS9**
Duet
Far Beyond the Stars
The Visitor
Trials and Tribbleations
Purgatory's Shadow / By Inferno's light (2 eps)
In the Pale Moonlight
Siege of AR558

**VOY**
Scorpion (2 eps)
Tinker Tailor Doctor Spy

**ENT**
United / Aenear / Babel One (3 eps)

Concerns I have:
- DS9 has 8 episodes, and I spent 2 of them on ""unusual"" ones
- Siege of Ar558 spoils Jadzia's death (by the virtue of Ezri's presence) and is a sort of small sample in the middle of the war
- so I was thinking of dropping Siege and Far Beyond the Stars to add Way of the Warrior (2 eps) instead, but Fbts is so good,it bothers me. Maybe drop the Visitor instead??
- I really love S3 and S4 of Enterprise, but they are watched great as a sequence. I picked the Aenear three partner because it has Shran, Romulans, Vulcans, action, founding the Federation, etc. But I want the Soong three parter, the Kirshara three parter, and the Klingon forehead two parter too... Very hard to pick.
- how do I not have a great O'Brien episode anywhere? He is the most important man in all of Starfleet history. Canonically.

Then, upon seeing my suffering, she gave me a 5 episode runner up list. Which caused me more pain because the episodes I wish I have added are
- Chain of Command (2 eps)
- Birthright (2 eps)
- another ENT 3 parter
- emissary (2 eps)
- year of hell (2 eps)
- I Borg
- Tapestry
- Tholian Web

November 19, 1994... I went to my first Trek movie in the theater with Dad.  It was one of the only times I can remember him wanting to go to the theater on a movie's opening weekend.  We'd gone to so many movies in my youth, but most of them were more for me than anything else.  This was one of a few that was actually for *us* to enjoy together.  I remember the thrill of watching so many of my favorite characters there on the screen, sharing a big tub of buttery popcorn with Dad.  After the movie, the ushers were handing out free posters to anyone who wanted one.  Dad snagged one of the last ones for me.

&amp;#x200B;

A few years ago, I lost my dad to cancer.  Trek remained across those years as one of our favorite things to do together.  Earlier this year, my mom sold my childhood home.  I went in to get what I wanted from it.  I found out I couldn't remove the poster without destroying it.  The poster, the physical object of a joyous memory, is gone.  [But I took a picture of it with my phone to keep](https://imgur.com/561b4175-f1b3-45ed-a7f9-7b02a1e40fe4).  The memory of that day is strong; I don't have to have the physical object, but looking at that picture still makes me feel thirteen again.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm nearly forty now, and have two kids of my own.  One has little interest in science-fiction; the other is still in diapers.

What SF Debris describes as ""a set of guns strapped to an engine."" You want ships that don't waste resources deploying your phasers and photon torpedos 

I don't see the purpose the Enterprise serves in Yesterdays Enterprise except for troops transport. But space wars aren't won with troops they're won with ships.

When I try to imagine how this is possible, I think back to that 9 year old kid in the first season who was taking Calculus, and he was presented as being an ordinary kid, not a genius.

He actually stuck out more in contrast with the hyper emotional, pew-pew pacing of Discovery as someone who’s optimistic, open-minded, and level headed. A great example that classic Trek can be done and done well in the modern era. It was fantastic.

While we’ve not really seen much of Number 1, she comes across as a better written and more relatable female character than was it seems they were going for for Burnham.

I enjoy Spock and think he was performed well, although Leonard Nimoy and Zachary Quinto also performed fantastically, even if the writing for the latter was terrible.

The Enterprise redesign is actually my favourite version of the original ship. It’s clearly the Enterprise, but how you’d imagine it would be if they made it today.

Lastly, the TOS uniform redesign is my favourite version. It looks like an actual uniform while keeping the different department colours. It doesn’t look like a sweater with a badge sewn on like in TOS or a cheap Halloween costume like in the Kelvin movies. I think the Kelvin uniforms come off as cheap to me because of the Starfleet logo patterns, which they fix in Beyond for an infinitely better design.

If they write Pike and the crew of the Enterprise the way they did in DISCO S2, I think Strange New Worlds could be genuinely fantastic.",startrek,f0rever-n1h1l1st,False,/r/startrek/comments/j0m9yh/im_genuinely_cautiously_optimistic_for_strange/

(ENT) Archer: Always seemed like he knew how to have a good time. Especially with T'Pol riding him about protocol. 

(PIC) Picard: I know Jean-Luc knows how to drink and he'd have a lifetime of awesome stories to tell. If we could get him to launch into a speech, the better. 

(TOS) U'Hura: I didnt want it to be all dudes, and first i thought about Troi because she would probably be hilarious drunk. But since I only saw TOS once let me pick someone whom I dont know all that well and could enjoy getting to know.

50,More DS9 trivia!,1601145059,"But this one actually has relevance to the story!

The season 4 finale, ""Broken Link"" opens with Garak calling Odo into his store. A woman comes out dressed in a Garak original, and asks how it looks. Garak replies, ""A thing of beauty is a joy for ever."" This is the first and oft-quoted line of the widely celebrated Keats poem ""Endymion."" Garak then introduces Odo to her, Chalan Aroya, a new business owner on the promenade who is interested in Odo romantically. 

The episode continues; there is something wrong with Odo and he can't maintain a shape. He is also in a lot of pain. The DS9 crew takes him into the Gamma Quadrant and meet up with the Founders to find help for him. The Founders will help him, but he must be judged by the Great Link for his earlier violence against another changeling. Odo accepts their judgement, and is turned into a human.

Aroya appears again at the end of the episode and reminds Odo, who despite his curiosity and interest in solids is none too pleased about actually being one, that there are ""advantages to being humanoid."" bow chicka bow bow

So, okay, whatever, but why did I bring up that Keats line? I mean who cares right? Leaving aside the fact that a Cardassian talking to a Bajoran for the sake of a Changeling isn't likely to drop some Yeats, it is actually a very interesting choice by the writers who are doing it for the sake of us, the viewers.

""Endymion"" is a love poem based on a Greek myth about a human, Endymion, who falls in love with the goddess Diana (or rather the idea of the goddess, or the idea of un-earthly love in general, it can be hard to tell with Greek stories what they really mean by ""love""). It is a very long poem, and Endymion goes through many travels and trials in his search for Diana, in search of the joy that he has only so far glimpsed. He eventually finds it in a mortal woman:

""In the end when [Endymion] feels the love for the mortal maiden, he realizes she is really Diana, his immortal desire in mortal disguises. He apprehends the dangers of denying his own human nature and learns that ***he can achieve the abstract ideal only if he accepts the concrete human experience.*** This is the central idea the Keats wants to deliver through this poem.""

Odo is not particularly happy to be a solid, despite his love for Kira and his general curiosity about the solid experience. But he does put a lot of stock in abstract ideals, like his love of Justice and, in a way, his love for Kira that he thinks is impossible because of their differences. In this case, Kira is the mortal and Odo is the god that becomes humanoid, but the point still stands that Odo must accept *solid, concrete humanoidism* in order to actually be able to *realize abstract concepts* like love and be true to his concept of Justice and his acceptance of the other Changelings judgement. 

Now you'll have to excuse me; I'd love to get even more into the details on this, but I'm supposed to be writing a completely different essay about a completely different poem without including any Star Trek references whatsoever…

Like Moriarty. I imagined that Data often visited him, to get another perspective of being an artificial person in an organic galaxy. Maybe eventually letting him run the holodecks, to make programs interesting, as long as he keeps the safeties on. But, no, they decided that he had been inactive for all those years.

It’s thrilling, full of character and complexity plus Ricardo Monteban’s performance made Khan one of cinema’s most iconic villains. 

However the climax of the movie really irks me for one reason; Khan is beaten because he forgets that space combat is 3d....

What. The. Fuck?! 

I know this is a nitpick but it’s really mindboggling to me, Khan wasn’t born in the 19th century, aircraft and submarine warfare were well established in his lifetime! At the worst he would be aware of the theory behind both and could apply that knowledge to space combat.

To make it more infuriating the line was unnecessary, Khan was already shown to be blinded by his need for revenge, that he was giving chase into the nebula. We’d seen time and again that he was making mistakes, letting his emotions get the better of him.

TLDR; Khan should be aware of fighting in a 3d space because planes and subs fucking exist.",startrek,Coma-Doof-Warrior,False,/r/startrek/comments/j03rzf/theres_one_aspect_of_wrath_of_khan_that_really/

""I shall welcome death when it comes.""

After I watched it for the first time, I remember I had a small freakout moment that night when I was lying awake on my bed. Thinking about how long it took for that dude to die, permanently stuck in a Vegas casino hotel... sitting on a bed that has the smell of cigarettes permanently embedded into the bedsheets; the obvious fakeness of the whole situation, for however long it took him to die, probably of self-imposed starvation. 

The general vibe of the episode was supposed to be uplifting overall once they figure out what the aliens wanted, but this TNG episode triggered a deep-seeded fear in me about being trapped, isolated somewhere, like being inside a coffin while I'm still alive. The fact that it's a slightly old-timey looking hotel with blank walls, stale air, and insane characters continuously re-enacting the plots to a ""second-rate novel"" for hundreds of years.

74,Star Trek Botnik Scripts,1601093682,"So  I got permission from at least a mod... and apparently the first source I used reddit hated it so much that it won't let them approve it... so this is me trying again, this is likely a small bit  insanity and curiosity for me, if its not for you then that is great!

So  Botnik is a predictive text artificial intelligence, it takes in  content in the form of text files and forms a 'key board' and from that  keyboard it is able to make predictions ranked 1 to whatever on what  comes next as a word. Botnik doesn't do very well with punctuation or  grammar, even the best artificial intelligence right now doesn't to be  very candid, so the co-writing effort in making a script is mostly  trying to help Botnik to turn babbling into something a bit more  coherent (I think). Botnik tends to tell the same story (maybe in a  different way even if its done again from a fresh start) so its not  really 'choose your own adventure' or 'mad lib'.

Now...  the first script is actually posted on the botnik website, their  publishing process doesn't make any sense to me so I have been using an  alternate source (which maybe will cause issues with this post being  approved) but this first one was not cowritten by me and is from **Star Trek - The Next Generation** [https://botnik.org/content/tng.html](https://botnik.org/content/tng.html)

Its roughly speaking about random interactions on the Enterprise D including a visit from Q.

This  next one was co-written by me and since botnik took an angry nap when I  tried to feed it ALL of the deep space nine scripts I decided to just  feed it the first season, this is the result **Deep Space Nine Season 1 -  starfleet officers don't often find mates who want to raise families on a starship** [https://www.deviantart.com/thunderswimmer/art/ST-DS9-Fanfic-Botnik-Airdate-2-856245254](https://www.deviantart.com/thunderswimmer/art/ST-DS9-Fanfic-Botnik-Airdate-2-856245254)

Its roughly about Sisko trying to find the truth about the Wormhole.

The next one again co-written by me is **Deep Space Nine - Season 2 -** **The federation consulate** [https://www.deviantart.com/thunderswimmer/art/ST-DS9-Fanfic-Botnik-The-federation-consulate-856245490](https://www.deviantart.com/thunderswimmer/art/ST-DS9-Fanfic-Botnik-The-federation-consulate-856245490)

Its  roughly about Sisko trying to save someone from the ""Federation Popular  Project"", which isn't mentioned anywhere but I really love the idea,  sort of a ""Voice of America""[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice\_of\_America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_of_America) or ""Cool Japan"" (a project by the government of Japan to market Japan as cool, basically) [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool\_Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_Japan)

This  one is less funny and actually a pretty coherent script (at least for  botnik), I took the first few Star Trek movie scripts and this came out,  **star trek: the test three**  [https://www.deviantart.com/thunderswimmer/art/ST-TOS-Movies-Fanfic-Botnik-The-test-three-856245687](https://www.deviantart.com/thunderswimmer/art/ST-TOS-Movies-Fanfic-Botnik-The-test-three-856245687)

Its  roughly about the Enterprise is sent to investigate what has happen to  the Federation project ""Test Three"", the crew has disappeared, its a  little bit of a mystery and I was really pleasantly surprised what it  turned out to be. Its an extremely humanitarian story.     &gt;!Basically Botnik tells a story, if I am reading this right, of the  Federation reaching out to save refugees in another dimension radically  different from our own escaping Jabba.!&lt;

So there we go... thats all the Botnik scrips I am aware of.

Like  I mentioned its a strange interest and hobby of mine... to do this with  botnik. If you liked it thats great. If not... ha... I can kinda  understand why botnik and this sort of work is still in its infancy.

80,"Just finished all series, what a voyage it was!",1601082858,"I started watching the series in December 2018 and just finished Enterprise around half an hour ago. Except the last episode of The Lower Decks and animated series, now I can say I watched it all.

During the voyage, I lost a job while Kirk and Spock was exploring the final frontier. Found a new job after meeting Captain Picard. Lost an uncle and an aunt somewhere in Enterprise D, went to the other side of the world while Enterprise D kept going around in galaxy.  Turned back and as Miles O'Brian was trying to make Cardassian and Fedaration technology work together, I was dealing with a heart break. Odo went to join the link as I was entering quarantine and pondering what will happen. Captain Janeway and her crew was stranded on Delta Quadrant and I was dealing with lockdown. Voyager finale really let me down. Things got easier, we turned to a 2 weeks home 2 weeks office schedule and I met Captain Archer around that time. And tonight it ended.

Even without the Covid-19 outbreak, as if it is something which can be forgotten, this 22 months of my life was a really unforgottable period with all the losses and good memories and Star Trek was there nearly every day.

I'm trying to think of a favorite character but it's too hard to decide and not fair to others to pick one (not to you Wesley). So I can't really say a favorite character...but Miles O'Brien with Colm Meaney's great acting is hard not to mention. 

Series wise, DS9 has a special place in my heart. It was just perfect in many ways. In my country, Star Trek was never on TV a lot. I even learned existence of DS9 and Voyager around 2009. Even that time, the words ""Deep Space 9"" has such a ring that I was getting excited just by imagining the concept. 10 years lateri seeing the design of Terok Nor and watching the episodes only added to the excitement. I'm not sure if I'll ever feel that towards any fiction ever.

On all series, I found myself liking the episodes involving Klingons most. There is just something very good about a traditional, mean looking warrior race capable of space travel. I wish their other aspects were more discovered just like in the episode where Archer was on a trial had those conversations with his Klingon lawyer. I'm not going to even mention those iconic episodes like ""Inner Light"", ""On a pale moonlight"", ""Far Beyond the Stars"" and many more. They are already talked about a lot.

Since it's still very fresh, my thoughts slide to T'Pol and Trip. Was it really necessary to not let them have a happy ending? Thinking of it, who even got a happy ending in all series and movies? Maybe slightly Voyager crew..but that finale was just..nevermind. General tone of the production is very optimistic about future when compared to other sci-fi but characters all suffered in a way at the end.

&gt;Deanna Troi slowly awakens in a dark room, and is shocked to discover when she activates the room's light above a mirror that she has been surgically altered to appear Romulan. She doesn't know why or even where she is.

Disguised as Major Rekal, her chemistry with Commander Toreth (played by Carolyn Seymour who also put on a fantastic act) is very powerful. You could feel the tension everytime the two of them butted heads -- at the dinner table about Imperial training and on the bridge in front of the crew. I LOVED her speech to the bridge crew reasserting her and the Tal'Shiar's dominance with Toreth eventually being relied of duties.

Her interchanges with sub-commander N'Vek (also well-acted by Scott MacDonald) are equally gripping. Particularly enjoyable scenes include their initial banter over the predicament at hand, her scolding of N'Vek for destroying the Antares vessel, and them collaboratively devising a way for the Romulan ship to emit a traceable signal.

I normally don't pick apart episodes like this but this felt too big to gloss over.

The scientific implication of how Riker was split is massive and it's just shrugged off by everyone. I think it at least deserved a line in the episode where O'Brien or Geordi says that they're going to present their findings to Starfleet.

Basically, the Potemkin transporter chief ""doubled the transport carrier wave"" but it turns out they only needed one beam. One beam got through the atmosphere and beamed back a Riker. The other bounced back and rematerialized another Riker at the initial location.  


So, it seems to me there's a few implications:  
1) You can easily perfectly clone someone if they can reproduce the atmospheric conditions. (Which it seems they could do because they knew a lot about what was happening).

2) Because of that, Doubling the transporter carrier wave (or whatever) should have some MUCH tighter controls over. (Such as, making sure they don't both rematerialize!)

49,Need Help From Trekkies (And Maybe Some Whovians):,1600968721," I’m trying to make a fanfic where Uhura has a daughter who would later fall in love with the long-lost half-brother of Luke and Leia from “Star Wars” (it’s a long story). Yet, the problem is that I don’t know who the father should be. In the canon films, Uhura is still single so she’s probably divorced, widowed, is yet to find “the one” or devoted her time to her career. And since I want the fanfics to be loyal to canon, I’m not sure how Spock, Sulu or Scotty could be with her in this case. Perhaps Uhura did form a relationship with them and producing the daughter. But wouldn’t they have been any implications of that? Then there’s the matter of Sulu’s kid, Demora. If Uhura and Sula did marry, where would she come from? 

Then again, Uhura could’ve been in a relationship with either Riley or Walking Bear. Uhura could’ve had a kid with one of them and they retired from Starfleet to be a devoted stay-at-home dad. Or he could’ve died before the child was born or when she was only a little baby. 

 Other candidates would have been Adam Adamant from “Adam Adamant Lives!” (Adamant was a man from Edwardian man who was frozen in a block of ice by his girlfriend and his enemy. He is later thawed out in the 1960′s where he’s now 99-100 years old); Uhura would’ve been kidnapped and taken to the late 1960′s where she escapes into the streets of Britain. There, she would meet Adamant and his companions and slowly form a romance. Yet, with the Enterprise being strict with time-travel, would Uhura let herself be with a relationship of this kind? Would this even impact the timeline? 

Then there’s The Master from the Classic “Doctor Who”. In between the transformation of the 2nd Doctor becoming the 3rd, he could’ve been sent to help the Enterprise when The Master hypnotized half of the crewman (including Uhura) and starting a cult of sorts on a mysterious planet. All the while, The Master takes a liking to Uhura and brainwashes her into being his wife. Months later a baby was on its way. By the time the Enterprise finds her and the other victims, Uhura was 9 months in. Horrified by what The Master had done, The Doctor, Kirk and the others contemplate on what to do. In the end, Uhura’s mind is put back to normal by The Doctor, and she takes her revenge on The Master when he attempts to steal her newborn daughter. When asked by The Time Lords (who were notified by The Doctor) if she wants to keep the kid, Uhura chooses to do so and names her “Penda”. For the time, The Master is taken into custody until he escapes and gives up on taking Penda as he thinks confronting The Doctor is more important. I still don’t know if I should go with this story. A half-Whovian in a Star Trek world had a great deal of potential. Yet, would this be too dark? 

I could just have Uhura be with the 3rd Doctor but The Doctor and Uhura are both too responsible to get a relationship go too far. Besides, The Doctor would probably look at her as a child.

50,"I just rewatched ""Hard time"" (DS9) and it left me in shambles",1600967507,"Season 4, Episode 19.

It's not just the trauma Miles went through, it's the way they tell the story. He's clearly suffering, the moment when he almost attacks Molly hits hard. Because you know and love Miles, he's just a regular guy, who loves his job, his family and his best friend. Seeing him shattered and confused made me sad. But the best part of the episode is how they resolve it. Miles in the cargo bay, Bashir coming in at the last moment. Then they talk, and oh boy, does the murder scene hurt. Before the episode, Miles and Julian had a nice bromance going, with ups and downs, but mostly it was a cheerful story. ""Hard time"" shows that they're more than best buddies, they're friends for life. Julian loves Miles more than anybody else. When O'Brien returns to his family, you can see how much it means to him to be back home. He might have gone through hell, but now he's ready to face his demons. And he has realized that he's not alone. Colm Meaney also did an outstanding job in this episode. 

To me, ""Hard time"" is the epitome of Star Trek. It's about being human. It's about accepting your shortcomings while trying to do impossible things. And finally, it's about kindness.

(And also how he fought for Data's rights as a person and a father, but that's another post.)

Guinan didn't have any proof -- or even specifics -- just strong intuition that something was off. The expected reaction would be to brush her aside until some disaster pushed Picard into listening to her. Nope. He trusted Guinan and took her seriously when most people in his position would've been like, ""Come back when you have evidence.""

Same with Beverly. Even when I as an audience member thought, damn doctor has lost her mind, Picard believed her until far into the episode (by which time the audience is back on Beverly's side). 

And of course there is Troi's constant insight and advice (eye-rollingly obvious as it may be), which Picard values.

I love the portrayal of this kind of belief and respect of women, demonstrated time and time again by a powerful man. And all this back in the late 80s/early 90s. TNG showing yet again how relevant it still is. 

Ironic perhaps given the behind-the-scenes realities of the producers, etc. 

Nonetheless, it is a beautiful and refreshing thing to see these relationships that are so deeply rooted in mutual respect that the default reaction is to trust, not doubt, the word of women.

___

**Episode 8 - ""Veritas""**

* In a general sense, this episode borrows plot points from the series' namesake, TNG's ""Lower Decks,"" in which a group of ensigns contribute to the senior officers' plans but don't fully understand what's actually going on.
* Boimler laments missing pottery class. There was a sculpting class seen on the *Enterprise-D.*
* The ""trial"" copies several elements from the Klingon courtroom in *The Undiscovered Country* and ""Judgment:""
   * The defendants are raised into the chamber on a round platform, with a spotlight shining on them
   * The ""judge"" sits on a high perch in the shadows with onlookers watching from balconies
   * The ""prosecutor"" makes theatrical arguments and wears an eyepatch
* Clar is voiced by Kurtwood Smith, whose previous Trek credits include Annorax and Federation President Fu Manchu.
* Boimler's nomination for ""all-time biggest badass"" is Roga Danar, the fugitive supersoldier from ""The Hunted.""
* Mariner counters with Khan Noonien Singh, the plastic-chested space seed from *Into Darkness.*
* Earth is described as a place where all you do is ""hang out at vineyards and soul food restaurants."" The Picard family ran a vineyard in France; the Sisko family ran a Creole restaurant in New Orleans.
* The Neutral Zone is a buffer between the Romulan Empire and the Federation, and entering it is typically frowned upon. Freeman's map is a typical representation of the zone, with the Federation on the ""west"" and the Romulans on the ""east"" (in the Beta Quadrant). The Neutral Zone is usually well understood and it's not known why they would need to procure a map of it from a third party.
* ""Crazy Ivan"" is a naval maneuver not previously mentioned in the franchise, though it was highlighted in *The Hunt for Red October* (and Firefly).
* The EPS capacitors are part of the Electro Plasma System which forms a very large chunk of Treknobabble.
* Shaxs warns Rutherford again Denobulan flesh-eating bacteria. Denobulans are the polygamous puffer-fish folks most famously represented by Dr. Phlox. This is their first reference outside of ENT.
* Shaxs calls the unconscious Vulcans ""Spock"" and ""Spock."" Spock was the science officer aboard the *Enterprise* in the Kelvin films; Spock was Michael Burnham's foster brother in DIS.
* The shuttle the team uses to get to the museum is the same type seen in *The Motion Picture.*
* Vessels seen in the museum include:
   * a Type VI Starfleet shuttlecraft
   * a Ferengi shuttle, first seen in ""The Price""
   * a Jem'Hadar warship
   * a Klingon D7
   * a triangular pod and a yellow worker-beeish ship I'm too tired to identify
   * a rectangular slab which might be a Trek reference but may also just be the obelisk from *2001*
   * a 23rd-century Romulan bird-of-prey, complete with an actual bird painted on the belly
   * a Vulcan scout ship like the one seen in *First Contact*
   * a Class F Starfleet shuttlecraft
   * what *might* be a Tholian web-spinner
* Rutherford must distract the guard with a fan dance, just as Uhura did in *The Final Frontier.* Well, not *exactly* like Uhura did in *The Final Frontier.*
* Billups deliriously mumbles ""Mark Twain's got a gun,"" referencing the primary antagonist of ""Time's Arrow.""
* He then tries to warn Tasha that ""the garbage bag's behind you,"" likely a nod to Tasha Yar's unfortunate encounter with Armus in ""Skin of Evil.""
* Rutherford then wakes up at a Gorn wedding. The Gorn are primarily depicted as they were in their original appearance in ""Arena,"" and the scene also includes that episode's music and the Vazquez Rocks.
* Noticed by u/nauticalfiesta in a previous episode: the conference room's walls have the same design as that of the observation lounge during the back half of TNG.
* Ransom's team is threatened by one, two, three, four D'Deridex-class Romulan warbirds, introduced in ""The Neutral Zone.""
* Romulus was first mentioned in ""Balance of Terror"" and first seen in ""The Defector."" This episode takes place approximately one year after Romulan detente was established in *Nemesis,* and about seven years before the planet is destroyed by a supernova in *Star Trek 2009.*
* The Romulan guards complain about Remans. These were the Nosferatu toughs in *Nemesis;* their homeworld Remus can be glimpsed in an earlier establishing shot.
* Q (John de Lancie) is best known as the omnipotent villain/foil/rapscallion who irritated Picard throughout TNG; he also had a rapport with Janeway, and Sisko punched him once. Here he appears in his post-atomic horror judicial robes as he did when he was introduced in ""Encounter at Farpoint,"" and subjects the senior staff to an outlandish game as he did in ""Hide and Q"" and ""Qpid."" The crew must work together to overcome his challenge, clearly demonstrating that where they go one, they go all.
* Ransom hits on a salt vampire, the chameleonesque creature from ""The Man Trap.""
* T'Ana finds herself in a predicament where the crew is apparently being replaced by impostors. This mirrors ""Remember Me"" where Dr. Crusher notices the crew slowly disappearing; the flashback's establishing shot is of a starbase like Crusher's episode was.
* Boimler asks whether Kirk knew about ""that giant Spock on Phylos,"" a callback to ""Spock 2"" from ""The Infinite Vulcan.""
* He then wonders if Crusher knew about the Scottish ghost in the lamp, referencing ""The Visitor.""
* Boimler proclaims ""Drumhead!"" as he finishes his speech and horn-drops. In the episode ""The Drumhead"" Picard and crew are subjected to a witch-hunt trial and the captain saves the day by making one of his impassioned speeches.
* Clar was rescued from the Empire in what may be a stasis pod; members of the reunification underground were smuggled out in the same way in ""Face of the Enemy.""
* Q complains that Picard is always quoting Shakespeare. ""William Shakespeare"" is a pseudonym applied to a group of 16th-century authors, including Christopher Marlowe and Francis Bacon, who wrote dozens of plays now considered to be classics.",startrek,Antithesys,False,/r/startrek/comments/iywq7n/canon_references_veritas_spoilers/

64,Some things I don't get from the second season of Discovery,1600944666,"1. Everyone is convinced that the red angel is some very advanced future tech. Everyone on discovery seems to not know how such a phenomenon could occur. So how can it be that a time machine was invented 30 years prior?  How can discoveries scientists not figure out 30 year old tech?

2. How are time crystals theoretical and ""must has been perfected recently by a 4th dimensional race"" if they're growing naturally on the Klingon planet?

3. It's frequent mentioned that the suit has tech that is impossible and has a phenomenal power requirement that is unheard of. (For example when the angel disables the death lasers the Ba'ul are firing) where did this advanced impossible tech come from? We don't see anyone collecting it in the future.

4. Why did Starfleet send discovery to investigate the signals and the red angel when they knew what the red angel was all along?

5. Since when have nanites been a thing in startrek? Where did control get the future tech to make nanites? I don't think control time traveled.

6. Why even take discovery into the future when control got killed at the end?",startrek,happygiraffetim,False,/r/startrek/comments/iyuz2j/some_things_i_dont_get_from_the_second_season_of/
65,Just finished another rewatch of DS9. I have a question and an observation.,1600944243,"The question is: After the finale, what do you think the Romulans would do if they discovered the Federation lied to get them into the war? Let’s say they’re poring though the intelligence files at Dominion HQ on Cardassia and found proof the Federation lied. At this point the war is over and they won, but it was a lie that cost millions of Romulan lives. The Federation would argue that it was in the Romulans best interest to join the alliance. How would they react?


And the observation: Laas is probably dead. Odo unknowingly infected him with the changling virus when they linked, then Laas went off to search for other changlings. We know that changing form accelerates the progression of the disease and that Laas chose to change form a lot more than Odo did. He probably deteriorated very rapidly out in space somewhere and he’d have no way of knowing that Odo found a cure.",startrek,lmnjello,False,/r/startrek/comments/iyuw5h/just_finished_another_rewatch_of_ds9_i_have_a/
66,"I'm new to Star Trek, watching TNG. Just finished S3E15 Yesterday's Enterprise, and it moved me.",1600939285,"I am new to Star Trek, and wanted to give it whirl. I didn't pay much attention, since I was more focused on Star Wars as a kid, but I'm familiar enough through the cultural zeitgeist to respect the name of Gene Roddenberry. Having seen a small smattering of TOS episodes, decided I'd try TNG instead. Thoroughly enjoying what I'm seeing so far, and I'm up to season 3.

For those who need a refresher, Yesterday's Enterprise is the one with the rift in time that causes the Enterprise C to enter Picard's time during its battle with the romulans to defend a klingon outpost. The resultant defeat of the outpost restarts the Klingon-Federation war in Picard's time, making the Federation more militant and on the verge of losing the war. Guinan convinces Picard that the Enterprise C must return to that doomed battle and sacrifice itself to repair the rift in time. Picard correctly realizes that fighting the battle, and sending back Yar, who should be dead anyway, will repair/alter the course of history to create a Klingon/Federation alliance. At the last moment, Picard watches his crew die around him, defending a ship 22 years out her timeline, in the hopes that it saves the Federation from a timeline and scenario that shouldnt exist. What began as a sacrifice of the Enterprise C 22 years ago becomes an unsung sacrifice of the alternate timeline Enterprise D. And only Guinan remembers, asking Laforge about Yar, a woman she never met.

Yesterday's Enterprise was just so fucking good. The way characters discussed sacrifice in the face of inevitable odds, the expectation of a last stand by the Enterprise C becoming a sacrifice by the Enterprise D has me awestruck. Watching the crew die off, and Picard knowing that if he's right, he'll never actually see the timeline he is saving.",startrek,codamission,False,/r/startrek/comments/iytxx1/im_new_to_star_trek_watching_tng_just_finished/

Is this supposed leader of “Qanon” just a huge Trekie? Living his/their fantasy dreams of being part of the continuum?

81,Spock and TOS,1600912668,"My introduction into Star Trek was late last year when I started TNG after a coworker was amazed that I had never seen a single episode of Star Trek since it was right up my alley, and I loved it so much. When I finished it in the beginning of the year I moved on to TOS, which was a bit difficult for me to get into, and although I prefer the plots of TNG, by season 2 I got a real appreciation for TOS, and specifically Spock. Data was my favorite character of TNG, so naturally I figured Spock would be my favorite of TOS, but I didn't expect him to become my favorite character overall. His delivery, nonchalatness, logical drive, and sassy direct comments are the best. Data was logical like Spock, but he was always consumed with trying to understand why humans acted the way they did, whereas Spock either assumed he understood humans fully or just didn't care what they thought and continued on doing him without regard for social norms or personal perception.   


Spock was always observing and analyzing situations, circling through the phrases 'fascinating', 'curious', and 'interesting' indicating when and how something intrigued him, which would normally be missed or considered boring to most. I thought he used the phrases interchangeably, but over time I noticed that he used 'fascinating' when something happened that couldn't be explained by their known science, 'curious' when the facts of the situation were narrowing down leading to an explanation, and 'interesting' when something behaved or acted different from logical expectation. Spock's interactions with McCoy are hilarious and relatable since I as a science graduate student obsessed with data analysis and nerdy 'boring' stuff have been teased for my lack of interest and participation in most 'normal' things.  


In the episode ""The Ultimate Computer"" McCoy, annoyed with Spock's logical nature, digs at Spock for completely ignoring and and being seemingly uninterested in the fact that they are all about to die and is instead consumed with why the computer is behaving illogically. As he thinks out loud McCoy says, ""Please Spock, don't say its fascinating.""  And without missing a beat, Spock replies, ""No. But it is.. interesting.""  


Stupid McCoy, hahaha. This is one of the funniest moments in television for me, how can the writers be funny on so many levels, and its still funny 50+ years later.

4,Newbie here🖖🏾 Which show/movie introduced you to the Star Trek Universe and what are your fav?,1600884404,"
Currently watching Lower Decks after watching most of the series and what a great animation with a really impressive gag rate. Easter egg after Easter egg!

DISCO was my entry into the universe. Patiently waiting for S3 now. I loved it and it got me curious so I watched the JJ Abrahams films and I was hooked!

I then started watching them backwards moving onto ENT and I gotta say, I was so not ready for that switch from season-long story arcs to standalone episodes. After that awesome pilot which set insanely high expectations, I was so confused cos I expected the story to continue in the following episodes. Hated the format at first but slowly got used to it and now enjoy the show as it is. First seasons of ENT where disappointing and almost quit several times but these ST shows have a tendency to grow on you even with their mediocre starts... the nice thing about stand-alones is that you don’t miss much if you skip an episode. S3 and S4 were really good.. except for that last episode🤦🏾‍♂️  (I didn’t know who Riker was at the time and holodecks werent very familiar to me so I was super confused. wish they gave it a proper finish)

I noticed these older series are a bit harder to binge compared to the latest ones. I guess it should be obvious given their format. I then moved onto Voyager and loved it although I feel like some of the episodes could have been better told over 2 or more episodes. Some resolutions felt rushed. I then watched TNG and after skipping several episodes in the first two pretty boring seasons, it slowly became my fav... i think we can all agree that TNG theme is the official song for Star Trek. I then watched Picard after TNG and ... it was okay but felt like a wasted opportunity. Nothing memorable besides Easter eggs although It was a good set up for a new crew to start new things in S2 so let’s see where that goes.

... and then I moved onto DS9 😭 this is by far my Fav.  I was surprised this wasn’t more popular than it seemed to be. It has really good writing, rarely skipped episodes and has what feels like a much more realistic take on the utopia that is the Star Fleet and the Federation along with its flaws. Sisko is the best and most badass Capt in Star Fleet! VOY and DS9 seriously need DVD releases.

The older movies are pretty weak to be honest. They feel like very long episodes with a high budget. Wrath of Khan is really good though and I also enjoyed First Contact. 

Now I’ve just started TOS... and i can’t get past the very weird and disturbing first episode. Why the misogyny? And it’s got high ratings too ??? I know this show was made back when black people in the USA were only starting to be allowed to vote legally so I guess it makes sense. Question to any non-white Star Trek fans who might be reading this, is TOS worth watching?

Anyways if there’s other newbies there I’d love to hear your experiences. It’s interesting to see a lot of online debates. A lot of Star Trek YT channels I came across seem to be stuck in the TNG era and I rarely see content on the newer shows that doesn’t feel like just baseless hate.",startrek,vatezvara,False,/r/startrek/comments/iyfgjt/newbie_here_which_showmovie_introduced_you_to_the/

I started watching DS9 in July and have already finished it. Suffice it to say that I love DS9 even more. I was unsure of it when I watched the first episode, but by the end of season 1 I was certain that this show was going to be even more enjoyable than TNG, and I was right. 

After finishing up with DS9 (did that ending break anyone else's heart?) I was excited to start with VOY. After the first episode I thought that there wasn't a good character to latch onto like in TNG or DS9. Sure, Capt. Janeway was competent, but she wasn't really interesting. As the season went on I found that the same could be said for the other characters. 

I just don't find any of them interesting or even likable. Neelix is annoying, Tom Paris lacks depth, I found Chakotay's character to be very dated, and so on. Then I did some reading and discovered that the characters don't really change significantly over the series. At that point I figured that the show might not be for me.

Nonetheless, I have to ask the people of this forum; Does the show get better? I consider myself an avid Trekkie at this point, and I'm not about to give up on this show. What do you like about it? What's your favorite aspect of the show and why?

36,Something Bothering me About Yesterday's Enterprise,1600833754,"So I've seen the episode several times and saw it again on BBC America a few days ago. Great episode, seriously. I love Tricia O'neil as an actress and the 1701-C is my favorite Enterprise, I really like the design of the Ambassador class. They should give the C a series or movie, something! 

I feel like it was a time where they still were transitioning from the wild west days of Kirk and co. to the orderly, by the book Starfleet of Picard. And not insignificantly: To my knowledge, Rachel Garrett was the first and thus far ONLY woman to command Starfleet's flagship or any ship named Enterprise. That Castillo was kinda cute, too.

But one thing has always bothered me about the episode: The Enterprise C never fired it's weapons. Why? Picard had sent repair teams to assist the C's crew with getting combat systems online. Yar was there overseeing the work and showing the crew how to make their weapons and shields more effective. We were told at one point that most of the phasers were operational, but not all at full power.

It seems quite odd that the C failed to return fire either of the times it came under attack. Garrett was an experienced captain, presumably the best of her day given what ship she was commanding. Was she simply unable to give the order to return fire before she was killed (by a piece of resin from a Japanese model, not a very dignified way to go)? If that were the case why didn't Lieutenant Castillo give the order or do it himself?

Yes, the first attack happened quickly and Garrett was dead in moments. But what about the second attack? Picard literally sacrificed his Enterprise to save the C. That battle lasted more than long enough for the Enterprise C to get a few shots off and at least damage one of the Klingon ships. 

Maybe their weapons just weren't working at all. Then why would Yar or Castillo or Picard return the Enterprise C back into the vortex unarmed? The whole point of them going back in time was to out up a fight, to make a bold statement before they were lost, to show the Klingons that Starfleet had honor and could be a reliable ally. 

It was established that the weapons were functional. Not 100% but enough to defend itself from one Klingon ship at least.

I was recently watching the TOS episode ""The Omega Glory"", and I kind of wanted to cringe at the amount of ham-fisted U.S. propaganda was kind of cringe worthy.

The whole message of *A Private Little War* is that U.S. involvement in Vietnam, although regrettable, is necessary to maintain the balance of power. Two of the recurring villains in Star Trek TOS are the Klingons and the Romulans, stand-ins for the USSR and China respectably. However although it's safe to say that Star Trek TOS is very pro-American, I don't think it is safe to say that it is pro-capitalism simply because TNG, as well as movies 4 and 8 make it clear that the Federation does not operate on a capitalist economic model and actually operates on a *Moneyless* economic model.

51,Star Trek: First Contact theory,1600815841,"The gist of my theory: The Borg didn't travel back in time solely to assimilate the Earth of the past or destroy it--The Borg wanted to (1) give their 2063 counterparts an edge against Humanity and (2)  capture the Enterprise-E, Picard, and Data and return to the Prime timeline with them. 

We've seen time and again in Trek that the creation of parallel timelines is the usual result of altering the past. I don't think the Borg expected to destroy the Prime timeline Federation by  assimilating the Earth of the past. We got a glimpse of what that parallel universe would have looked like had the Borg succeeded.  

The main goal was to first draw the Enterprise into the battle (the Borg echoes in Picard's head at the beginning of the movie). They only sent one cube to Earth, knowing full well that it likely couldn't withstand an attack by the Sector 001 fleet plus the Ent-E. Shortly after the Ent-E arrived, the cube was destroyed. The cube then sent its primary weapon back--the time warping sphere--as a lure and hook for Picard's Enterprise.

Getting the Ent-E back to 2063 would have been the perfect way to isolate and take over the ship without the support of other Federation vessels. The Borg sent other echoes to Picard while he was down on the planet, and drew him back to the ship before shutting down communications and transporters. 

Going back to 2063 was also the perfect way to gain intel on a semi-advanced, nearly warp-capable humanity before Earth had support from Vulcan and other civilizations. 

The Queen was just an advanced drone with (1) the ability to lead the Borg crew without support from a 24-century collective and (2) seductive capabilities. The Borg wanted Picard and Data--and the Ent-E--and return with them to the 24th century to improve their capabilities in the Prime Timeline. With Data, the Queen was very nearly successful. She was going to seduce Data, and break Picard.

Other strong evidence the Borg intended to return to the 24th century: they left an escape temporal wake the Enterprise was able to use to get back.

Before I only saw reboot movies and some episodes of DS9 but that was long time ago. I decided to watch it from the beginning because that's just how I like to get into new things, I don't want to miss anything.

I have finished TOS, watched some episodes of TAS and first 4 original movies. Then I jumped to the beginning of TNG (I know that it is recommended to watch first 6 movies before TNG, but I'm watching by production order).

To be honest I'm not sure what to think about it. Generally, I enjoy it very much. But on the other hand, I'm very often just bored. The quality of stories is very very uneven. I really liked some TOS episodes like Balance of Terror for example, but most of it wasn't that great. Now, after Encounter at the Farpoint, I saw entirely new quality and I know that I'm going to continue watching it. The episode was amazing and seeing McKoy again was great for me because it was probably my favorite character from TOS.

So to wrap it up, I know that I'm going to continue watching it anyway, but I'm curious if it will satisfy my expectations. I'm hoping for something, I don't know how to name it, but ""big"". I didn't like episodes with some random villages and generic storylines. I want to know this world better, I want some longer story arcs, character development, some big scale events and the status quo to change sometimes.

Hello everyone¡ I´m working on a fan edit of Star Trek: Nemesis. It is well known that the deleted scenes were cut mostly to give the film a more commericial appeal and more action, but they could have made a much better movie. My edit cuts most of the redundant and worst scenes while trying to recover the missing scenes, at least the best ones that could fit properly in the movie.

[https://i.imgur.com/vvUDCHf.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/vvUDCHf.jpg)

Other people have tried to make a fan edit of the last of TNG movies, but the greatest problem is the really low quality of the avaliable footage of the deleted scenes. They suffer from very low resolution, interlacing, bad edge enhacement and wrong aspect ratio. In addition, some of them have green screens that were purposed to be replaced with VFX in post-production.

**Here is a list of all the deleted scenes avaliable:**

I have made a lot of progress towards creating this ""Actor´s Cut"" of Star Trek: Némesis. But the costs are important, i have already spent more than 600$ and hundreds of hours in this project and i won´t be able to pay the costs of the following needed steps:

**-Removal of the credit letters in 3 of the improved deleted scenes:** This needs to be made frame by frame, using painting and masking methods to cover the credits and replacing them with extended textures from surrounding parts in each frame, as the camera is moving, especially in two of that scenes

.-**Improvement on the stereo track of the used deleted scenes:** The audio track that we find in the deleted scenes is a mediocre stereo track that needs to be fixed by makingthe voices smoother and more clear, plus removing the weird background sound.

**-Music for the deleted scenes:** Ofc, the deleted scenes need their own music. There´s a need to chose the proper music for each scene.

I have worked with an VFX and Video Fixing specialist that helped me to fix the video in most of the deleted scenes. I will put a ""before and after"" video soon so you can check it.

Hope you enjoyed the read and don´t be shy to comment or help with any proposals and opinions.

78,Lower Decks is great but the character of Mariner is ruining it.,1600734604,"I’m genuinely enjoying Lower Decks. I don’t care that for the most part I don’t find it rolling on the floor funny, I just enjoy the lighthearted romp through the TNG world which so far avoids the often pretentious and uningratiating Trek of today. 

However what is going on with Mariner? It’s clear her character is supposed to be cool, and laid back, funny and low key genius, but she comes off as annoying, patronising, condescending and downright dangerous. 

I keep hoping that she will be taught some lesson, or she will make a mistake, or have some kind of flaw beyond being too damn clever and not caring. Occasionally she portrayed as this, but usually it’s just a ruse to get out of taking responsibility or proving she’s better in some way than an uptight typical ‘starfleet’ character. 

Some may feel people have a problem with her‘strong character’. Quite the contrary. I think her characterisation is in fact weak and contradictory. If she hates starfleet so much why is she there? Does she secretly believe in starfleet’s values but is on a massive rebellious streak from her starfleet parents? Or is starfleet the only life she’s known and she’s deep down too scared to break away? 

All good characters have flaws, it’s how we emphasise with them. Picard is an awesome captain, but lacks a family, or ability to operate in the informal world. Ezri Dax was an old confident person in a young and insecure mind. Data couldn’t crack a joke. Tilly’s social awkwardness, Riker’s daddy issues. Mariner’s cockiness, laziness and arrogance appeared (perhaps unintentionally) as flaws to begin with, but now as the series progresses it seems we should be rooting for the character despite this?

They assimilate others into their own culture, and strive for both technological superiority... and, from their perspective, for “melting pot” equality and eliminating class distinctions.  

The Borg appear menacing to almost all other groups, so much so that unlikely alliances will form just to oppose the Borg, they themselves do not regard themselves as hostile.  

The Borg are connected by a hive-mind network of shared real-time communication via mobile networking — high-speed wireless broadband and a dominant social network. This connectivity has also been used to exploit and overcome the Borg in several notable battles.

In Star Trek, the Borg represent a large, aggressive and imperial adversary.  US audiences were unlikely to catch on that this adversary was themselves. Instead, they perhaps likened the Borg to other perceived adversaries like Russia or China, which did not generally absorb other cultures and assimilate their people into a new synthetic culture.

Eventually, it is revealed that that Fenna is a mental projection from the unhappy wife of an eminent scientist, who is docked at the station.


A dull mystery/romance, which is rather by the numbers. What stands out in this episode is that eminent scientist, Gideon Seyetek. He is a wonderful character who chews scenery in a way I have rarely seen. The best way to describe him is that Tim Curry ‘Spaaace!’ clip from Red Alert 3, but somewhat believable as an actual human being.


He is a complete, self-confessed, egomaniac. Normally in Star Trek, characters with egos the size of Ceti Alpha V are villains, or at least somewhat antagonistic, think Gul Dukat, or Gowron. Seletekbreaks this mold by not only being a fellow with the best intentions, but soles the central issue of the episode with a real 200 IQ move.


Problem: His wife is obviously unhappy in their marriage, causing the psycho-projections. These psychoprojections will kill her if she keeps doing it. They can’t just divorce (like he has been nine times before), because members of his wife’s race mate for life.


Solution: Careen yourself into a dead star, reigniting it in the process. With Seyetek dead, his wife is free to move, and find true happiness with someone else.

While I agree with TOS being at the top, I'd rather watch it, DS9, VOY or even ENT than TNG.

Maybe it's my age? I'm 52. So, I grew up with and loved TOS in reruns and the first four movies until I was in college and TNG came out. So yeah, as there was a little resentment at this new upstart bunch. But, mostly it was the painful cheesiness of season 1 that turned me off. The costumes in Code of Honor and Justice (not to mention Troi's hair and onesie) and the creature effects in Conspiracy were like something barfed up by the worst of TOS. At least TOS had nascent special effects and sixties fashion to blame. What was TNG's excuse?

33,Am I the only one who can't get past the Cerritos' ship design on Lower Decks,1600660657,"OK, this bis gonna be the nerdiest complaint I have ever written, but.... 

I have an issue here that I can't get past: the ship design of the Cerritos. I can't be the only one, but I have never seen this brought up anywhere.

The Star Trek ship design language has mostly been (more in the ""mostly"" in a moment) that there are pairs of nacelles that act as the warp field generator.
 
The design descriptions I have read is that the nacelles are paired because an energy field runs between them. It also has been stated that you cannot have anything between the two nacelles because it would get destroyed by the energy field. In fact, the reason that Voyager's nacelles moved back into position during warp speed was because of this. (I have no idea why the Voyager nacelles had to move in the first place, but that's a different post.)

At any rate, the class of ship that the Cerritos belongs two has it's engineering hull right between the nacelles. Not sorta between them, but right between them.

I know ST has had some inconsistent one-offs, like the three nacelle starship that Riker was captaining during TNG's All Good Things finale, but it was quietly swept under the table and never mentioned again. Lower Decks puts this design inconsistency as the main ship of a TV series.

For all the callbacks, name dropping, and Easter eggs this show has you would think someone on staff would have realized this design was a inconsistent with the ST universe.

I feel like I should just quit while I’m ahead.  Or at least separate my experience of those shows from the rest of it.  Like I feel like the trilogy of TNG, DS9, and VOY are their own story.  And it all comes together in the end a lot like how the avengers movie infinity saga played out. 

From everything I’ve heard Enterprise is kind of a bummer.  I get that their finale tries to tie into TNG but i can already anticipate how it will feel annoying.  Should I just not watch it and let Star Track live in my heart as it ended with voyager?   What’s the cost/benefit analysis?

Obligatory I’m on main and throwaway (my crewmates are on here)

So during a transporter accident two of my crew members were fused into one being. Our Doctor could not find a way to fix the condition, so we had to acknowledge this could be long term. 

After a few weeks he seemed to be enjoying his life and forming bonds with the crew. He was even a better cook and tactical officer than his ‘parents’.

Here’s the part where I might be TA. Our doctor figured out how to separate the two people from the one so we could get them back. But the fused crew member decided he wanted to live. I had to decide what the outcome should be, and decided it would be best for our two people to return as opposed to the one. 

So AITA for forcing a sentient man to sacrifice his life for the lives of two others?  Did I really execute him, or was it justified?

90,"The Enterprise has 5 Year Missions, and Changes so Much, Because it is Refit Every 5 Years",1600549277,"The TOS/TAS/DIS/TMP Enterprise (which is the only ship I will be talking about when I say ""Enterprise"" to avoid the ambiguity displayed in the second word of this sentence) has a complicated history. It has at least 5 separate designs (6 if you count Ephraim and Dot), 3 series, a movie, and over 50 years separating it's various depictions. This leads to a lot of things that don't make a lot of sense at first glance. I propose that all the discrepancies are caused by the same thing that gives Constitution class ships 5-year missions: the growing Federation.

I first got the idea of this when I noticed that TOS and TAS, shows about the ""first"" 5-year mission, take place over a period of 6 years. Specifically 2265-2270. Now you may be thinking ""hey wait a minute, that's 5 years!"" But depending on when in 2265 they started that's actually 6. 2265, 66, 67, 68, 69, and 70. Add to that the fact that TAS seems to be a slightly different journey (more advanced ship with slightly diffrent crew) and that got me thinking. So let's start at the begging of the Enterprise.

2245) The Enterprise is launched under captain Robert April. Ok wow, 45 is an easy number to work with for 5-year missions. This is a voyage we never see, and the next point in history is

2250) When Christopher Pike takes command. This is how we know Robert April had a 5 year mission as he is still alive latter in TAS, so Pike was promoted from first officer and didn't take command due to the death of a captain. We see exactly one hour of this voyage: The Cage in 2254. This makes the 2nd refit on the Enterprise with the larger deflector dish and slightly different nacelles from Kirk's TOS ship. We can also confirm this is near the end of the 5-year voyage as Pike is considering resignation in the begging of The Cage, Almost like he knows he's got to be a boop-chair latter.

2255) Now this 5-year mission would have ended in 2255, but that's also the year the Klingon War breaks out. We know Pike was forced to sit out the war, so I propose the admiralty extended the mission due to the war. This may seem strange but we know Pike was kept out because Starfleet wanted the best to survive if they lost the war, and that was Pike. The Enterprise is also 5 years out of date (more on why that matters latter), and the next refit is quite an extensive one. Therefore he was kept out of the war, but in frustration Pike stayed very close to the Federation (probably against orders) in case he had to return home and fight.

2257) The Klingon War is ended (just don't ask how), and the Enterprise can finally return home for it's long overdue refit, a refit which takes place during the peace talks. This is the Enterprise's 3rd refit and is the ""Disco-prise."" Ignoring the size of Discovery ships (as you probably should), this is a fairly substantial refit, yet not as large as the 18-month TMP one to come. So provided we have a few months between the end of the war and Discovery leaving for Vulcan everything is good time-wise. They also likely had all the parts waiting for the Enterprise as it was supposed to be refit right when the war started. This refit is also the cause of the Excelsior cosplay, I mean technical problems the Enterprise has for most of season 2.

2258) We know the Enterprise doesn't get a new 5 year mission until at least this year becouse Pike is off on Discovery dealing with the red signals. I'm also going to assume SNW starts right after season 2 of Discovery, which is either 2285 or 59 depending on how long the inquiry into Control takes. This is when the 3rd 5 year mission starts under Pike, and will be the events of SNW.

Late 2263/Early 2264) This is when the mission ends and Pike is promoted to Fleet Captain, what could possibly go wrong? The Enterprise is refit yet again into the TOS Enterprise and Kirk takes command. Sometime in 2264 the 5-year mission starts. Now TOS starts in 2265 but it doesn't make sense for that to be the first mission for Kirk. It doesn't feel like the first time out for anybody at any point in the first season. The Enterprise has clearly been out for a little bit by 2265 and everybody is comfortable under Kirk.

2269) This is the end of Kirk's 1st Five year mission and the 4th for the ship. Soon after TOS ends the Enterprise returns to earth for it's most minor refit and undergoes some crew transfers. Depending on how you want to treat TAS tech, This is when the Enterprise gets a holodeck and all it's fancy toys like force-filed spacesuits and whatnot. Why did they get rid of those latter is still an issue but not one I'm creating.

2273) Hey, wouldn't you know it. This is the year TMP happens. It's almost like I', right :). Now strictly speaking the Enterprise undergoes an ""18-month refit"". But I think the early 2270s was an important era for Starfleet and I'll get into that latter. Needless to say the last 5-year mission was cut short buy a year for this massive refit. Incidentally TWoK is 12 years away so there is ample  time to account for any changes in the bridge between the movies. The A is built in 2286 and Star Trek VI is 2291 so the same logic applies. You have to ignore Star Trek V if you want that to work, but you should ignore that movie anyways.

Now we've covered how the Enterprise was refit but we still have the question: why? Well fro that we have to go WAAAAY back to 2161, the Founding of the Federation. As we see in The Pegasus, The Federation instantly makes the NX, and presumably all other ships for all races, obsolete. The introduction of 3 other species technology causes a massive technological leap, or at the very least a blending of the best tech from the Four founding members. And there's the key, ""Four Members"" And across what, maybe a dozen planets? According to Memory Alpha ""By 2267 the Federation 'was on a' thousand planets, some 100 years latter... over 150 member worlds."" Assuming for a moment that there's linear growth by the time of Discovery there would be around 70 members to the Federation. That is almost a member every year! Each one with their own technology and experience. In other words every 5 years the Federation is getting the equivalent of it's original 4 members again. Every ship in the fleet could use a refit after that time. And remember at 12 years the Shenzhou is considered old. Each 5 year mission also leads to more discoveries of it's own, which can be incorporated in the next refit.

Theirs a catch though. When your Earth, the addition of the other 3 founding members is massive. However when your 70 members on 1,000 worlds and you get 4 more that's not a big deal. Particularly when you consider the Alpha/Beta quadrants are pretty much on par with each other when it comes to tech as a whole. So buy the 2270 The Federation isn't getting as much out of each new member. Therefore I propose Starfleet, sometime in the late 2260s, decided enough was enough. They were going to take their ships (which probably look as messy as Deep Space Nine inside) and standardize things. Come up with the best materials and designs and just stick with them. You still have to send your ships on missions (hence that 4-year 5-year mission), but it's just not feasible to recall the entire fleet every few years for increasingly minor refits anymore. This is where we get the TMP era, and ships that start lasting a centery. The Miranda, Excelsior, Oberth, and Constellation become staples of the Federation through the Dominion War 102 years latter. We even see an Excelsior welcome Voyager home in 2378! Starfleet finally stops worrying about an aging fleet and can roll out new ships gradually like the Ambassador and Galaxy class. It isn't until the Federation is seriously threatened by the Borg and latter the Dominion that they ramp their Ship design process up to 11, but even then the Inquiry class isn't that different from a Sovereign when you consider how much things changed from Ent to TMP.",startrek,Official_N_Squared,False,/r/startrek/comments/iw0q46/the_enterprise_has_5_year_missions_and_changes_so/

Just came across this where the YTer used an AI developed by Google and Academics in China and California to uprate his 15fps Stop-motion videos to 60fps.

He claims there to be zero artifacts but that isn't the case.

I wonder if going from a source with a higher frame rate would be better and how well it would perform regarding the DS9 Upscale project - I can't recall its proper name if it has one.

I wonder if it would be the best solution regarding the variable frame rate source material in converting it all to 60fps rather than ""settling"" for 30fps.

I'm not sure how it would handle the 25(??)fps scenes though, whether it needs a round number of frames (15&gt;30&gt;60 is good, but 25&gt;60 isn't).

I would assume that it would work better with a higher resolution source so it would probably need to be used after the frames have been upscaled.

Each dice roll determines the difficulty level for each 'level', but it's ultimately up to the four player characters to determine whether or not you finish each level (if Dax hadn't figured out the hopscotch level, the game would have ended there.) 

A bad roll means a more difficult level. Rolling a 1 (as Quark obviously did in Bashir's case) 'kills' one of your characters.

Off the top of my head...

* The Caretaker - I don't know what it is about it, but it was a well made pilot episode. Even 25 years later, it remains one of the single most expensive episodes of TV ever produced and felt almost like a nice little science fiction B film.
* Future's End I &amp; II - They end up in 1996 California chasing after a ship from the far future. It's a lot of fun to watch because it can't be taken too seriously. I'm no fan of Sarah Silverman but her presence in these two episodes makes them pretty fun.
* Blink of an Eye - This is the one where Voyager ends up orbiting a planet where time is experienced faster on the surface than it would be in space. The residents on the surface spot a light in the sky and spend the next few hundred years evolving, constantly trying to determine what this object is in the sky.
* Real Life - I don't care for episodes about family, but this one was good. It managed to be really funny but then really sad and offered great development for The Doctor.

There are probably others, but these are definitely the ones that immediately come to me. Unpopular opinion as well: Year of Hell sucked.

I got into Enterprise for a time, and am definitely planning on binging that again sometime soon.

I DID however get into Stargate (all 3 series) and I absolutely love Battlestar Galactica (the reboot), my favorite Sci-Fi show of all time. 

Which Star Trek series would I like the most? Which should I start with? Excluding TOS, tbh. I just can't get into it, it's too dated for me. I'm thinking Voyager, a middleground between being not-too-dated and not-too-cheesy. My dad was never really into DS9, so I've always assumed I wouldn't like it (unreasonably). I should also note that I'm in (what I understand to be) the large minority in that I love Nemesis, it just stuck with me as a kid and now it's pure nostalgia for me.

First off, the original Starfleet Command is a great game that still holds up, even if it's graphics look like they're rendered in cardboard. You can install it, go to skirmish, and make yourself a 9 on 9 fleet battle between any of the TOS factions they included. I just went three rounds in a half hour and it's honestly probably, pound for pound, the best currently downloadable Star Trek game available. Go watch the Battle of the Binary Stars and set yourself up a round, it's real fun I promise!

Next up, Star Trek Bridge Crew. Looks really cool and fun, but I lack a VR headset and playing without one was, for me at least, basically impossible. I imagine it's better with friends and with the appropriate equipment, but unless you've already got those it's kind of hard to justify buying it.

Star Trek Online has been around for a while, and you likely already know it. It's an MMO on the decline and I haven't personally played the expansions, but there is plenty of trek themed content around a serviceable MMO that once upon a time admirably carried the burden of being our only way to play past the end of Voyager in the prime timeline. And hey, some of the stories are cool! (It's great for people who love buying lootboxes!)

53,Why Is This So Hard? We Just Want Simple Trek...,1600452213,"I've been talking with friends lately and Star Trek came up. At least in our group, we're fascinated by what we feel is a disconnect between the powers that control it and many fans.

Obviously we don't speak for everyone, but my friends group is really diverse across a large age range, gender, backgrounds, etc. All of us agreed on a few points:

Get us a show like Next Generation, but just keep going. Forget this shoe-horning of trying to go over the same periods we've already seen, or prequels. Pike? Eh. Maybe it'll be good, but not one of us is excited about it. 

Second, think SNL and by that I mean continuation. Take the show and make it a revolving cast. Every year cycle in a new character to the ship/show and let an older one move on. The big ones stay 4-7 years or so, but ultimately let them move up and on with cameos moving forward. We'd all watch. Sure, some cycles might not be as good, but many will be better than ever. 

Third, STICK TO FREAKING CANON. None of us like what JJ Abrams did. We love these characters and this universe for what it is. Period. Spock running around emotional, in love, jealous is NOT SPOCK. The new Pike series scares the crap about of us as in interviews the new guy playing the young Spock is like, ""because he's younger we'll be able to explore more about his being less polished"". No! How do you not understand Vulcans yet??? Every so often having a challenge? Sure, but a reckless Spock isn't Spock. You might as well just create a new character. 

More than anything else get rid of these people that don't understand Roddenberry's core points about why Star Trek worked in the first place. How these people like Berman and such end up in control of the property is just mind blowing. Even when they think they have new ideas they can't even follow through. Take Voyager. It had all the ingredients and two of the best characters in the Trek world (in Seven and the Doctor), but the writers couldn't ever let go of Earth. The whole point of the show was that they were entirely lost in a new quadrant of space and yet every season we had to get shows about Earth or shows that pulled in favorite races of the Alpha quadrant.

59,Star Trek Picard - and why i am not a fan of it,1600445852,"This is an opinion piece about PIC and contains some spoilers about VOY, you have been warned. It also might be considered a rant.

&amp;#x200B;

Plot holes and similar problems that plague almost all modern shows these days no withstanding (not to mention that Star Treks record in that regard was never stellar to begin with), i am right now watching VOY:Endgame and realized that something i did read about Seven of Nine and her relationship to Janeway that one of the producers said is total Bogus:

(If someone finds the link to it, please notify me, as i was unable to!)

They basically said that they did not think that the relationship between Seven of Nine and Janeway was all that important or all that close in Voyager.

Yet here i am watching Endgame, were Future and Current Janeway have a little exchange about saving others or saving the crew, and the first thing that Future Janeway does to shut up Present Janeway is tell her about Seven of Nines death, which does give her pause immediately,

Also, Future Janeways reaction when Seven enters the sickbay is not one i would expect from someone that would not care about her.

I think that Seven of Nines role and her quest of becoming human is very much a similar theme to that of Datas quest, yet other than Data Seven of Nine often enough went more directly against Janeways wishes and the dynamic between the two is a definite plus to the entire show.

In the end i think their relationship is one of the most important elements of the show, especially as Seven is standing outside the rank order and is showing a very different approach to handling things, as her view on the universe is very different than that of rest of the crew.

Yet in the end, both Janeway and Seven share a deep bond of mutual respect and friendship. Especially Janeway does go through a very important development that in the end also grounds her a bit against the possibility that her role as captain gets to her head to much (captains of ships in ancient past and the future come directly after god and i think that without Seven Janeway might have started to belive this herself. Especially Endgame and the Future, cynical Janeway brings it to the point when she states that the crew is blinded by devotion).

And in the end i find the way that some of the characters were treated in PIC simply not to my liking. And while on the one side am glad that we did not get a carbon copy of TNG with the new show, i think that in general Star Trek needs to have more Star Trek in it and be a bit more bold in exploring new themes, yet stay more in line with the original vision. DSC did that when they refused to blow up the enemy at the end, where they stated they are Starfleet and this is not how they operate.

PIC basically in my opinion was some generic, dystopian Sci-Fi and other than having some of my favorite actors in it, not very original or noteworthy and a far cry from past Star Trek glory.

Heck, i like DSC more and that says something. PIC is also the first Star Trek show which i could not stomach to rewatch after the first completion (i did rewatch single episodes during the release though, as i always do and oh btw.: stop the bullshit weakly releases ffs).

After being reluctantly promoted, he relentlessly reacquired command of the Enterprise when V'Ger threated.  He'll break simulation code, starfleet regs, General Orders, and bend the Prime Directive to his will if he decides something's important enough.
* Ravenclaw:  Kirk is an intellectual--the ""stack of books with legs"" in his Academy days, as Gary Mitchell related.  His favorite pastime is reading, and he is self-directed student of history and lover of antiques.  His victory over the Gorn in ""Arena"" was a pure Ravenclaw solution.

4,Watching Stargate SG1 as a lifelong Trek fan is so frustrating,1600351195,"Growing up, TNG was on the television. While I watched enough to know I liked it, I didn't really follow things all that closely, particularly since I was basically still a kid. As an adult I decided I'd start at the beginning with TOS and I watched everything that was available that Trek had to offer (minus the Animated Series for some reason). 

I went from TOS to Continues (non canon but awesome). From Continues to TNG. TNG to DS9 (still my favorite). DS9 to VOY. VOY to ENT and ENT to DIS (which was just about to start its 2nd season I think). I love everything about what Trek represents and, with a few exceptions, enjoyed watching it all. 

I've since done a rewatch of DS9 and I'm mid way through Season 5 of my rewatch of VOY. 

A friend recommended Stargate to me. A little background made me think it would scratch similar itches as Trek would - Aliens, space travel, exploration...sure why not!

Then I started watching. As Trek fans we all know the Prime Directive is king. Don't interfere with the natives (particularly pre-warp species), don't violate their laws, don't push your beliefs onto the natives...ALL THINGS SG-1 DOES EVERY DAMN MISSION.

SG-1 visits a planet where women are subservient to men and what do they do? Carter bucks tradition, causes a revolt and fundamentally alters the culture of the species. 

SG-1 visits a planet where they live for 120 days and worship a statue as if it were their God. What does SG-1 do? Your beliefs are wrong and topple the statue causing them an undoubted existential crisis. 

SG-1 has no First Contact protocols, no appreciation for not interfering with natives and no sense of responsibility for the implications of the things they do while interacting with native species (admittedly the other species are almost all human but may as well be alien all things considered). There's been some serious questionable decisions made too like leaving sentient robot versions of themselves on a planet for example.

I'm not saying what SG-1 attempts to do is wrong or ill intended...they just don't stick around long enough to know how the changes they are implementing will play out. Furthermore they don't seem to think about the long term implications at all!

So far I like Stargate. Its a decent piece of Sci-Fi and after having watched the first season I'm sure I'll continue. That being said, as a Trek fan - it is super frustrating to watch just how little they seem to regard the customs, cultures and people they find whenever they jump through the gate to a new planet...or how what they do while on that planet will affect those customs, cultures and people long term.",startrek,RyoOfWildFire,False,/r/startrek/comments/iuk0ci/watching_stargate_sg1_as_a_lifelong_trek_fan_is/

**Episode 7 - ""Much Ado About Boimler""**

* Dogs have been kept as pets by several characters including Janeway, Picard, and most famously Jonathan Archer. Archer's beagle Porthos was implied, in one timeline at least, to have suffered a fate similar to The Dog's fellow freak Boimler by falling victim to a transporter accident.
* Another loose connection to ENT can be seen when The Dog turns into a spider-demon and scampers up the wall; in ""Doctor's Orders"" Phlox mentions having seen *The Exorcist* during an NX-01 movie night.
* The story involving Freeman and other senior officers being temporarily reassigned for a covert mission echoes ""Chain of Command"":
   * the ninja outfits they wear are the same worn by Picard and his team
   * their mission involves rulot seeds, established in ""The Homecoming"" as a Cardassian plant; Picard's team investigated Cardassian operations
   * the officers in both episodes were picked specifically for their unique expertise regarding the mission objectives
   * Freeman is replaced by another captain, just as Picard was replaced
   * Picard's replacement, Edward Jellico, is name-dropped by Mariner
* Boimler is ""phased"" in the transporter, something that happened to Geordi and Ro in ""The Next Phase,"" although in that episode the phasing involved the victims being able to pass through objects (except, you know, the floor, and the oxygen they needed to breathe).
* Rutherford calculates Boimler's phasing as ""one millicochrane."" The cochrane is a common technobabble unit of measurement ostensibly used to describe distortions in subspace fields.
* The sub crew's Lt. Pratchett (name source undetermined) is a Rigelian, long-mentioned but first seen in ""Affliction."" Pratchett is played by legendary voice actor Maurice LaMarche, making his canon Trek debut here.
* We've previously explored the trinkets in Freeman's ready room, but unnoticed until this week is what looks to be a statue (or action figure) of a Gorn as introduced in ""Arena.""
* The design of the *Osler* is very likely taken from that of the battleships of Warhammer 40k.
* The *Osler* might be named after William Osler, one of the founding physicians of Johns Hopkins. I absolutely made this connection myself and definitely did not just look up the disambiguation on wikipedia.
* The D14 operative is a member of the same species as Arex, the *Enterprise* navigator during TAS. Although not explicitly linked to Arex in canon, the name of his race is accepted by most official sources as Edosian.
* The Edosian wears an outlandish piece of futuristic technology usually called a ""face mask.""
* Ramsey claims her team fought off four Borg using ""Vulcan jiu-jitsu."" A Vulcan martial art known as suus mahna was featured in ENT and DIS.
* Mariner mentions a professor named Saul Rubichik; this is suspiciously close to Saul Rubinek, whose early career included the role of Kivas Fajo in ""The Most Toys.""
* The freaks include
   * The leader, who suffers from both rapid and reverse aging. Rapid aging was explored in ""The Deadly Years"" and ""Unnatural Selection"" while de-aging was featured in ""The Counter-Clock Incident"" and ""Rascals.""
   * Ensign Jenna was exposed to delta radiation, and appears to have been given the standard treatment: confinement to a boop chair, just as Christopher Pike was in ""The Menagerie.""
   * Ellis and Sanderson were merged in a transporter accident, though not quite as seamlessly as Neelix and Tuvok were in ""Tuvix."" At least they get to live.
   * ""Anthony,"" who has apparently turned into the same salamander creature that Sisko evolved into during ""The Visitor.""
* Magnetic boots were previously seen in *The Undiscovered Country,* *First Contact* and the occasional ENT episode.
* There have been a number of designs of Type 3 phaser rifles, but the one the Edosian grabs seems to most closely resemble the one seen in *First Contact.*
* The *Rubidoux* implodes to reveal a giant glowing space jellyfish, no doubt of the same species as those seen in ""Encounter at Farpoint.""",startrek,Antithesys,False,/r/startrek/comments/iuihwd/canon_references_much_ado_about_boimler_spoilers/
8,Diversity on the ship,1600345128,"Is it just me, or does the animated Enterprise seem to have the most diversity of all the primary ships we've seen as far as Starfleet personnel goes? The Enterprise and Enterprise A had tons of humans and Spock, who was half human in the first place. What little we saw of the Enterprises B and C were all human (unless I'm forgetting something). 

The Enterprise D had a klingon officer and an android officer. After a while, a bajoran officer shows up intermittently. Oh, and we can't forget the Bolian barber. DS9, despite being a station that ended up being a transit hub was all humans with a few bajorans on loan (since Bajor wasn't officially a part of the Federation yet) and eventually got the Enterprise D's klingon. Even the brief time Nog was in the academy ended up with him being out because of his leg.

Voyager took off as all human, eventually revealed they had a vulcan, and adopted a few bajorans  and yet more humans. 

Enterprise NX01, being all humans and a beagle with a vulcan and denobulan on loan at least makes sense, because it was the beginning.

And Discovery... no offense to the tremendous acting of Doug Jones, but honestly, after watching Enterprise, I was irked to, yet again, see the past of Star Trek showing us species that didn't come up in later series'. Granted, that got explained away, but couldn't they have given us some members of the Federation that have been in there for a while that HAVEN'T HAD MUCH SCREEN TIME AT ALL?

The animated series not only still had Spock, but that cat girl, an andorian, and at least one or two others whose species I never learned. And even if they didn't get much screen time or all that many lines compared to the Big Three, at least it showed the Enterprise being a Federation ship, and not a human ship that's a member of the Federation.",startrek,Dudeness77,False,/r/startrek/comments/iuiazp/diversity_on_the_ship/

11,Why is Star Trek: Enterprise hated so much?,1600330397,"As a pre-note, I have seen TOS, TNG, Voyager, and just finished Enterprise. None of the ""old"" movies have been seen and only 2 of the new ones.

As I watched each Star Trek series, I actually must say that I felt each Captain had their own personalities and a unique handling of their crew (as they should) but i started with the opinion of the usual TOS over TNG but Picard over Kirk. 

As I explored Janeway (for some reason) I shifted to Picard AND TNG over Kirk and TOS (no hate on Kirk, he's great). But as a woman Captain and her lovely overall spirit, she felt so right to be in that captains chair! I loved her every decision and how she never measured as weak. On several occasions she gave orders and those below her could not or would not comply (usually an ethical wall) and she had the balls to do it herself.. essentially saying to those under her ""i wouldn't ask you to do something i wouldn't be willing to do myself"". I actually have to say so far she is actually my favorite captain. 

So, Captain Jonathan Archer. His personality is that of a man who is ready to take off the training wheels from earth. A new Era for mankind, with a Captain true at heart at the command, ready to make great leaps with his hand held outward to all. He really has a knack for bringing out the strength in others. 

Archer might not stand out like the others but from the view of time earth just really getting out of their solar neighborhood.. you couldn't really expect a hardcore Captain like the others..

All this being said, what makes Enterprise so ""bad""? I constantly hear its the worst and it's proven by having been canceled in season 4.

17,Anyone Else Have a Love-Hate relationship with the DS9 Finale?,1600324932,"Binge watching DS9 for the second time. But one thing I cannot bring myself to do is watch the series finale again. I have this weird-love hate relationship with it.

I'm happy that O'Brien didnt have to suffer anymore. His story was complete. He had a great family and now he could go enjoy life with them on earth and not be tortured anymore or constantly be told to do 10 hours worth of work in 2. But I wish they would have made him a Master Chief Petty Officer though in his farewell scene. His badassery would have been complete. 

The final showdown with Dukat I think was great. Operatic in its climax. Dukat got the sendoff he deserved as so did the Kai (with a residue of redemption at the last possible second). But Sisko dying but not really dying. It just made me feel like he was forever away from his family and friends. Like some lonely ghost. I'd rather he would be given the chance to do that monologue he had to Jake rather than Cassidy. 

Glad Garak got to go home. He probably schemed up something on the shuttle trip to cardassia that had nothing to do with hemming. 

Quark still where he started on day one. What's a Ferengi got to do to get a small little moon or something? 

Worf becoming a diplomat? I didnt buy that. I felt like they BS'ed that in 5 seconds. I'd have rather he decided to help Alexander or build a batleth studio next to his parents house or something. 

Poor Kira. That last shot of her and Jake alone. It felt so lonely. He didnt get to say goodbye to his father and her sort of boyfriend went back to the genocidal founders instead of growing and becoming truly comfortable with the solids (that's the way I see it). Now she's in charge of the station with most of her friends gone and no obvious romantic partner in sight.

Julian too. I had a hard time believing he would somehow make things click with the less than confident Ezri after letting Jadzia slip through his fingers. It just felt like he lost his best friend and was now kind of alone on the station. 

But dont get me wrong. These aren't really BAD endings. Most are perfectly realistic given the show's context. And it would be silly to assume they'd all pal around for life never getting promoted or transfered like Harry Kim. But the endings just feel quite sad for the most part. That's why I have a love-hate relationship with it. It's like watching your college clique break up on the last day of school. Not bad.

Voyager: Man, there were some really really bad episodes but there were also some really good ones. I loved Janeway, Tuvok, Neelix (thought he was good, then annoying, then once he stopped creeping on Kes I started liking him again), Paris, Kim. 

DS9: I thought Sisko was OK but I was never really blown away by him except for ""In The Pale Moonlight"" which might be my favorite episode of all Trek. The ancillary characters were by far the best. Quark, Garak, Odo, Dax, Kira, and my bros O'Brien and Worf too. I'm sure I'm forgetting something. Weyoun also was amazing, and I was so happy to see him again in Enterprise. He makes for such a perfect bad guy, I want to cheer for him and hate him at the same time. Again, there were some pretty bad episodes, especially the mirror universe stuff which makes no sense to me and I don't like seeing people being pointlessly cruel.

Enterprise: It took me a few episodes to get in. I didn't like Archer at first, but he grew on me after a few episodes. Overall I thought this show was the most consistent. There were only a few really bad ones, and only a few really good ones, but I was never bored. The ending was weird, but I wish they had made more seasons.

But stuff like Archer breathing down people necks when he asks for people's reports, or how he always looks confused, and an absolutely amazing pose that Reed did once when he shot a phase pistol... \*chef's kiss\*.  It's like the modern day version of the campy quality that TOS had.

I just watched two really strange episodes though, and they were back to back.  I know the episode names for enterprise don't give much description, so I will call the episodes ""Vulcan Zombies"" and ""The Incel at the End of the Universe"".  What is going on?  Hahaha...  I understand how they each advance the plot but there is so much extra going on that feels so out of place.

70,"That whole DS9 and Israel thing, redux?",1600243520,"I found a whole lot of threads about this when I searched, but I couldn't find any un-archived ones so I wanted to bring up a subject that's been eating at my mind for years.  


I watched DS9 as a kid and it wasn't until a friend in college was watching it for the first time that the parallels to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict were brought to my attention. His mention of it was vague enough that I didn't know what exactly he was referring to, and it came to mind that there are actually at least two different parallels.  


First, the Cardassian occupation of Bajor is a rather broad allegory for many different oppressive occupations that have occurred in human history. The British occupation of India, many other instances of European colonialism and of course arguably also the situation faced by the Palestinians.  


But there's another arguable parallel that is perhaps less obvious unless you are familiar with certain criticisms of Israel: The changelings.

The changelings are a people who have been oppressed and persecuted in nearly every instance where they've tried to live among solids. They eventually came to the misguided conclusion that the only way to secure safety for their own race was to control everyone else. They rarely exert their control directly, but instead via intermediaries (the Jem Hadar and Vorta). They have a sense that it is right that they rule over all of the other races. I want to make it clear I don't believe in any of the parallel assertions about Jewish people or even necessarily Israeli, but I can't help but see the parallels to common anti-Israel (and indeed anti-semitic) talking points.  


Backing off from the specific parallels, I think that the Bajorans and Changelings represent two sides of the experience of an oppressed people.  


I think the parallels people draw with Bajorans in term of tradition and religion may be a bit of a stretch, and I think the fact that they were *only* oppressed by the Cardassians (as far as we know) makes their link with Jewish people--who have been oppressed and persecuted repeatedly by many different cultures--a bit imperfect. But the Bajorans represent a people who escape oppression and ultimately avoid falling to the same tendencies.  


I think the Changelings represent the danger. They show what can happen when an oppressed people fail to learn the right lesson from their oppression, resulting in a continuation of the cycle. They were persecuted for being different, and in turn they persecute those different from them. They were distrusted by all, and in turn they refuse to trust anyone.  


So no I don't think that the Changelings were intended to represent Jews or the Israeli state as they actually exist today. But I think that they possibly represent what *could* happen if things get out of hand. And, by that same token, that allegory can be applied to many other people as well.

78,Why does no one ever mention the awesome destructive power of Warp speed technology?,1600224644,"If you took an object with a mass of 1,500 metric tons, for example a fully fueled NASA space shuttle, accelerated it to 30% the speed of light and aimed it at an M-class planet, the force of the explosion it would create when hitting said planet would be equivalent to 1.5 million megatons of TNT.

How much is 1.5 million megatons? Imagine every single nuclear weapon that is currently on Earth exploding at the same time - then multiply that by 150.

This one space shuttle, at just 30% *c* would be enough to completely annihilate Earth's ecosystem in a single blow. 

Let's say we up the speed a little. At ""only"" 86.6% light-speed the amount of kinetic energy is equal to the rest mass, which means that our hypothetical space shuttle would inflict upon the target the same energy as if it was composed of pure antimatter. 1,500 metric tons of antimatter.

Now imagine it was traveling *literally a thousand times faster.*

What I'm getting at here, is that any Warp-capable vessel in the Star Trek universe could be very easily turned into a weapon of mass destruction capable of wiping out an entire solar system. Don't know how to stop the Borg cube? Shoot a shuttle at it at Warp 6 and watch the entire cube get liquefied at the molecular level. Trouble with the Dominion? Turn their homeworld into a new asteroid belt with a single attack. After all, a Galaxy Class ship weighs 5 million tons, so at just 86.6% *c* that would be like 5 million tons of pure antimatter.

I know, of course, that including this as an actual plot point would more or less torpedo the entire premise of Star Trek. I just wish they would at least acknowledge it in some way.

4,"Of all Star Trek technologies, The Universal Translator has the least basis in reality and science.",1600198591,"The universal translator combined with a few sentences never before heard, and voila, you've deciphered a new language with no common roots other than (sometimes) 4 billion year old DNA.

And if DNA played a major role, it isn't shown in ST or IRL. I mean we can't decipher languages made by the same species (humans), just thousands of years ago but we could decipher those of people we've never heard of. And coming into life on different planets would make it almost impossible to find a common feature to base on (for classical translation).

So how can the Universal Translator decipher new languages? As far as I can tell there are 2 possible methods listed below-

&amp;#x200B;

**The (Im)Possible methods of \[Initial\] Translation-**

&amp;#x200B;

* Option 1, Classical: 

That is translation by deduction &amp; logic. Now the most you can get during first contact is a few sentences. And maybe you can translate them if the first few words are almost always the same across species. But the most you can get from the sentences is child-level grammar structure. And that too is a miracle in most cases. Even if the UT somehow translated the the first few sentence, there is no way it can know the meaning of new words without no prior knowledge. So the only way it can translate more (unheard) words is by listening to broadcasts (and hoping they've similar communiques to us) as it's practically impossible to predict how a culture will develop/developed in 10 years, let alone 1,000 years (to sufficiently translate the entire language) from a few words, and how the people look. But in the case of ENT, the language was translated within minutes of first view, which is virtually impossible. The more likely thing to happen would be what the Kreetarians did- taking our language's database and running some algorithm to translate it.

&amp;#x200B;

* Option 2, Mind-Reading :

 Makes a little more sense as mind-reading is possible via artificial constructs (PIC). Note that I said mind-reading as Mind-melds only allow you to see memories &amp; their associated memories (as far as it is shown) whereas true telepathy could allow you to see their thoughts.

 Now, How do we remember the meaning of basic words? We won't remember paraphrased definitions as they would require us to remember more words. More likely than not, we would've connected them to memories. Which means UTs have to understand a memory. For now, let's say they understood them somehow. But this still won't make sense. Ferengis, due to their unusual brain structure, can't be read by telepaths (at least Betazoids), but somehow 24th century UT could translate their language (In ENT, the Ferengi translated English using their UTs, not Starfleet's, so there would be little record). And with Tamarians (Children of Tama), the UT supposedly can't translate anymore than the base words. But if the UT is telepathic it would/will have understood the meaning behind phrases (as the UT translating you saying 'Go break a leg' literally into, for example, Klingon will end up with your broken legs). And of course, ignoring privacy too could create major problems.

Some have said it interprets brain waves. But almost no species can share similar/same neuro-receptors, neuro-chemicals. And some species even have completely different brain structures. And some, completely different biology. So finding commonality b/w their brain patterns would be a herculean task.

&amp;#x200B;

Which means neither option works (and as far as I could find, there were no other methods)

&amp;#x200B;

**The Aesthetic mistakes (Maybe excusable as the show would've become irritating)**

* The almost infinite processing speed required for translating the words as soon as they're said. There are some experimental live chat translators IRL, but i) they've the usual lag of &amp; wait until their is pause while talking. So it would make sense if there was some lag.
* And even if the above could be done, there exists the fact that every next word said (&amp; how it's said) changes the meaning of the whole sentence in some languages (including English), requiring the UT to predict/ know the future.
* The native language being cancelled out. This could make sense if everyone used ferengi based UTs, but many won't agree to sub-dermal implants. Also many species won't take kindly to their voices being overwritten. 

The only 'episode' that actually obeys these rules was 'the brightest star', where Lt. Georgiuo words are translated slower &amp; aren't cancelled out by the Kelpian's language when speaking to Saru. 

&amp;#x200B;

And I get that it is supposed a plot device, but so is a warp drive, phaser or a transporter. Granted they need some assumptions (Subspace, Nadions, Perfect M-E conversion), but at least they're built on top of that. Add to that they have reasonable real world replicas / theories (See this) But as far as I can see, there is no reasonable assumption for the UT to work as it does in ST, nor is there one in real life.",startrek,DarthMaw23,False,/r/startrek/comments/itfx9e/of_all_star_trek_technologies_the_universal/
5,"Most Star Trek Technologies are no longer a possible solution to a problem, but are results of developments.",1600198585,"These include theories as well, for some technologies are scientifically sound but don't have the required resources.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Transporters-** A transporter with ME-conversion can exist but would be way bulkier than shown (and would also require a receiver). But a much simpler transporter could be a ''duplicator &amp; disintegrator'' (a duplicate item is sent down, and the original is destroyed), but this can only 'transport' things that are near stationary at the atomic level (Hello, Uncertainty Principle), and therefore no living things (But ST managed somehow violate it using 'Heisenberg Compensator, so...'). Or maybe we would've found a method to control &amp; induce quantum tunneling.
* **Warp Drive-** Something similar to Alcubierre Drive as well as spacetime bubbles (way too complicated to explain here, check this [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcubierre_drive)) can be used instead of a warp drive.
* **Replicators-** A replicator can be similar to a transport or may use a deposit of a single element/ compound  which can be changed into any thing using nuclear transmutation (or fusion) and simple 3-d printing.
* **Phasers-** Handheld Phasers and Ship Phasers are similar enough to LASERs (Stun could either be a particle weapon or some variation of wireless electricity). Or maybe you went crazy and decided to use focused Plasma, which could still do all that Phasers can (And maybe stun could be sensor overload caused by plasma discharge or a voltage differential or wireless electricity).
* **Photon Torpedos-** Photon Torpedoes are just M-AM reaction missiles.
* **Impulse drive** An Impulse drive is a combination of Fusion propulsion (By heating plasma, like how water is heated through fission, and then releasing it for thrust) and subspace sublight propulsion (A similar thing can be done to spacetime using the Alcubierre drive). Possible without warp engines.
* **Cloaking Device-** A cloaking device IRL could be either cameras and projectors or a radiation absorber (which can only be found by searching for stars missing).
* **Artificial Gravity-** Artificial gravity is probably generated using (theoretical) artificial gravitons. Or by us via rotation. 
* **Tractor Beams-** Tractor beams can use gravitational fields (via gravitons) or EM fields (if the target ship is Paramagnetic).
* **Comms/Tricorders-** You've got something in your pocket millions of times faster &amp; versatile than Communicators &amp; Tricorders. And a variation of that, and you've all the sensors needed.
* **Force Fields-** We can use plasma controlled through EM fields to make 'force fields', but these will be relatively weak and would be more helpful as a emergency bulkhead. And your hand may be burnt depending on how concentrated the plasma is. You could be temporarily blinded,too...
* **Shields (Deflectors)-** Deflectors arrays/ Shields use Force fields, but until we can make the Plasma Variant stronger or discover new particles (such as Nadions in ST), they wouldn't be useful. But again stronger EM fields via superconducting magnets may be enough to stop ST weapons. Such a field may be enough to break Antimatter containment in photon torpedoes (as containment is magnetic in nature / is a penning trap), effectively self-destructing the missile. It could also divert Plasma from IRL phasers (no idea about Nadions' magnetism, though) around the field (thus the ship too). LASERs will be way more complicated, as they can be affected by EM fields (but not by much), but Plasma Force field could dissipate it. No idea about Transporter blocking due to unconfirmed methods of Transportation transmission.
* **Holodecks-** We have the display / image part figured out (at least microscopically) but for tactile purposes a haptic (tactile) glove is more likely than ''re-sequenced'' photons. Or maybe we manage to accurately control atoms using EM fields, and can create a sort of skin for the hologram.
* **Bio-Neural Circuitry-** See [Synthetic Biological Circuitry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_biological_circuit) and [Artificial Neural Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network#Theoretical_properties). They aren't faster than traditional circuitry per se, but can make not so obvious connection (like us) instead of brute-forcing, work as much better sensor, etc. So a mixed bag.
* **Dermal Regenerators-**  This can be done by either grafting cloned skin / artificial replacements (which could be dissolvable stitches), or by speeding up their natural regeneration via chemicals that play a part in healing.
* **Hypospray-** A jet injector (from which the term 'hypospray' originated) is technically a needle-less injection but we've yet to come across truly painless &amp; no risk hypospray (though many are in development).
* **Universal Translators-**  This is the only thing I can't sufficiently define IRL, other than for already translated langues. Will be explained more in this post.",startrek,DarthMaw23,False,/r/startrek/comments/itfx6h/most_star_trek_technologies_are_no_longer_a/

22,Why I've come to love Star Trek V: The Final Frontier,1600173773,"For a long time I shared in the mutual dislike for STV. It's cheesy in parts, cannon breaking scenes for the sake of a cheap laugh (rocket boosting up the lift shaft past deck 78), a backwards step in special effects, etc.  


But I re-framed the film in my mind and learned to fall in love with it. Here are just a few of my reasons:  


* I view it as a buddy film, the settings and drama are secondary. We know the history of the main characters and we're at a point where we're watching long matured friendships (even if there's a military-esk hierarchical nature to why they're together in the first place). So much is about the nature of their friendships, it gives us insight into where they are in later middle age, where what they're left with are a few core friends, which is what most people are left with from their earlier years.   
The film ends where it starts. With a core set of good friends who have just been through another profound life changing event. They settle down, knowing all the baggage each person's build up over their lives, and feeling the safety of solid ground with people that understand each other the most.
* Kirk's journey into introspection about himself and his own relationship with himself. There was some quirky nonsense about him falling off a cliff, but the deeper part of that was Kirk exploring his relationship with himself, looking to rekindle the feeling of risk and meaning to his life, and realising he's not that young invincible captain any more. He's wondering about his own nature and of those around him. His comments at the end of the film about knowing he'll die alone are a sort of a conclusion to that part of his personal journey in the film. It also adds to the often equally disliked death of Kirk. He did die alone, completely removed from his loved ones and friends who have long since gone (except maybe Scotty who's probably still limping around in a shuttle somewhere getting up to all sorts). He died on an unfamiliar planet, with just one unfamiliar person nearby and no one else even knew he was alive at that point.
* It's shows us the winter years of a crew's career. They get into another scrape but age has started to overcome experience. The ship's not ready, the crew's not ready but the universe will not stop coming at them. They're getting too old for this, and they're realising that. They handed over the reigns to the next generation in the next film quite dramatically, but they were pulled out of retirement for that. What we're seeing here is the years before retirement. It may be about the time the older senior officers realise it's not their game any more. 
* I enjoy their exploration of faith, and how that can be manipulated to make good people do terrible things. Sybok wasn't a bad man, he was just misguided. Possibly manipulated from afar by the creature imprisoned on the planet who reached out and found a weak mind. Sybok in turn used common ground in other faiths and brain washing techniques to bring people into a cult. A very bad path from someone who's intention seemed to be genuine and believed by him to be good.

Because they are in command of that department. Basically everyone in the senior briefings should wear red.

It also doesn't make sense to have a red uniform to show you're in the command branch, because what are you commanding? 4 pips would make sense, you're a captain. But let's say you're in command of engineering, then 2 colors should be used; red and yellow. The pips are hard to see. People that are new on a ship must then shout ""who's in command of engineering?!"". To know who's the boss over there.

It's almost as if the red uniform is distributed randomly. E.g the helmsman wears red. But why? It's an operations task, just like firing phasers and polish the warp core.

The red uniform would only make sense if only the first officer, captain and the head of the branches on the ship wear red, with an extra color around the collar of their neck to signify which branch they are in command of. Of which the captain and first officer just have a black collar.

Admiral Janeway stole a special shuttle and a prototype device to go back in time and make the Voyager journey significantly shorter. Other Starfleet officers try to stop her referring to the Temporal Prime Directive, a law/rule so people cant just change the timeline as they want. 

Janeway dont just give them a faster way to home, but very advanced and dangerous future anti-borg technology. Just from a few hours of modifications Voyager become so much powerful that can go against three borg cube, play a tug of war with them and blow up two of them with easy.

The stranded Voyager crew without help or much of a resources was capable to integrate the ablabtive armors, what can withstand a multiple borg cube attacks with low difficulty. Their future transphasic torpedoes can destroy an entire borg cube with one hit.  And these significant advancements are still on Voyager when they arrive home.

Just imagine what would happen when the Klingon Empire or the Romulan StarEmpire learns about these horribly powerful and destrictive weapons the Federation have. It can caus distrust and outrage between the races and would become problematic and start political affairs with them.

First, I'll admit that I'm not up on all the stuff that goes on outside of the movies and TV shows, so it's entirely possible that this subject has been covered in an interview with a producer, or a comic book, or novel, or some other source.  Also, this may have been already talked about here and I didn't notice because I wasn't caught up with Discovery and didn't join the subreddit until after I had watched season 2 to protect myself from spoilers.  So I am sorry if this has topic has already been discussed and put to bed.

[Topic starts here]

Like it or not, Star Trek V: The Final Frontier is canon (again, unless something happened outside of the TV shows that I haven't seen) and therefore, so is the existence of Sybok.

So why did Discovery never mention the existence of Spock's full-blooded Vulcan half-brother?

It's obvious from the flashbacks in Discovery that the focus was on the relationship between Michael and Spock and that they were close, at least up until she tries to run away, and while Spock mentions that he and Sybok were raised together after his mother's death he doesn't mention how old they were when this happens, but I don't think it's unreasonable to assume that these two time periods overlapped.

So, I have to ask; did the producers, writers, etc not do enough research? Did they choose to omit Sybok because of some kind of constraint, either time or money?

Indeed, there is nothing explicitly preventing the idea that humans aware of intelligent life anywhere else in the galaxy; First Contact was the first *interaction* with aliens, not necessarily the first *knowledge*. So if today's news pans out the way most of us hope it does, it should not create a ""continuity breach"" with the Trek universe.

The more important reference was in ""Past Tense"" when the timeline changes and O'Brien tries to find Starfleet signatures, and mentions he can't find the ""terraforming stations on Venus.""

So in the Trek future, we are terraforming Venus. Would we do so if there were life there? Do the needs of humans outweigh the needs of microbes? Are they somehow terraforming ""around"" the life in a way that it survives the process? Is the Prime Directive involved in any form?

She has a general understanding of Trek, what Starfleet is, and the basic character traits of the players on the bridge.  She doesn't, however, have backstory on characters or know their interpersonal relationships yet.

I have been very successful in cherry-picking episodes, giving a one or two sentence back-story -- almost like you'd watch an episode of Black Mirror.  


I started with Inner Light.  All I had to tell her to be ready was that ""Picard isn't a family man.  He's kinda married to the job.""  


Then we watched Measure of a Man.  I had to tell her that Data and Yar had a relationship and that she'd since died.  


Next was Tapestry.  I had to tell her that Q is a God-like alien that comes and goes that likes to troll Picard and that Picard had an artificial heart.  


So, what's next?  


I like the episodes with moral dilemmas.  I was thinking ""Half a Life"" might be good.  Or maybe one of the good two-parters like Unification or Chain of Command, but I'm not sure if too much backstory on the various races is required.

Don't get me wrong, I like Beyond, but I understand why the general audience didn't warm up to it.

Beyond didn't outright flop, but it also didn't make the kind of money they hoped. The general audience was uninspired about the scenes from the trailer, motor cycle chases, explosions, martial arts fight scenes.  You can get all this in Marvel movies, so why go see the same stuff again?

I think the key to a successful Star Trek film, and I could be wrong, but I think the way to make a Star Trek film to really stand out from the pack is to make a story only Star Trek could tell. It has to be a novel concept that really doesn't work in other genres, or would be too out of left field. You can't make a Star Trek that is just heist in space, or revenge in space, or action movie in space.

It can have those elements of course, but it needs to be something truly unique and attention grabbing to make an audience go ""Huh, that looks wild, I gotta see that.""

Riker remains extremely optimistic throughout the entire episode, understanding the value of learning the ways of a new culture even though many think he is crazy.

24,My thoughts on Voyager season 1 after watching TNG and DS9 (Spoilers for DS9 and VOY S1),1600022547,"I know this isn’t exactly a regular content post, but I wondered if people felt the same way that I did. About eleven years ago I watched Star Trek 2009 with my father, he was a big fan of the original series, watching it on a tiny television on a San Francisco naval base during his training before deployment to Vietnam. I loved Star Wars but never really bothered with Trek, but I thought the 2009 movie was pretty cool so one day at a friend’s house in 2010, I grabbed my friend’s Xbox 360 controller and watched season 1 of TNG on Netflix. I thought it was alright, but I didn’t have Netflix and have never been the type to binge watch movies or TV. Then, eight years later when I began exercising to lose weight I wanted something to watch, and our new cell phone plan included Netflix. So I went to season 2 of TNG and was hooked. I ended up watching all of TNG, then this summer all of Deep Space 9.  
  
Deep Space 9 was incredible, one of the best TV shows I’ve ever watched. I really enjoyed the moment to moment episodes of TNG but the continuity and the characters of DS9 were so good I couldn’t take my eyes off it. There were some off episodes, mainly early prophet episodes and Sisko Keiko fights, Klingon episodes and the Lwaxana love sickness and the creepy space pedo who sucked Jake’s brain juices, but I enjoyed nearly all of it. The dominion war was really exciting, and the Ferengis were hilarious changes of pace. However, I’m almost glad they ended it there. They reached that point where they pair off a long running show’s main characters into romances, so they had to create Vic Fontaine solely as a single character who would resolve plot threads pertaining to all the romances. Ezri wasn’t fantastic, and the pagh wraiths were pretty lame. If they continued I think the quality would have gone way down.  
  
So, after a failed attempt to watch TOS again, I figured I’d give Voyager a try and I feel..... very mixed emotions so far. I didn’t have these outright criticisms when I watched TNG or DS9. So I think I’ll just go through the characters and tell you how I feel about them.   
  
**Kathryn Janeway** — she says she has a hard time with the separation between captain and crew, but you could’ve fooled me. She refuses to crawl out of her shell at all, and treats this voyage as an Enterprise expedition instead of a harrowing journey home from the far reaches of the galaxy. I’d like to see a more personal side of her than some boring holonovel and a game of pool.  
  
**Chakotay** — brings a little too much of that “magical Indian” vibe. I get that he’s spiritual, but the amount of supernatural powers they grant him seems a little un-Treklike. He also drops right in as the role of the commander of a Starfleet ship, which makes sense given all his time in Starfleet, but I’d like to see more of his Maquis side and less of his Janeway lapdog side.   
  
**Tom Paris** — makes no sense. For a prison convict who doesn’t feel strongly for the Maquis or the federation, he sure has managed to become everyone’s friend. He has a lot to gain by getting home, his record wiped clean and a life anew, but I find it hard to believe that someone of his past could jump in and play Starfleet without missing a beat. If anything, he should be distrustful of everyone on board, and everyone should be wary of him. But nah, he may as well be just another bright eyed Starfleet officer.  
  
**Harry Kim** — exists  
  
**Bre’lonna Torres** I think she’s— ... okay fine. Harry Kim. I get that he’s supposed to be the ensign, in over his head and given significant responsibility. But he just.. doesn’t do anything wrong. You could throw Geordi in there seamlessly. Harry needs to be able to doubt himself and make mistakes for his character to be more believable. He’s also just so flat personality wise.   
  
**Bre’lonna Torres** — I think she’s one of the better characters. Her half Klingon thing she’s got going on could be interesting, especially in a quadrant where the series can’t be speckled with Klingon Empire dramas. Faces was a really really good episode, seeing both sides of her genetics was fascinating. But apart from the second episode and that, she’s been little more than the treknobabble engineer. I want more of her for season 2.   
  
**Kess** — yawn. She’s nothing but a mannequin for the doctor and Neelix to converse at. Not sold on her relationship with Neelix either. I’m sure the only reason she’s training as a nurse is to make neato episodes where something goes wrong with the doctor. Her telepathy stuff is Diet Troi. Pass.  
edit: I'm watching season 2 and she just ate a handful of bugs. That was genuinely hilarious. Maybe hope for her yet?  
  
**Emergency Medical Hologram** — interesting guy. I’m glad they gave him feelings and allow him to explore his rights and sentience. The Viking episode let him shine and that was a joy to watch. He notices who treats him as a hologram and who treats him as a person and acts accordingly and I enjoy that dynamic.   
  
**Neelix** — easily the best character on the show by far. The only character that really makes me happy when he’s on screen. The show needed a native and a guide for the Delta Quadrant, and he fits into that role perfectly. They need someone who can clash with the ship’s personnel, since they’re so bad at highlighting the Starfleet-Maquis split in any meaningful way. His love for cooking and desire to get along with everyone pushes Janeway and the others into being interesting, even if only for a little while. The episode with the evil doctor was by far the best of season 1. Neelix is full of life and emotion, basically the only character who fits that bill so far. I want to see a lot more of him, if they’re not going to resuscitate any of the bridge crew.  
  
**Tuvok** — oh yeah, I forgot about him. That last Neelix sentence reminded me he exists. What made Spock so cool was his relationship with Kirk, his banter with McCoy, and the things he’d do to protect his friends. Take all that away and you get Tuvok. He’s just Logic McLogicson. I will do this thing because it is logical, and only break the rules and following the rules is illogical. Its cool we’re seeing neck pinches and mind melds, but this guy is completely half baked.  
  
So there you have it I think. I haven’t felt this.. ambivalent about a Star Trek cast before. So many of them are just flat and dull, and the episodes feel more like TNG2 than a show about getting home from the unknown, and not in a good way. I’m really hoping the characters get better later, the plots are pretty interesting but the characters need a ton of work outside of Neelix. I’m curious how other TNG and DS9 fans feel about Voyager, but **please don’t talk about later seasons.** Thanks for reading!",startrek,lmhTimberwolves,False,/r/startrek/comments/is3ys4/my_thoughts_on_voyager_season_1_after_watching/
25,So I’ve often thought what a Borg War might look like......,1600020953,"I’ve often thought that an idea of the Alpha Quadrant (not just the Federation) could end up having a long drawn out war with the Borg. Something has legs (multiple series) and sees the conflict from both sides and not be based on a single starship or cube (at least all of the time). If set in the timeline properly would allow the on screen introduction of a new Enterprise F/G. Would also allow for greater exploration of the Romulan/Federation relationship seen in Picard and would mean that all of the modern cinematic technology available could be brought to bear on epic scale on-screen battles between fleets in space.

33,What it’s like watching Star Trek: The Motion Picture for the first time in 2020,1600012571,"I realise this is the second day in a row I’ve posted something praising the TOS era of Star Trek, but watching it for the first time it deserves to be spoken about (who doesn’t love discussing Trek) and because apparently not a lot of people like it.

After watching TOS for the first time recently I was blown away by how much I loved it, especially the way the show was able to create a universe as iconic as Star Trek with such a small budget. What made me most excited for MP was the thought of seeing this universe get the budget it deserved, however I was also nervous. I’d heard that the movie had received bad reviews from critics and fans with a 41% rating and was worried that this transition to the big screen might get rid of what made Star Trek what it is, it’s safe to say the critics were wrong. 

Straight away the movie blows you away with the Klingon attack against v’ger with some amazing special effects, especially the ship models. What surprised me the most was that this new iconic design was in the movie for around 2 minutes, however I’m guessing there will be more of them to come. Later on we are also treated to a beautiful sequence as Kirk and Scotty take a shuttle craft to board the Enterprise, as the filmmakers show off the amazing new model. However, the most impressive effect in the film has to be V’ger itself. An impressive mix of matte paintings and practical effects creates a mysterious alien that looks like nothing seen in the Star Trek universe up to now. Unlike TOS the motion picture is more accessible to a modern viewer like myself. The cheap 60s look is gone (for better or worse) and now the universe is more consistent to what modern sci-fi films look like. With a new Enterprise also comes new uniforms. I loved the 60s look of the original uniforms, with their bright colours that always stand out, but I can understand why they made the change. At first I despised the beige colour scheme that everything had, it wasn’t until the movie ended that I began to like the new designs and appreciate how the universe itself has advanced since we last saw it in TOS.

With this change in design as the film moves away from campy 60s cheapness, the tone of the story also changes. The most disturbing part of the movie has to be when the Enterprise transporter fails and we watch two crewman scream as their atoms merge together. This serious tone allows the actors to deliver great performances. Here Shatner plays a Kirk who is somewhat out of his league in this new Enterprise, instead of the campy starship captain who has been taken over by a woman. All the returning cast members do a great job in the roles, with the highlights once again being Kirk, Spock and Bones. However I was disappointed that Sulu, Uhura, Chekhov and Scotty had minimal roles apart from the occasional line and sitting in the bridge. The new characters introduced also add a depth that the show never had, with Deckers relationship to Ilia providing emotional moments the show rarely had. 

The story itself also felt very Star Trek, which isn’t surprising since it was originally the pilot for a cancelled ‘Star Trek Phase 2’. I found the mystery surrounding V’ger interesting and the revelation of it being a Voyager probe a great concept that made for a perfect ending. Many people complained about the film feeling like a normal episode of TOS but with a bigger budget, for me that wasn’t a bad thing. It was exactly what I wanted out of a Star Trek movie as a fan of TOS and managed to capture what made the show great, many people wanted an action film but that isn’t what the show was about. It was instead a slow burning beautiful sci-fi film that kept you engaged with an amazing mystery and universe.

54,"Part of what made TNG era trek so compelling and ""bigger"" was the fact it started in media res",1599991798,"With the newer star trek series, with the tendency towards one fixed story arc across an entire season, it has the odd effect of making the entire trek universe somehow smaller - and I think that might be the abandonment of using in medias res as a storytelling technique - with TNG and VOY and to a lesser extent DS9 and ENT, the story would begin with the story title and a necessary log entry to bring the viewer up to speed - in other words you had the sense of the story having begun well before and it was as if the viewer had suddenly materialised and had to be given the background story very quickly - the effect was to create a sense of a huge living universe that continues to run if the viewer is watching or not, and continues evolving and changing when the audience went away - and in line with the comfort of TNG made you feel like you were part of the crew, with this story being only a small part of a bigger universe of stories.

As a technique it's very effective, and has been used for centuries - Shakespeare even makes oblique references to events and people happening offstage that don't serve the story at all but act to make the story seem to have connections and sub plots beyond the ones seen on stage. 

Now, does that mean it's perfect? Not at all - as has been pointed out, if you have to wrap each episode ina neat bow, it limits storytelling opportunities for wider arcs, especially in voyager, that could have benefited from larger exploration over an arc - but I think, as DS9 infamously showed, and Battlestar Galactica reboot, that sci-fi benefits from not being one or the other - having a story arc that keeps a wider plot going is great, but with allowance for subplots and diversions within - the model of more classic naval adventures in which you have the super objective (to get home, to deliver a message, to save something, to explore strange new worlds) with inevitable weekly distractions and, crucially, andis offering the more mundane aspects of running a ship for multi years missions.

Discovery is terrible at this and the result is the whole story arc feels like just one long episode but it has the odd effect of making the story seem smaller, with everything in the universe happening in relation to this one vessel. It would benefit to have a sense of things they are doing when the audience is not watching. It's what gives the characters a strange need to give speeches, rather than just be ""themselves"" and allow us to be a fly on the wall. 
 This may exactly be the thrust of what they are attempting to recapture with the ""side"" series of short treks, lower decks, and strange new worlds. Here's hoping!

As Tilly is infected by the spore they seem to treat it as an alien invasion to her body and first Stamets idea is to suck it out of her and then they act like its a super hostile force so they make a forcefield around it etc. Also the spore is acting very dramatic.

The spore being dramatic is ok since it is trying to communicate to Tilly something is destroying its world. It is asking for help. And Discovery response? It is a dangerous thing they treat aggressively before even properly investigating. Despite the fact it is THE goal of starfleet to seek new forms of life. This is even a form they sort of know and stamets should love to talk to.

Yes, they communicate and help the spore at the end, but first we need to get that non starfleet drama aproach. And thats where other trek shows I feel would go differently about it. Especially when its a form of life that communicates and asks for help.

* The use of the holodeck as like a giant 'nutshell study' (a crime scene recreated as a dollhouse for further examination after the original scene is cleaned) is a genius idea (""A Matter of Perspective"").
* I'm beginning to think that a season without Q is an incomplete one, as so far he's been in at least one per season; this one was spectacular and rather redeeming (""Deja Q""). He's still annoying though!
* ""Sarek"" hit particularly close to home, with the whole 'mental degeneration with old age / losing your self to incurable illness' thing being one of the things I especially fear.
* I have a feeling I would probably end up in the same situation as Lt. Barclay and spend too much time in a holodeck simulation where everything goes my way and end up late for real life things (""Hollow Pursuits"").
* It was fun seeing Tasha Yar again, even if for one episode (""Yesterday's Enterprise"").
* From everything I've read on various sites, ""The Hunter"" isn't too far from how  war veterans (American at least) are treated IRL - expected to be able to just turn off their training and PTSD and become normal, 'productive' citizens without needing support upon discharge.
* Despite knowing that everything turns out ok - because I have the rest of the series on my computer - the cliff hanger at the end of ""The Best of Both Worlds pt1"" is still tense!

5,What it’s like watching TOS for the first time in 2020,1599905713,"I consider myself to be a diehard sci-fi fan, anything set in a galaxy far away or in the not so distant future I loved, so when I told people I’ve never seen Star Trek they always got confused. It’s not that I wasn’t interested, it just seemed like a big task that I didn’t have time to do. With 9 shows and 12 movies I never knew where to start, or where I would get the time to watch it all. I wish I had started sooner. With Star Trek being the cultural icon it is, I already had some idea what to expect, most of which were wrong. Kirk was a rash captain who would sleep with almost everything, Spock never showed emotion and would tell everyone to “live long and prosper” and that whenever the away party wanted to return to the Enterprise they would say “beam me up Scotty!” I also heard that the show looked cheap and fake, causing you to not be able to properly invest yourself in what was happening, which after watching the show I can confirm is 100% wrong.

The first thing that blew me away was the sense of scale the show was conveying. As a modern viewer I was used to shows like Game of Thrones or Westworld that had millions of dollars spent on every episode to make their world feel real, what amazes me is that TOS manages to do that with a tiny amount of those shows budgets. The enterprise bridge feels real, with every button having a practical use. Each planet feels like a strange alien world, just through the use of some alien ruin prop and fog to cover up the background. Each race feels unique and memorable, not because of fancy special effects, but because you can tell they poured their souls into crafting a sci-fi universe out of whatever they could find in the studio lot. I think what helped my enjoyment of the show was understanding the context of how it was made. I knew that this was 1960s TV and my expectations were set for that, if you made someone who has never heard of Star Trek they would probably think it was a terrible cheap looking joke. 

The main thing that really elevates TOS to the masterful show it is, are the characters. As mentioned before I had the wrong idea about some of the characters (due to the JJ Abrams movies) so was surprised by how good they were in this show. Kirk is a level headed captain, how can outsmart his enemies, charm anyone if needed and can hold his own in a fight. Shatner also manages to carry most episodes, he knows when to act seriously and when to go all out screaming to the sky. McCoy is probably my favourite character, who always gets the funniest lines with his interaction with Spock. However it was Leonard Nimoy who really blew me away. Spock isn’t just a one note character who has no emotion, being half human Spock has struggled his whole life to control his emotions, and Nimoy delivers that struggle perfectly throughout.

Finally the overall quality and variation of the episodes and world building was superb. One week you are watching a pure 60s episode of TV as an evil Kirk roams the enterprise in pure campiness. The next week it’s a nail biting edge of your seat episode as the Enterprise battles a Bird of Prey in submarine warfare, or a comedy episode about tribbles, a love story about two people separated by time. Star Treks diversity of episodes keeps it feeling fresh and allows a modern viewer to go through the show and be able to watch what they want without missing an overarching story. Throughout the show you also get slowly introduced to a larger universe, from Starfleet to WW3 and the Romulan war, it makes this universe feel alive and encourages you to watch more, to find out about its history and discover strange new worlds with the cast. 

If you’ve actually read this to the end then I’d love to hear what your favourite episodes are, for now though, I get to watch the motion picture.",startrek,ben111567,False,/r/startrek/comments/ira367/what_its_like_watching_tos_for_the_first_time_in/

Tilly: basically the exact same comments as above.

Prime/Mirror Georgiou: most of the response to these characters I have seen is positive. I have seen a few negative reactions, but in general this character seems to be very well received.

Pike: this character seems to have gotten overwhelmingly positive response. While I'm not claiming there aren't any people that didn't like him, I don't recall seeing any real negative reaction myself.

Saru: very similar to above. I have pretty much only seen positive response to this character and don't recall seeing any real negative response.

Read the synopsis if you need to. This episode, which was amazing because of Tony fuckin Todd's performance, is about Jake's life, after an unexpected event causes his father to ""die"". Ben later returns and tells Jake not to worry about him and go on with his life, but in the end, Jake is unable to get over his father's loss, and spends the rest of his life waiting for him to return to our plane of reality. Life went on without his father around, he had family to take care of, friends to take care of him, but he never really recovers, and most of his life is spent worrying about his father.

With very little variation, Ben having ""died"" and then returning long enough to pass along a message to Kasidy mirrors the events of The Visitor. Ben says his goodbyes, and Kasidy relays the messages to Jake.   


The biggest variation is that in one situation, Ben gets lost to Jake in an accident, whereas in the other, Ben gets lost to Jake as a result of the Prophets taking him away, but the end result is mostly the same. Ben may return some day, but Jake suddenly lost the person he was closest to in the world.

Seriously, that long hair phase? Fucksake man, leave any man or woman for anyone else please. He’s a great actor, don’t want to belittle the talent he’s honed, but still, Jesus. 

Still, with a lot of disputes of canon and the ‘spirit’ of Trek and whatever I find his interest, involvement, upbringing and support of Trek so be such a blessing of casting. Casting directors cast the best for the role, being an advocate for the franchise is an unpredictable variable and went in all Trek fans favour in this case.

Trek fans are notoriously hard to please. I know I know, if only they respected this episode, if only they took into consideration this happened, if only they cared about the design here etc etc. I know.

What about the food and drink seen in holodeck programs.  Is it real?  Imaginary? Does it contain any actual substance?  If so, is there a cost to the holodeck?

He grows up around humans, left to feel like an outsider and outcast, the only Klingon amongst humans.

As a teenager, he accidentally kills one of his classmates in a soccer game, and has to live with that guilt.

Due to political bullshit, he has to accept his dead father being publicly discommendated and his house being stripped of its honor to try and save the Empire from the House of Duras pulling it apart.

His mate, Alexander’s mother, is killed.

He is in a constant struggle between his allegiance to his Klingon heritage and his allegiance to Star Fleet.

He loses Deanna Troi.

He loses the Enterprise-D, the one place that truly felt like home to him.

After having his family’s honor restored during the Klingon Civil War, a few years later, his family is once again stripped of its honor and titles, because he wouldn’t support Gowron’s invasion of Cardassia.

As a result of the latter, he has to watch his brother Kurt suffer, and ultimately have his memory erased so he can start fresh with a new identity.

He finally finds love with Jadzia, but then loses her too, and has to deal with the emotional Charlie Foxtrot of having Ezri around.

**Tellarite Evolution**



Before I can go into anything else I need to share the [aquatic ape hypothesis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquatic_ape_hypothesis) which is a debunked but fascinating hypothesis I'm human evolutionary thought, that humans have more adaptations for water than trees, and thus were more likely aquatic! While this is debunked, this thought crossed my mind when I was looking up facts about the Tellarites.






We already know they are exclusively herbivorous, and that their blood contains Hemerytherin which we are told is a protein found in deep sea creatures. And the more I thought about them complaining about the temperatures in ENT and these small factoids made me think it would be really fascinating if Tellarites were actually more closely related to aquatic mammals rather than apes, pigs, or the like. Something closer to whales or hippos, and the way I constructed their anatomy reflects this change.






Tellarites were very adapted to water. Their ancestors had massive upper torso fins that developed nail-like structures to uproot stubborn underwater leaves which enabled them to crawl easier on land once their food supply became scarce in certain areas. Rather than undergoing some cataclysmic event, the Tellarite ancestors are overfeeders, and likely would overeat their diet in the water until there was little left and scavenge on land until the food supply would become more depleted there as well, thus creating a consistent back/forth seasonal feeding cycle for the plants to regrow on land and sea. As time went on, they found more and more food on land, and eventually settled there.





**Tellarite Anatomy**


Tellarites are definitely one of the least attractive species and one of the easiest to not make humanoid so I jumped at the chance for it. Designing them was somewhat tricky - I obviously needed the boar face, and needed them to be intimidating, but capable of bipedality and quadripedality, and I figured the design of gorillas with pigs together would be something interesting to explore, especially if they were more closely linked to a hippo-like creature than apes.





Tellarites don't have forearm bones, they have fingers that extend through what we know as our forearms, ending in the ""nail"" or hooves. The hooves remail extendable as they were useful to scrounging at the bottom of the ocean for plant life to uproot, and while their ancestors never quite had ""fingers proper"" their arms functioned more like fins in whales. Their internal organs are nearly all located in their belly with a large chest cavity to accommodate their expanding lungs which can grow up to 4-5x their exhaled size making it useful to remain underwater for extended periods of time. Their two stomachs enable better digestion for leaves and underwater plant life, and their tails and smoother spine are vistigial remnants of necessary speed when swimming




Also pictured are the multiple nipples which are equal in both males and females, and though only the women can give birth, both may nurse. The last drawing is of a young unbearded female nursing 2 of her pups while using her extended tongue to reach tree plant life, again a useful trait to have on land when no longer in water and not the most adept at climbing. Though Tellarites have smaller brains, this has no effect on cognitive ability and they're quite adept at engineering. Though fully capable at bipedality, their walking is awkward and uncomfortable, and they prefer to walk on all fours when possible.






Lastly, their claim to fame is how incredibly rude they are. This is entirely cultural and has no basis in their biology or evolution, and became a culturally evolved trait combat overeating and scarcity of food as they began to become civilized and lived longer. Tellarites aren't the best at farming and rely on the overabundance of plant life on their planet and culturally evolved fighting and rudeness to maintain healthy and sustainable population size. Lastly, their tusks are purely a product of sexual selection and are present in both males and females, though males typically have larger tusks.

The Starfleet reinforcements come in firing and we have a war pitting the Klingons against the Federation and Cardassia.

16,Immersive Star Trek Watching - The Best Way to Watch?,1599769228,"As a star trek fan, I am always on the look out for the best experience in terms of watching trek. 

Technology has moved on in leaps and bounds in recent years. There have been star trek remasters into HD and fans have also pushed the technology envelope to create the best versions of trek even when official HD versions are not available. In particular, I am thinking of stunning efforts such as this one for DS9: 

https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/314653-remastering-deep-space-nine

I believe that this has been posted here before recently, but I have been following the author's progress for quite some time now. Indeed, previous posts by the author got me interested in some of the tools being used, for example Avisynth+ and I have started playing around with enhancing some of my own video content (wedding videos etc.). 

At this point, I would highlight that one of my other interest areas is Virtual Reality. I have an Oculus Quest VR headset which is quite an amazing device for watching VR content and 3D films (Blueray 3D derived content through the headset is jaw dropping, e.g. Star Trek into Darkness).

I have discovered through these interests that you can convert 2D content into 3D content using Avisynth+. I have posted about this before on reddit:
 https://www.reddit.com/r/OculusQuest/comments/h7q1qf/make_your_own_3d_movies_from_2d_sources_for_free/ 

So, cutting to the chase, what I have been able to do is extend the approach described for remastering DS9 in close to HD to actually create an HD 3D version as well. This is achieved quite simply by extending the Avisynth+ scripts described in the original DS9 remastering post with the 2D to 3D conversion script elements that I describe in my post. 

What you get is an immersive 3D version of trek that you can view at whatever scale you like in a VR headset (if you have one) - (or on a 3D TV - but that is a little old now I guess).

I have created a couple of proof of concept 3D SBS videos below to view. One is of the DS9 Intro sequence with the Space Station. The other is a short live action sequence from the start of Season 2 Episode 2 (first 30 seconds). Unfortunately, I am not an expert on posting videos. I have put these up on streamable - but it has reduced their horizontal resolution from 2560 pixels (SBS) to 504. If someone can suggest a better hosting location I can put them up there. You can view them in the Oculus browser (set the viewer to indicate that they are in 3D). 

I watch the originals of these in SkyBox player in 3D SBS mode - with the aspect ratio set to 4:3. The 3D effect works really well - surprisingly so. These very much reduced resolution examples are at least sufficient to show that I think. 

I can provide more information and the script that I used if people are interested. If Star Trek fans with a headset want to check these out please do - I apologise again for the reduced resolution.

I liked Discovery, I felt it kept itself moving and even if it did less exploring than I hoped for (especially for a show called...Discovery), I thought the arcs worked really well.

Then I was in the mood for some classic trek so I rewatched Enterprise...well, the last 2 seasons and the good parts of season 1-2. And it feels *bizarre* when the massive, galaxy-shattering events of the Xindi war are interrupted for an episode where we beam down to a planet for no reason and the crew is transformed into an extinct talking dinosaur species. Like what the hell guys?!

I know people really like their episodic stuff, and I probably enjoy arcs more than a lot of fans—Babylon 5 is my favorite Sci Fi show. But how discovery handled arcs felt really right. Enterprise taking a pitstop at ""kill and revive a crewmember in 1 episode"" station every 3 episodes while Earth is at stake sits really weird with me. And I feel like Discovery managed to use their B plots effectively to explore a lot of the more episodic, not-arc-friendly kind of stuff.

Also, consumption related rather than anything else, but I feel like consistent story arcs make a lot more sense for Discovery because basically no one is watching random out of context episodes, we're all watching it the whole way through.

Supporting evidence:
-Foodstuffs are inorganically materialized from transporter patterns 
-The most verbal mentions of bathrooms are on ENT and DS9, where they would logically be more common because of replicators not being used yet (ENT) or organic food being more readily available due to proximity to a planet (DS9)
-Jonathan Frankes said offhand there was only one bathroom on the D (i know there are images of a door labeled ""head"" off the bridge) but the point is that there are much fewer of them because most people on long range or exploration vessels are eating replicated food.

___

**Episode 6 - ""Terminal Provocations""**

* Boimler attempts to imitate the engine sounds of various starships. There is an ever-present ambient humming/pulsing sound in the background of many scenes in the franchise, and its ""soothing"" nature has inspired hours-long Youtube white-noise videos.
* The Drookmani are salvaging a vessel of the same design as the cargo drone ships in ""More Tribbles, More Troubles."" The design was retroactively used for the previously-unseen *Antares* in the remastered version of ""Charlie X,"" and the derelict's registry NCC-502 is one higher than that ship.
* The Drookmani's captain is voiced by JG Hertzler, whose varied Trek credits include General Martok, hero of the Dominion War and Chancellor of the Klingon Empire.
* The captain also sports an eye patch, which is clearly a reference to the panhandler in ""False Profits.""
* Shaxs continually suggests destroying the Drookmani freighter, and his advice is continually ignored. Worf suffered from the same malady throughout TNG as Picard preferred a diplomatic solution.
* The *Cerritos*' tractor beam makes the same noise as the one in TNG.
* Fletcher met Boimler at the Academy. The trope of ""old Academy buddy causing trouble"" is recycled again and again throughout Trek, perhaps most obviously with Kirk in TOS.
* Fletcher cites an incident in which Boimler nearly had his heart eaten by Nausicaans. These brutes were introduced in TNG as the Klingonesque troublemakers who fought a young Picard and stabbed him in the heart.
* Rutherford speculates the disputed cargo could contain ""cryo-frozen princesses;"" this is not a specific reference but people have been discovered cryogenically frozen in episodes like ""Space Seed,"" ""The Neutral Zone"" and ""The 37s.""
* Tendi thinks it might be the ""clamshell design"" communicators, evoking the flip-phones from TOS.
* When describing the benefits of holodeck training, Rutherford tediously name-drops famous figures previously seen in holodecks:
 * Sherlock Holmes - ""Elementary Dear Data"" et al.
 * Robin Hood - ""Qp--""...wait, that wasn't the holodeck.
 * Sigmund Freud - ""Phantasms""
 * Cyrano de Bergerac - ""The Nth De--""...wait, that wasn't the holodeck either.
 * Einstein - ""The Nth Degree"" and ""Descent""
 * da Vinci - ""Scorpion"" et al.
 * Stephen Hawking - ""Descent""
 * Socrates - ""Darkling""
* The Deckers have to mess with isolinear cores, which involves pulling out isolinear chips and putting them back in. TNG introduced isolinear chips as technobabble hardware usually serving as the circuitry or guts of a computer.
* The Zebulon Sisters and their Chu Chu Dance are not references, but Mariner saw them on Deep Space 3, a station briefly alluded to in ""Interface.""
* Badgey is more of a reference to external software assistants, but a computer helper was seen in the form of a fish in ""Rascals.""
* One of the plotlines in the episode is the famous ""holodeck gone wrong"" story required by WGA regulations for any series with a holodeck, where the slightest technical glitch elsewhere on the ship results in holograms running amok, turning self-aware and lethal, giving birth to Windows 95 screensavers, etc. The first such installment was ""The Big Goodbye,"" with a forerunner in ""The Practical Joker.""
* The design of the Bajoran marketplace does bear similarities to Bajoran architecture and other cultural references to that world, including the Bajoran ""logo"" used as the commbadge for DS9 crew.
* Freeman calls for evasive pattern Sulu Alpha. Hikaru Sulu, helmsman of the TOS *Enterprise*, knew his way around a fight and eventually became captain of the *Excelsior*, so it's only natural he would have inspired tactical maneuvers.
* Fletcher initially attempts to attack the core with a tool; the tool's design is familiar and is probably some kind of coupler or spanner or something but I'm unable to specify it.
* ""Environment 83"" is a frozen landscape; the broken holodeck in ""The Big Goodbye"" briefly switched to such a place.
* This week's ""Name the Species"" brings us a security officer with a set of forehead ridges/patterns. It is not a Xahean, as he blinks normally.
* Fletcher is reassigned to the *Titan,* presumably under the command of William T Riker heading up the Romulan task force after *Nemesis.*
* The keys to the captain's yacht are attached to a tribble keychain. Tribbles are the furry, cuddly, hungry, horny little breakfast cereals introduced in TOS.",startrek,Antithesys,False,/r/startrek/comments/iq2jpm/canon_references_terminal_provocations_spoilers/

54,"In Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, why were there complications when returning to the 23rd century?",1599699702,"Spock explains his difficulties calculating the trajectory needed for returning to the 23rd century by saying that the acceleration of the ship is ""no longer a constant"". (I inserted the dialogue below.) This is due to the additional mass of the whales and water on the ship. That seems so illogical to me, someone with nothing but high school grade knowledge of physics and talking out of my ass right now. 

First of all, the mass of the whale tank should not be impossible to measure. Since Spock was able to calculate the trajectory to travel to the 20th century with little data, why does having to weigh the whale tank pose such a challenge? Second of all, what does ""no longer a constant"" mean? The acceleration might have changed due to the additional weight, but it was always a variable, never a constant, and if he means to say that the weight has changed thus complicating his calculations, well, why don't they simply weigh the whale tank?! Why would Spock, of all people, rather take a *guess* than perhaps use a weighing device that surely must have existed by the 23rd century?

McCOY: You, ah... You present the appearance of a man with a problem.  
SPOCK: Your perception is correct, Doctor. In order to return us to the exact moment at which we left the twenty-third century, I have used our journey back through time as a reference, calculating the coefficient of elapsed time in relation to the acceleration curve.  
McCOY: Naturally. So what's your problem?  
SPOCK: Acceleration is no longer a constant.

67,Reimagining the Aliens/Evolutionary creature study: Vulcans,1599682722,"[So I started doing this](http://imgur.com/a/ulWRMa6) and probably shared it under a different account several years ago, but things have been really rough for me lately and I wanted to start back up again on this project and share what I've got!










One of the things that always bothered me as a kid watching the shows was that the aliens never seemed like aliens. Mostly just normal people with one insignificant change, which of course was due to budget reasons and being implanted with a humanoid seed in the galaxy, but I always thought, ""If the humanoid thing wasn't just around to explain away the budget, and we really did have all we could do, how would these be different?"" It's been a bit of a fun and interesting trek, but I've been toying with it and would love to share.









**Vulcan anatomy**




Vulcans are the quintessential ""alien"" and are closest allies in the Trek lore, and I wanted to show that part of them by going off of the Spirit that Roddenberry wanted which was little green men, but more human. The craniums are larger to hold bigger and more complex brains, their skin tone is more sallow and greenish (which is a reflection of Nimoy's makeup), and they are near universally taller than humans (average is 6'1"" or 187cm) with long fingers. Of course we all know about their pointed ears, which I've determined were more due to sexual selection than natural selection. While still sensitive, the length and position of the ears really doesn't have an effect on hearing for Vulcans.










As for the facial differences, I wanted Vulcans to be beautiful and regal in their appearance, but clearly alien and otherworldly, thus the high cheekbones, thin lips, and furrowed brows. I intentionally made the artistic choice to give them a protruding brow that was reminiscent of our neanderthals and thus big and brutish and not too bright, as was their history. Having something so attractive and logical still bear the marks of a species dominated by their emotions was compelling to me.









Vulcans have tiny nodes on their fingers that are capable of detecting and contracting pheromones, emotional chemicals, leading communicative consciousness factors (I assume they've figured out what consciousness is and that with the right nodes, you can transfer memories to someone else without words). This makes a scientific explanation for mind melds, and for why the fingers and the placement of them on the face is so important. It also helps explain the Vulcan death grip, which does not pinch certain nerves, but rather is a transference of emotional energy that completely disrupts the neural pathways of the victim temporarily.









Regarding Vulcan eyes, I made sure that they seemed cold and lifeless, thus making their eyes completely black except for 3-4 white pupils. In doing so, the Vulcan eyes have a terrifying effect, until looked at more closely, to see the wonder and depth they convey. Like stars in the night sky!








The rest of the anatomy is just riffing off of ENT. They have a second set of nostrils for pheremone detection (T'Pol mentions how much more sensitive Vulcans are to smell) and both nostrils are small to avoid dust inhalation on a nearly exclusively desert planet. This is also why they have two sets of eye lids, the second transparent and allows for seeing in sand storms. Lastly, as I'm a bit of a weirdo when it comes to Trek sexual organs because I'm fascinated from an evolutionary perspective how this all works, so I depicted no visible testicles, only one actually existing behind the bladder that continues to produce sperm that, if build up too much, will seep into Vulcan bloodstream and cause death. Their penis has ridges due to sexual selection and the women have no labia minora, and multiple clitoris that line the inside of the vaginal wall (thus the ridges in the men) but otherwise remain relatively similar to human sexual organs.








**Vulcan Evolution**

Vulcans as a species don't fit neatly into the human understanding of primates. They are certainly mammals, but their closest relatives would be something more akin to reptiles in their cold-bloodedness, scales (which they no longer have), and reptilian rationality in terms of emotional processing (which remains low. The disadvantage to this is that Vulcans are not good at keeping emotions as they cannot process them and think coherently at the same time. The advantage is that they are called of fully suppressing their emotions and engaging only in logical thinking). Whereas on earth humans could've only evolved after a hot and deeply tropical world cooled off, the opposite is the case for Vulcans. Their ancestors were already fairly well adapted herbivores and capable of bipedality, but due to a little understood catastrophic event, the planet became more arid and desert like, forcing Vulcans to adapt to the increase in dust and decay. This also helps explains why Vulcans are generally less inclined to form communities than humans are, as their environment typically favored scavenging for plant life in an already harsh climate. This enabled them to become slightly more omnivorous, though there are certainly variations of the communal/dietary aspect depending on the location of the population.








I didn't feel like I could devote any more time to their culture and music and religion which.is too vast to discuss and other things could handle that better than I could. I just wanted to give a different take on them and I intend to do so for several species. Tellarites are tomorrow and after that, Andorians.

I found this interesting, because Star Trek obviously promotes a great message of diversity and inclusion, and many/most Trek fans get that and agree with it. Sure some don't, but many certainly do.

80,Lower Decks: thought after the first episode,1599668782,"Before I get to this scene in Lower Decks, I want to rewind a moment for context.

One of my favorite sitcoms is Community.  One of the things I loved about it was how it was able to make jokes with and at the characters, but (usually) not at the expense of the characters.  And how it was able to treat parts of nerd culture with depth instead of just punchlines.

Case in point is that they did two episodes involving playing D&amp;D.   On other sitcoms, like Big Bang Theory, D&amp;D was the punchline.  “Yeah, but *you* play D&amp;D.”

In Community, in both episodes they made fun of some of the tropes, but also use the form of storytelling to allow characters to have real emotional moments, such as reconnecting an estranged father and son.


What does this have to do with Lower Decks?

In the pilot, “Second Contact”, Rutherford is on a date when the zombie outbreak happens.   He and Ensign Barnes manage to escape behind doors and have a passionate kiss.  He’s then totally distracted by wondering why the doors didn’t open correctly for their comnbadges.   She is annoyed that he cares more about that then the moment they shared.  

Later it shows they broke up, because he doesn’t understand why that wasn’t interesting to her.   In his words ‘Who has time for romance when there’s a level two diagnostics waiting to be run!”


In most shows, I would expect this to be the joke.  For the other characters to laugh at him, and point out that he needed to put aside his passion for discovery and engineering and connect with the hot woman.  (Honestly, I would even expect that to be the joke on The Orville which I love.)

But this is the moment where *Lower Decks* felt like true Star Trek to me.  The person he’s talking to reacts with a startled “What!” And then continues *agreeing* with him.

The joke isn’t look at this dork, the joke is the bait and switch of thinking that she’s going to react one way when she actually agrees.

My profession is a QA engineer, and this passion for making sure that the tools and products actually work the best is what I see daily on the best people in my job, and something I have myself.   It’s what drives us to working late or weekends, because if there’s anything that slips that we could have caught, I don’t care about stock prices or critical reception.  I care about making the product I spend my life working on the best it could possibly be, period.


Our crews, our heroes on Star Trek aren’t driven by greed (except Quark), or lusts or any of that. (Riker may have that as a motivation, but not his driving force.)

It’s that passion for doing something right, for discovering what’s out there, for science and for being the best you can be - that’s not a joke, but part of the core ethos of Star Trek.

The show is far from perfect, and could go many different ways.  But moments like that make be at least believe that the core is correct.   The humor isn’t everyones style - it’s not even completely my style.  I think they could dial it back about 20-30%.

The Body Electric

""Set nearly a decade after the conclusion of Star Trek: The Next Generation, The Body Electric explores an alternate reality in which Data adopted Timothy, the boy left orphaned after the tragic accident on the SS Vico.

24,"Klingon anatomy question (NSFW, but also serious)",1599606043,"So according to memory alpha, klingon biology is full of redundancies they call Brak'lul--you know, buncha extra ribs, third lung, second stomach, two cocks, etc.

(apparently the doubledick was canon before that discovery scene, which is, you know. thanks rick burman, very cool)

so do females have two vaginas leading to two wombs or to the same womb? or do they just have the one but they have two clits? Cuz like the clitoris exists in humans bc the fetal nerves that would grow out into a penis don't grow into that and just chill there instead, so if we assume that all the humanoids have roughly analogous evolutionary paths, which is a reasonable assumption since our galaxy was [seeded by ancient humanoids](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Humanoid#Ancient_origins), we can assume that klingon women have two clits. BUT!! we can't make any assumptions about the **k l i n g o n   v a g i n a s** off of this alone. 

see, the relationship between the clit and the penis—that they grow from the same cluster of cells in the fetus—is true for the vagina and testicles. In fact, if you have testicles, that seam down the middle is what would have been the opening to your vagina if you'd gotten different genetic information from your parents. Which is to say, *if we can deduce the nature of the klingon nutsack, we can understand the nature of klingon pussy.*

you ever have one of those moments where you realize what you've been doing for the last hour and wish you could stop but you've already invested so much time that you have to see it through? Yeah.

Okay, let's talk about probable layouts for the klingon nutte sack(s).

[Here](https://youtu.be/H2S6facaFFI), we can see from the urine stream that it looks like klingon dicks are arranged like
&gt; o

&gt; o

rather than 
&gt;o o

so my guess is that there's probably just the one sack underneath both of the dicks (although who KNOWS how many testes they have, what with Brak'lul and all that), which would imply that there's just the one vagine as well.

Let me take you all back to the wonderful mid-2000s— specifically, 2006: Halo 3 was on the horizon, the iPhone was but a forthcoming stock market shock in Apple’s labs, Battlestar Galactica was dominant, and ENT had been cancelled. After the back-to-back blows of 2003’s Nemesis being terrible and ENT ending on a middling note, the Trek franchise would remain dormant until 2009’s JJ Abrams reboot, and 2017’s Discovery. This timeline, the one we’re living in, now sees no less than five Star Trek shows about to be sharing an audience, three high grossing (if underwhelming to some) movies, and a reinvigorated franchise (that some of you no doubt hate, but that’s a different topic). 

Discovery’s new season features our crew lost in time, to the 32nd century. In this time, the Federation has all but collapsed, in the wake of a disaster known as the “Burn.” Discovery, having the spore drive and a crew of Starfleet officers still deep in the Federation spirit, sets out to unify the splintered Federation. 

Cool concept, I think it’ll be great, and I’m really excited. However, there’s a world in which we got this story ten years ago: enter, Star Trek: Federation, a show penned in concert by Robert Meyer Burnett and Geoffrey Thorne. Let’s run down some plot points, courtesy of this [Trekmovie article from 2011](https://trekmovie.com/2011/04/16/exclusive-details-excerpts-from-star-trek-federation-series-proposal/):

-	The way the team proposed shaking up that universe was to move the action to the year 3000 with a different United Federation of Planets. In Federation the UFP is still espoused to be a civilization of alien races united in respect living in a “Golden Age of Peace”, but not all is well...
-	Earth’s Humans have become “fat and happy” but this has led to complacency where humans are “giving up exploration for incremental colonization and focusing more on the rightness of their own cultural view over all others”
-	Many younger members of the UFP have left, eschewing this “human-centric” Federation
-	Starfleet has been reduced to a “mere peace-keeping force” protecting fringe worlds from aliens and from fighting each other, with starships are old and spread out too thin
-	The ship is described as not being too big “something bigger than Voyager, but nowhere near the size of The Battlestar Galactica”. 

Sound familiar? Now, let’s take a look at a contemporary competitor series, which was being developed for StarTrek.com around the same time: [Star Trek: Final Frontier](https://trekmovie.com/2010/05/03/update-on-star-trek-final-frontier-the-new-star-trek-animated-series-that-never-was/). 

Final Frontier was set in the 26th century, so a bit closer to contemporary than Disco S3. In Final Frontier’s setting, the Federation went to war with the Romulans, resulting in the wide scale use of weapons based on the Omega molecule, resulting in the Federation being decimated and splintered apart as warp travel became essentially impossible across vast swathes of space. The Federation turned insular, Starfleet became fully militarized, and the future became bleak...until the new captain of the newest Enterprise decided it’s time to get back to the roots of exploration, diplomacy, and adventure. 

Again...sound familiar?

Neither of these projects took off (though, Final Frontier was an official ST project with a fully fleshed out story, concept art, and scripts, all of which can be found [here](http://zeroroom.squarespace.com/). 

It seems like, along with fellow Roddenberry baby, Andromeda, Discovery has found inspiration in these defunct series. So, while we never got the revival of Trek on TV in the late 2000s, maybe we’ll get to see something like it, now. And, maybe, it won’t suck.

41,"In relation to the episode ""Far Beyond The stars"" I want to share my favorite piece of Comic Book History.",1599595495,"an Excerpt from David Hajdu's The Ten Cent Plague:  


The last comic book EC would ever publish was the February 1956 issue of Incredible Science Fiction, issued in November 1955. Feldstein, the editor, submitted the pages to Charles F. Murphy late in the summer of 1955. “Murphy always read our stuff himself,” Feldstein said. “I’d go in there with the pages, and all the little old ladies were reading everything else, and I’d have to wait until Murphy personally read our pages.” That issue of Incredible Science Fiction included a story, written by Jack Oleck and illustrated by Angelo Torres, about mutants. Murphy rejected it outright. “You can’t have mutants,” he said, as Feldstein remembered.

“So I went back to the office, and I said, ‘Bill, what are we going to do? We got a deadline.’ He said, ‘Well, let’s pull out an old one’—one that we already used before the Code but was clean enough to pass. So I dug out one of my favorite pieces.” Written late in 1952 and originally published the following spring, the story, “Judgment Day!” was one of what Feldstein called his “preachies”; a science-fiction allegory about race, it followed an astronaut from Earth as he inspected a planet populated by self-replicated robots, some painted orange and some blue, but identical mechanically. When the Earthman saw that the orange ones had subjugated the blue ones to poverty and servitude, he declined to welcome the robots into the galactic union. The last panel of the story showed the astronaut back in his spaceship; with his helmet removed, we see that he is black-skinned. “In the 1950s, when I wrote it, that was a pretty strong message,” Feldstein said. “You know, a message of hope for the future of what was then a terribly segregated society.” Indeed, when “Judgment Day!” was first published the Chicago Defender devoted an editorial to recounting the story, which the newspaper praised for combining “the lure of color and fantasy with educational propaganda.”

Murphy read the pages impassively. “He got to the last panel,” Feldstein said, “and he looked up at me, and he said, ‘No. You can’t have a Negro.’

“I said, ‘Why not?’

“He said, ‘You can’t have a Negro.’

“I said, ‘Where in the Code does it say that I can’t depict a Negro?’

“He said, ‘I say you can’t have a Negro.’

“I said, ‘That’s the point of the whole story.’

“‘No.’

“So I said, ‘Bye.’”

Feldstein returned to the EC office and protested to Gaines. “I said, ‘Bill, this is impossible. It just can’t work. They are after our ass, and they’re going to find any excuse to give us a hard time.’ And Bill called up Murphy and said, ‘What the hell is going on?’

“And Murphy said, ‘You can’t have a Negro.’

“And Bill said, ‘Okay. I’m going to have a press conference, and I’m going to tell the public that the comic-book authority is a racist authority that will not permit black people to have equal depiction’ or something like that.” After a pause to reflect, Murphy granted Gaines permission to publish the story, on the condition that the beads of perspiration on the black astronaut’s face be removed. (Feldstein’s text ended with a purple flourish: “And the instrument lights made the beads of perspiration on his dark skin twinkle like distant stars …”) Gaines said, “Fuck you,” hung up on Murphy, and published the story intact.",startrek,Jedi_Knight_TomServo,False,/r/startrek/comments/ip1087/in_relation_to_the_episode_far_beyond_the_stars_i/

First of, Saru’s people well below a warp tech civilization and the Prime Directive dont allow to start first contact with them. Second, she is violated the spacefaring Ba’ul territory, without permission landed on their planet and intervene with their culture. Third, the Ba’ul see the Kelpiens as their property, so I dont think they allowed her to take away Saru, basically she is stolen from them.

We see many times that the Prime Directive prevent the starfleet officers to help, influence or contaminate other more primitive civilizations and their evolution. Also dont let them to intervene with other species or society is internal affairs and many more things.

83,The Context of Mariner's Flashback,1599565533,"Lower Decks Episode 5 gave us a wonderful flashback sequence to Mariner's service aboard the USS *Quito*, now revealed to be an *Olympic*-class vessel. The scene depicts Mariner and two friends, Angie and Niko, wearing the FC/DS9 uniforms while Angie shares gossip about the events of the TNG two-parter *Descent*, where Data's brother Lore teamed up with the Borg for some good moustache-twirling villany.

Due to the ongoing debate about Mariner's age and service history within Starfleet, this scene has prompted a lot of debate as to 'when' it takes place, with some arguing that the uniforms benchmark it to somewhere between 2373-2379 (the TNG Movie Era), while others argue that it's set sometime shortly after *Descent* (c. 2370) because Angie is treating the gossip as fresh news. 

The distinction is important because one scenario establishes Beckett has having served at least a decade in the fleet since graduating from the Academy. The other grants more leeway.

I fall among those who feel flashback is not concurrent with the events of *Descent* - I simply can't see the 'First Contact' uniforms being in-service three years ahead of their introduction aboard the *Enterprise*, Starfleet's flagship. Instead I would argue that Angie is presenting her news as 'fresh' in the sense that it is new to her, Niko and Mariner, and her dialogue itself supports this view:

*""Oh! You hear what happened on the Enterprise? Apparently, Data's got an evil twin brother, who teamed up with the Borg.""*

Look at the statement in full. Angie is not just reporting that Lore has teamed up with the Borg, but that Lore even *exists*. That changes everything. Even in a scenario where this flashback takes place right after the events of Descent (c.2370), that part of the news announcing Lore's existance is still six years out-of-date (Lore was introduced in TNG S1, c.2364). 

With that established, it becomes easier to accept the flashback as taking place some years 'after the event', presumably as a result of events regarding Lore having been classified and then leaked out in the form of gossip/scuttlebutt among the ships of the fleet.",startrek,rbdaviesTB3,False,/r/startrek/comments/ios2rz/the_context_of_mariners_flashback/

She was 64, and as far back as I can remember, we watched lots of TOS and TNG as a family, TNG premiered when I was 1 in 1987, so my parents were pretty excited because TNG, obviously.

I think that growing up in that environment helped in developing what I consider pretty good ideals, like learning, exploration, understanding, open-mindedness, and diplomacy.

I am not trying to say I'm a stuck up, holier than thou, elitist, narcissist. I'm not better than any other person, but my parents believed that we could live in a world that could be similar to Star Trek someday, I still to this very day believe that we will get there, or close to something like it.

All that aside, since the 2nd, I have been leaning on and also trying to support my dad and sister, we're all pretty devastated. It's like being ripped in half.

As I now (and have been for a few days) binge and bounce around between series, I'll get nice little memories of my mom here and there, and it's holding me together. The pain of loss is overwhelming, but watching Trek is like a hand on my shoulder. She believed so strongly in the great messages of the series, too many to name here.

This is going to have to be my new life, my new frontier, my voyage in a life without my mom, who has, and always will be, my friend. I will make her proud, by celebrating her life.

Then I jumped into DS9 and paid attention to every episode. If I fell asleep or wasn’t paying attention, I’d rewatch from the last thing I remember as the story arcs were much more important. Next to the EMH, Quark is probably my second favorite trek character.

Moments ago I finished the finale to ENT. As far as the actual show goes, it was brilliant. So many tie ins and little Easter eggs that I noticed that would come into play in (the shows timeline’s) future.

5,I got to show off my VOY knowledge today,1599530001,"I was posting in another sub and I compared something to how Janeway changed writers and personalities like ten times, all because no one knew how to write her as a woman, and woman captain. And Kate Mulgrew, whom if I remember, was also one of the writers for a time (don't quote me on that, I do know Jeri Ryan [Seven] did) kinda got in on it and said Janeway changed personalities so many times that she wouldn't be surprised if they went back and said Janeway had some sort of undiagnosed mental disorder the whole time. 

And I didn't mention this because it wasn't relevant to the topic, but what really didn't help was how when a new writer picked up Janeway, they would not just write her the way they wanted to, but kinda overdo it in order to put their foot down, so to speak, and ""solidify"", ""codify"", etc. that this is her personality from then on. Which is all well and good, until the next writer wants to set the record straight and put their foot down, and Janeway's personality gets yanked in a complete other direction.

7,"""Faith of the Heart"" vs ""Archer's Theme"" = ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" vs ""Surrender (Tomorrow Never Dies)""",1599527931,"*So, firstly, let me preface by saying I absolutely love Faith of the Heart, and it's my favourite theme in the franchise, but if this sub has taught me anything, it's that that is a* ***very*** *niche opinion.* 

Anyway, as far as I can tell people generally prefer Archer's Theme to Faith of the Heart. I also feel that Archer's Theme is absolutely fantastic, and even though it has a bit of a different flavour than other Trek themes by including the electric guitar, I still think it would fit in well among the others. Were it to have been Enterprise's theme, I think it still would have been my favourite in the franchise. It sounds grand, and moving, and to me, very ""Trek""... and it should, as it was originally intended to be the opening theme. You can see how well it fits here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsn2xVmVuGE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsn2xVmVuGE)

This whole scenario is very reminiscent of the snafu with the James Bond movie *Tomorrow Never Dies.* KD Lang wrote an absolutely incredible theme called ""Surrender (Tomorrow Never Dies)"", which in my opinion would have been one of the alltime greatest Bond themes, but because Sheryl Crow won a couple of Grammys that year, she was tapped to record an alternate theme called ""Tomorrow Never Dies"", and KD Lang's brilliant piece was relegated to the end credits. Sheryl Crow's song isn't generally very well liked, and is often ranked quite low among Bond themes. Rolling stone pegged it at 16 out of then 22. Any list will have it in the bottom half. 

Check out the differences here:

12,Infiltration missions and local language,1599525622,"I have spent a good amount of time researching this online and looking for satisfying threads but couldn’t really find a good explanation for this question: in-universe, was it ever revealed how Picard communicated with the Romulans during the infiltration mission that one time? Similar examples include Number One and Troi with the Mintakans, the ENT crew on that world I forgot the name of but it was a pre-warp world, when Kira was turned into a Cardassian and her faux father was supposed to believe that was his real daughter... wouldn’t she have spoken Bajoran? Or at least Cardassian with a Bajoran accent? Or did they have a common language? 

In instances where it’s a federation world, I assume there’s a common language that everyone knows how to speak at least in starship crews, and that there’s a certain number of key languages that everyone must be fluent in. With other worlds that aren’t members or known species but are technologically advanced enough, the use of the translators when available isn’t an issue as they probably have their own devices that do the same thing albeit looking different / being in different locations and forms. 

I am totally willing to suspend disbelief with accents or lack thereof, lack of lag in translation and various minor things that make for better TV and assume in-universe things wouldn’t be as flawless as depicted, that’s fine. 

But plot wise, I feel like we should have had an answer for cases like infiltrations or disguise. If anyone knows, thanks for pointing them out. I wonder if it is known that Picard and maybe the senior staff aboard TNG speaks Romulan fluently, or if an advanced device was made for language issues in infIltration scenarios, or do Romulans speak... English? lol And with the Mintakans I really wanna know, did Riker speak to them in their language without an accent or did he have a translator and how come they didn’t say anything about the translator being in use? Surely they would have noticed and it should have scared them? 

Do translators somehow cancel out the original audio and replace it with translated language in the speakers voice with the perfect accent required to avoid suspicion? And somehow lip movements are ignored? How do the translators anticipate what language the receiver wants to hear without having heard their voice first? Is it then more than audio-space-waves manipulations but some sort of telepathic tech? It would have to be but was this ever mentioned in-universe?",startrek,treesofeden,False,/r/startrek/comments/iojpuo/infiltration_missions_and_local_language/
13,Voyager Cast Change - Nix Chakotay,1599525082," A hypothetical for Star Trek fans. Robert Beltran (Chakotay) reportedly did not enjoy working on Voyager, reportedly he signed up to work with Janeway's original actor and didn't get along with Mulgrew. As the story goes, he rebelled by intentionally acting wooden and at one point demanded an exorbitant pay raise in an attempt to be fired from his contract but got the raise instead.

In Scorpion, Harry Kim was injured with the intention of killing the character as the writers hated him or something, until Garrett Wang was listed as a Top X Sexiest Actors and they ejected Kes instead. (Jennifer Lien initially found out about this by reading the script...)

So... what if they'd nixed Chakotay instead of Kim or Kes and we still got 7 of 9? I'm thinking Paris, oddly enough, would be the new XO. Lots of room for character growth there with the rebellious son making good as well as shaking up the character dynamics.

Though I'm not sure the show would need THREE exterior viewpoint characters with Neelix, Kes, and 7. Never really enjoyed Kes, I mean she was so soft spoken and while she had some good moments (the telepathic attack, Warlord, etc) she was just kinda.... there and worked mainly for exposition.

Granted, perhaps they could still write out Kes and we'd get a new recurring character either as a pilot or perhaps do something interesting like promote Kim to Lt jg and put him at conn and someone like Carey or Rawlins (from the pilot ep) at Ops.

They knew exactly what to do and say... Was it because one of the vials was full? I thought Cpt. Sisko tells Nog that they'll be long gone before they notice the explosives.

I can imagine back in the day something like introversion was seen as purely bad character traits. Let's not even talk about how the Autism spectrum might have been seen.

19,TNG: Or how I learned to love star trek,1599520251,"
5 months ago a virgin Trekkie set out for brave new worlds watching Star Trek: The Next Generation for the first time. These are his stories. 

At the start of quarantine lockdown I started Star Trek for the first time. Guided by an expert, we dug in to each episode and gave our 2 cents.

Season 1 is casual. Individual episode descriptions hit at season 2. 

season/ep notes available if you're interested. Ratings out of 4. Side note: i dont play with mind control, body swap or amnesia. Mild spoilers and also riker is super horny.

Anyways, I loved it and thought about sharing the strange journey with others. With Star Trek day closing in, it seemed like the right time.

Klingon war


Space Travelling creature that serves as a vehicle for an ethical dilemma


Time-Travel epsiode with wacky character

All make for a solid number of episodes with a series or season arc, but the show just feels off to me. 


1) Production Value

Production value for this show is real real high compared to previous series, as a result, we are seeing a lot more of the ship and of space. The ship looks wrong as a result, so from the outset, we have a ship that is not what we are used to

Then, the set design is quite varied, and instead of having those few familiar sets, we have some of those plus a ton of other spaces that are new and remain unfamiliar  


2) Camera angles/number and editing

This show, as a result of its production value, has access to way more cameras and editing than the previous shows did, and as a result, the blocking or setup, I don't know the technical terms, are something Star Trek fans are definitely not used to. We are used to single camera one takes where actors look for their mark to stand on the floor and stand way too close to one another in order to be center frame. We are NOT used to 2 or even 4 different camera angles for a single shot and then cutting rapidly and abundantly as each character talks. There are a lot of over the shoulder conversation scenes in this show, and in a show with such heavy expesition, this gets kinda old


3) Tone


I can't tell if the tone of the show is more serious, or the 90s were so long ago those shows feel hokey now, but the charm that a Star Trek episode has where it feels partly serious, partly quirky, and partly kinda dumb, but a dumb you are in on, just isn't there with this show. There is a serious attempt being made by the show to be a good Star Trek show, I can feel it. But I just wonder what it needs exactly to get there. Like Rain Wilson as Harry Mudd is a great choice, and I can totally see that being a TMG episode where some guy with a time device has a vendetta against Picard, but its something about the camera angles, the decisions of who to focus on, the editing, something is making it more serious than it needs to be. 

I guess one thing about those old shows is that it never TRULY felt life or death, like we always knew the Federation would win, but we wanted to know how. How, as Red Foreman says, was way cooler than actually winning. This show seems to have higher stakes by having a more serious tone, also the episodes feel far more connected than previous series. Used to be that ya kinda tuned in each week to see what wacky adventure the gang would get into this time, with only carry-over happening some of the time, now, each episode or event seems like super serious and oh my god he made it out alive but is he okay? 

Used to be, he made it out alive and so yes he is okay. 


4) Klingons. 


I dunno what the vibe on the Klingon change is like, but I hate the Klingons. The enemies have NEVER been this dark and scary. Klingons in previous series were great warriors yes, but it was almost a joke watching them drink themselves silly and sing songs and declare themselves mighty warriors and etc. And now? Oh my god, these monsters are here to hunt down humanity!

It brings something new to the show, but that new thing makes the show much more serious, and I don't know if I like a serious Star Trek. I miss old Star Trek, this new era just seems to miss the mark those other shows did. 

I will say, I plan on watching the show. It's still interesting, and It has potential, but it certainly feels a bit off.",startrek,Ch_IV_TheGoodYears,False,/r/startrek/comments/ioct2k/star_trek_discovery_is_a_good_star_trek_spinoff/

I just watched episode one with Chris Pike and was amazed at the dialogue.    For 1960s US, it was so complex, and layered with many implications.    The acting and expressions implied that it wasn't my interpretation but the clear purpose.

\[Old Trek means ST before &amp; including Enterprise; New Trek means Discovery &amp; beyond\]

**The Style**

Star trek, originally, was a show of curiosity. Mysteries, discoveries, inventions, cultures, phenomena and more waiting to be stumbled upon in the vast expanses of space. What mattered most was what was in space. The romances, the jokes, the relations, the arguments, and the weirdness certainly were an integral part of every episode but remove the space setting and you would've never had a successful show. That isn't the case anymore. Space isn't so mysterious anymore but it isn't so welcoming either. Decades of looking out to the sky to find out that there wasn't much out there. And the fervour of the space race was never carried forward to the 21st Century. Space on its own is no longer interesting (unless you've interstellar level ideas), but instead what happens in space, how we react to it, is the one that matters (See Expanse, Another Life, Origin, The First, etc.). And of course, comedic shows based in space (Space force, Orville, LD, etc.). Basically, even though all space shows are space operas, (old) ST was more a show about space whereas (new) ST was a show about us in space.

**Lengths of Storylines**

And the length of each story has changed too. Having a season-long storyline before 2000s was considered bad/stupid/not preferred because it discouraged people from getting in later. If you're lucky, the show could be replayed or you got your hands on a VHS, CD, etc. But more likely than not you still would've preferred to pay less for more, so the demographic who bought the entire series would be a small percent of those watching the series. Basically TOS, TNG, VOY, LD. Even DS9 &amp; ENT had mostly made episodes with a definite ending. Enter streaming services (or just the internet). You could archive older videos (and add ads if you're money hungry) allowing anyone to join the series at any time. This comes with the added bonus that if the show's premiering, you've basically addicted the audience till the end of the season (or if you're particularly evil, the end of the show). Mainly DIS, PIC, and last episodes of DS9 (&amp; Xindi Arc).

**The Differentiating Factor**

And addressing the (tabooic) social issues of the time was a major point in all Star Trek, if not the differentiating factor from other scifi shows. The 'Golden Age' shows &amp; TOS addressed highly controversial but important social issues (which were mainly person-based) of that time (Kirk's 'womanizing' was meant to take the censors' attention from the more controversial aspects of TOS) and even had dedicated episodes for a single issue (usually using some alien problem similar to what we have/had). The problems now aren't on the scale of the person but on the scale of the people, such as Climate Change, Poverty, Obesity. These are easy enough to emulate, but not so easy in the universe of ST in which these are supposedly eradicated. Not for the lack of trying though with Hugh &amp; Stamets in Discovery and Machine Rights in Picard (one more byte could mean sentience, so...).

**The Flaws (mainly DIS)**

* Michael Burnham's character (Do I need to say more?)
* The continuity craziness. The problem isn't Tech such as holograms (The holograms in TNG are Tactile, the ones in DIS aren't, which is a major difference) as most tech have developed a lot in 50 yrs IRL, nor is it the Klingon (as every show has a problem with it, TNG-Mixed to the side of Dishonorable, DS9- Mostly Honorable, TOS- Villains, ENT- Everything with a side to the anitvillainous, etc) but plain old history (again, Do I need to say more?).
* The existence of too much fan-service.
* Not sure if this is a flaw or not, but almost all sci-fi shows nowadays have their plot based on cataclysmic (galaxy ending) event, with every episode playing some part in advancing towards it. Nothing is thought of the little things, the things that give it life. (Old) Trek had episodes specifically made for comedic relief, other storylines, character development, etc. You had Fair Haven, Tribbles, Q-pisodes, Vic Fontaine, Shore leave, Carbon Creek and more, adding in air of reality &amp; relatability. These no longer exist in New Trek (other than specific shows such as LD), which, I think, is one big mistake in the part of New ST. 

**Why Lower Decks is Different**

And then there is Lower Decks. I haven't seen it yet (damn you CBS for allowing it only in US), so take my opinion with a grain of salt. From what I've seen, most people feel that it's the show that resembles the most to conventional Star trek. But it's the most unconventional of ST too. They have managed to successfully combine the styles of today with animation with humor with (Old) Trek successfully, where others have failed. Still it's one show &amp; one show alone trying to take on the mantle of ST (from how most feel about it), while simultaneously trying on something new. So it alone (or others like it) won't be enough to carry ST forward. 

**Conclusion**

Basically, Star Trek can't survive now with the same formula of previous ST shows. And if nearly destroying the ST feel by making DIS &amp; PIC more like a 21st century space-fi lets Star Trek continue, maybe it's not too bad of a trade. After all ENT was considered bad when it was released but has now ALMOST reached the level of TNG. And almost every Gen Z will have a hard time getting interested in TOS at first. So who knows how it will be perceived a few years from now.

Ultimately change is inevitable. You can either be with it (&amp; change into the uncertain) or be against it (&amp; be forgotten). Maybe you've managed to come close to both like Lower Decks, but in the end the old way of ST just isn't viable anymore.",startrek,DarthMaw23,False,/r/startrek/comments/io7glf/why_discovery_picard_soontobereleased_are_good/

The main argument being that you should be able to enjoy any episode even when watched out of order. The other side seems to favor the model supposedly championed by DS9 where episodes can build on one another story-wise. The argument here being that it allows for much greater character development as there is less need to always default to a tabula rasa after 50 mins of show.

I've been on the DS9 side of the discussion usually. But recently I started to re-watch all of TNG in order. Today it was ""Reunion"" and I've been thinking. Why is it that TNG fans claim it would adhere to the TOS formula? That might have been largely true up to season 3 but especially with season 4 I see a lot of plot and character development that would make absolute zero sense when watched out of order.

Take ""Reunion"" for example, it is crucial to establishing who Worf and Alexander are. It also deals with information that the viewer can only have if one did watch the earlier episode introducing Duras.

I'm not complaining. I'm actually delited in finding such nice character development in TNG.

14,Honest opinions about ST Discovery and Picard?,1599404914,"So I started watching ST Discovery and Picard excited to see new Star Trek shows, but unfortunately in the end I get disappointed with the productions.

With Discovery after a few episodes in noticed that I really dont like Burnham or that the show constantly focusing on her. Despite she is lived in Vulcan and wants to be like them, she is too emotional, have unlogical decissions and makes very terrible things. Literally everything revolves around her and just her alone, other characters dont really matter. Like in the time loop episode we see Burnham and not Stamets who trying to save the ship or season 2 they literally needed to introduce the bridge crew because no one knows their names. They really made her this know at all, smug, praise me and love me character without any redeeming quality. 

The plots, story telling and execution not just not makes sense as a prequel but as a star trek show at all. The Klingorcs and everything about them dont look, dont behave and dont feel like real Klingons at all. How they ended season 1 and made L'Rell the chancellor with that bomb was a cowardly act and ridiculous. An open up and widely known Section 31 makes no sense. The Control taking over the humans and wants to destroy every living things is a meh borg ripoff. Again season 2 also feels like a Burnham show, everything is focusing on her, not just she was the most important character in the last season is mirror universe story arc, but now the Red Angel also just connected to and just about her alone. Literally everyone just throws away their entire lifes to follow Burnham for no reason at all. The fights, space battles, CGI and visual effects more seems like from a star wars movie. I literally rolled my eyes when seen the 100+ shuttles and drones from the Enterprise, its just looked so bad and was too stupid. Making the Discovery incidents a secret and the entire crew is nonexistent was dump and dont solved anything.

Oh STPicard, I can wrote a whole essay how its feels like a cheap fanfiction what's wants to piss over the real Picard is character and legacy. We really dont see anything from the old wise, charismatic and borned leader Picard. This is a mentally and physically old, fragile and broken man with regrets, shame and self-loathing. He literally do nothing in the show just there for be a background accessory, a useless relic and a memberberry. The story has so much unused Chekhov's gun, plot hole and missed opportunity in the end its become ridiculous. What about the hologram AI's, they are for some reason okay, even when we all know that they are just as dangeruos and deadly as androids. What about Raffi is conspiracy theory crazy and junkie theme or her son and his romulan girlfriend. What about how the old romulan space become a lawless no man is land and Seven become a Ranger, whatever is it. Really what about Seven's personality takes a total 180 degree turn and by no means seems like the cold, analytic or self-confident we known. What about Agnes Jurati is a romulan spy and with cold blood kills Maddox and they forget it in the next episode. Everyone is cool with it, wants to be her friend and dont give this killer to the authorities. What about the Borg cube, the liberated exdrones and Seven become their borg queen, yeah they dont matter and written out by a floating space flower. What about the romulan spy and federation traitor Comodor Oh, they really let her go with that many blood in her hands. What about the romulan spy Narek who in the last episode just disappear without any explanation. What about the so feared admonition prophecy and the godly space AI's. There are so much more bad, missed or stupid things we can list them for hours Hugh, Elnor, Itcheb and many more.

They are both a bad dystopian future with a very poorly written plot, bad execution and disconnected story parts. Its feels like the writters dont really understand what made Star Trek great, so it's missing the spark/heart/soul the originals have. They brought back the old characters just to win over the fans, then dont do with them anything or disrespect them is a very bad idea. They really need to let the old characters go to remain them as epic as they were.

Because that show was made over 50 years ago and our definitions of ""futuristic"" simply change over time. When TOS came out, there were no mobile phones yet- nowadays, the concept of a communicator is something you use everyday. 

Touchscreens and Holograms are also something id expect in a sci fi movie nowadays instead of analog controls. Holodeck simulations may have existed in the 2250s already, just not for recreational purposes.

In general i´m fine with retconning some technology, since Star Trek is not supposed to be ""retrofuturistic"".

The two reasons I can think of are:

* The Gorn actor couldn't see out of his mask, so they couldn't really choreograph the same level of fighting with one person blind. But it still feels like some work could have been done with that choreography.
* The point of the fight was to show Kirk could not match Gorn physically, so all of his attacks had to be ineffectual. Combine this with the above, and you've got a blind lizard-man slowly swinging his arms to not actually hurt someone, while Kirk flails pointlessly at Gorn.

One aged mid-30’s, one aged late 70+ explorer. s. 30’s Captain commands a light frigate (design undecided)equipped for 10 year expedition, equipped with trans warp and armored like a battleship. 70 year old explorer has a ship similar in size to the NX-01 (might actually use NX design). It would be equipped with trans warp communications and trans warp powered sensors. It would also be heavily armored and more modernly equipped, be mostly automated and have a crew of 100+-. The Admirals ship would be a heavily modified Excelsior Class, fresh out the space dock and one year shakedown. She would be equipped with the latest in everything to include Borg Tech. 

The 3 ships are jumping to the deepest unexplored sector (Beta Quadrant?). 

Mission: Launch to deep system coordinates, secure sector jump point. Mine system. System by system survey of region and catalog EVERYTHING. Travel at traditional warp after transwarp jump from Earth. Make trade deals or alliance offers where possible. Destroy any threat to the Federation member planets and any non-warp capable planets in the Federation. (Very Vague) (Lets Admiral and Ambassador staff write Federation legal code for newly explored sectors) 

Duration: 10 years. At 10 year mark, fleet will communicate with star fleet and will assess federation leadership. If results are favorable, and ships are to continue mission if not at Earth before termination.

Goal: survey from Sector 001, out 10 years and back to Earth. Transmit Data, refit, and relaunch. Survey would be performed in a 20 degree arch (if you look at the galaxy in 2D). Asses potential allies/ combat threats to future Federation interests.

It could fly at nearly mach II, and while the Mk1 had a combat ceiling of 55,000ft, the Mk2 was expected to be able to reach altitudes of 70,000 ft, putting it close to being on par with the US's current top dog fighter, the F-22 (in those areas).

Amazing, notable, terrible TOS moment 1: S02E11 - Friday's Child. Timestamp 13:33. A guy in solid purple gets stabbed in a battle. What happens next, I predict, is production went to lunch. When they came back, they forgot who got stabbed and replaced him with a guy in orange. They pick back up filming mid-stab and depict the stab with a the sword-in-armpit trick. To be clear: Man in purple runs up, gets stabbed, randomly changes costume color, and clearly has this sword under his armpit.

Amazing, notable, terrible TOS moment 1: S02E21 - Patterns of Force. Timestamp 35:57. The away team finds themselves on Planet Nazi and need to get behind a guarded door. They pose as Nazis filming a propaganda video for the Reich. It becomes immediately clear the plan is to knock out the guards when they get close but they have two guards and only one Vulcan and Kirk could never get the hang of the Vulcan nerve pinch. ""What will they do?"" I ask. ""Surely it will be a case of a single judo chop taking out a guard."" Nope. The guard is lovingly hugged unconscious, grimacing deeply at the gentle embrace.

Putting aside the uncanny resemblance between Gillen and Ruck, I think this could actually be a fun character to explore. His shitty Captain’ing, in the eyes of the public pre-Generations anyway, played a role in the death of the greatest hero Starfleet has ever known. What is his life like after that? So often we see captains who are master tacticians or eloquent diplomats. What is the life and adventures of a guy who just had a sort of average career, put in his time, and eventually landed a job he probably shouldn’t have had like? Especially when it starts with such an epic disaster. I think his story could actually be an interesting one to tell, and if anyone could give this character the emotional pull he needs, it’s Gillen.

I remember one specific episode of Voyager where  (somehow  Paris got back to Earth) and was traveling around the city via his friend's  ""personal site-to-site transporter"". 

This brings up a bunch of security questions. For example, locks on doors or doors themselves would be obsolete unless there was some regulation, monitoring of civilan transporters.   Does every building have a ""personal shield""?

80,Is Star Trek a Religion?,1599324596,"When I was growing up in the 60's my dad was in the US Air Force. He had some very intense experiences during WWII than made him somewhat religious in a very moderate Christian way. No preaching or church going at my house. 

I think his beliefs got him through some really horrific stuff during the war.

I realized that by 1975 I had become such a Star Trek follower than I had memorized entire  scripts of TOS. Was Star Trek my religion?

I would walk like Captain Kirk. And remain calm as Mr. Spock. I tried my best to have the logical answer and to be as knowledgeable as Spock. But sometimes you had to get in someone's face. I would be all dramatic like Kirk. 

When I was 13 years old I had a hallway in my parents house that I changed to a Enterprise corridor complete with a duplicate intercom station set into he wall and a red light behind recessed plexiglass panels in the ceiling. 

When I was in High School and College I looked like a musician. Long hair. Could have been the drummer for Black Sabbath. No one knew I was a geek except my girlfriend. I was lucky I had a lot of girlfriends. Like you know who. We put on a pretty bad show down there. 

I didn't collect models, I didn't go to conventions. I never wore anything ever that said ST. 

I actually worked in Hollywood and gravitated towards a career simply because the room I was working in was like a starship bridge. I designed it so why not.

I started a business when I was 26 and the biggest problem I had was not realizing people would not work together like Starfleet personnel. Meaning they would be self serving combative and well just normal humans. The politics and back backbiting were horrible and I would alternate between Kirk and Spock to deal with it. Formation L. Stop it? I'm counting on it!. 

For years I had the idea that if I needed to I could remove one circuit card from one sync generator and my entire business would stop functioning. The self destruct mechanism. You may control the ship, but I control the computer. Mine is the final command. 

For decades because I never grew out of it when I would go into important business meetings I would be Captain Kirk. I would say Phasers on stun under my breath. I would hum original music cues from TOS like going into a commercial. This meeting will not last longer than three minutes. 

Star Trek got me through so many bad situations. I would repeat ""The bullets are an illusion"" over and over. ""Don't tell me that again science officer it is a theory it can be done!"" 

To this day when I get in a elevator I say ""Bridge"" and turn the nonexistent turbo lift control. 

And here I am. I have moved to a country that is as close to being stuck on a alien world that has be contaminated by Star Fleet technology as you can get. All I have to do is not let them know who I am. 

The truth is now I am more like Captain Pike watching Vina dance in a Talosian illusion than Kirk or Spock. Or sort of stuck in the Negative Universe or maybe I am the evil Captain Kirk from a transporter malfunction.

 I think I got tired of deciding who lives and who dies.

82,When I think mutiny should be considered ok,1599324474,"Mutiny, the act of rebelling against a superior officer, whether it be an admiral, captain or senior officer is considered illegal. It is illegal since it could involve killing and it disrupts command, causing chaos. However there is no canon reference when talking about mutiny. (Specifically violations)

\- First of all, I think it shouldn't be called a mutiny but rather command correction (in the case of a mutiny being ok). 

\- Command corrections would require the following:

\- If you think your superior or fellow officer has committed a violation of protocol, check to see if they have even violated a regulation. 

\- Contact a superior officer, whether that be the captain or a flag officer. They will give you temporary power and authority to relieve of duty and send the accused to the brig. 

\- If there is no superior officer available (whether it be a commander in chief, or stranded), contact the next superior officer (e.g. contact your commander if the captain has made a violation). 

\- When performing a command correction, phasers must be set to stun only. Killing the violator or their supporters will result in a stripping of rank and charge of murder. 

\- After a command correction has been performed, a new officer must take their place immediately. 

\- A starship crew should rendezvous at a star base unless instructed otherwise by Star fleet. In case there is no penal colony or starbase available, the accused should be restricted to quarters until otherwise. The brig will be a last option. 

\- You could receive a medal for carrying out command correction and/or a promotion, possibly even taking the corrected's place and rank.",startrek,Status738,False,/r/startrek/comments/in4e8d/when_i_think_mutiny_should_be_considered_ok/
83,"Raktajino, a warriors drink!",1599323910,"Yes yes, before you comment I know that Prune Juice is in fact the true warriors drink (TNG: ""Yesterday's Enterprise""), but it has such a good ring to it and plays into my take of the popular Klingon coffee drink.

I am currently rewatching DS9 for the first time in 10 years and now that I am a coffee lover I have been dying to have a Raktajino. In looking at previous recipes posted in this sub and elsewhere online I found myself somewhat wanting. Something about a spiced coffee drink similar to that of a Pumpkin Spice Latte doesn't quite sit right to me. I am willing to accept that Raktajino may in fact just be a Klingon adaptation of an earth Cappuccino and that the climate on Kronos has lead to beans grown there to have what humans would perceive as a spiced flavor, but I have come up with a different take that fits my head cannon much better.

In my head cannon Raktajino would be similar to the Bulletproof Coffee that we have today! If Klingons were to adapt a human coffee drink, how could it be anything other than that? A high calorie coffee drink that provides you plenty of energy to keep fighting the enemies of Kahless for hours! Below is my recipe for a Bulletproof Raktajino.


15g fresh ground (medium-fine) coffee. I use a darker roast for this drink to provide a little more bitterness, but a medium roast would be good as well. Don't use anything super expensive, but don't use pre-ground Folgers either.

250ml boiling water. I have found that a 60g/L ratio of coffee to water to be the most enjoyable for pour over coffee, but use however much water you want to brew your preferred size cup of coffee.

- Once your coffee is brewed, add the following -

1tsp - 1Tbl Kerrygold Butter, or other high quality butter. This will provide the slight sweetness to the drink. It is best to use a grass fed butter if you want to substitute.

1tsp - 1Tble MCT Oil or Coconut oil.

1 scoop Collagen powder, optional.

- Mix everything together in a blender or using a whisk and enjoy! -

99,Klingons are not cool,1599308412,"Forget everything you know about Klingons. Now Imagine I was going to describe them to you. 

Klingons are a race that place all importance on hand to hand combat. Most important decisions are made by hand to hand combat. For example: who will rule the Klingon Empire- decided by hand to hand combat, the outcome of legal trials -decided by hand to hand combat, who gets a promotion at work-decided by hand to hand combat. When they go to war, they often use hand to hand tactics. 

Hand to hand combat usually doesn’t have a big role in SF. SF is all about laser guns and whatnot. But it might work. Perhaps the Klingons are like the  Xenomorphs in the Alien movies? Xenomorphs have incredible speed, armour, claws, teeth. Xenomorphs are more than a match for any blaster wielding humanoid. Sorry, Klingons are not like that.  They are just tough humanoids who still die to a single phaser shot. 

Perhaps Klingons have cool high tech melee weapons like chain swords, monofilament blades, or even light sabres? Nope. They use a traditional weapon that makes no sense at all!

Perhaps they have high tech armour, so they can at least get close to the enemies to use their old fashioned melee weapons. Think Dune! They had force field armour in Dune. Nope. Klingons had traditional armour that didn’t protect them for modern weapons. 

Maybe Klingons are weak individually but came in hordes. They came in overpowering numbers. You might shoot ten Klingons but the eleventh Klingon gets you. Nope. 

Klingons seem like a race that values something that is no longer important or useful when it comes to gaining power. 

But somehow we are told that this race is one of the most powerful in the galaxy?

3,What is your biggest Star Trek pet peeve?,1599299975,"I have two main pet peeves about Star Trek and while I'd like to know your own take on them, I'd rather read your own.

The first one is that 9 times out of 10, non-Terran species and non-Federation civilisations are warrior cultures who really like honour. ""We are a race of warriors captain!"" ""We value our honour!"" ""You Federation types are so soft! We are warriors! We are a war-like people!"" ""Honour! We have lots of it! Want some honour?!""

Like, when Starfleet makes first contact with a civilisation and finds YET AGAIN they are a warrior culture who shoot honour up their arms, they must eye roll heard and let out a big sigh ""ugh not another one. What else is new?""

My second one is the apparent fragility of Starfleet's ships. Like, the Federation is supposed to be a galactic superpower with some of the most advanced weaponry and defense systems in the Milky Way. YET, when they come into contact with an equal foe (Klingons, Romulans etc.) or even a 2nd tier or 3r tier power...

*Alien ship fires one shot at Enterprise*

*Worf: Shields down to 70%!*

*Alien ship fires second shot*

*Enterprise bridge starts exploding*

*Worf: Shields down to 20%!*

*Picard: Captains to engineering! Status report!*

*LaForge: There's a plasma leak in the main warp core conduits sir! The Enterprise won't survive another shot!*

Essentially, if you give machines sentience, you have have to give them the rights equivalent to biologically sentient life.  This paradigm shift would crash the economy if the technology was adopted enough. Therefore, the most ethical solution would be to deny machines the sentience that would then require them rights.

There is an ongoing storyline, and plenty of engaging roleplays where you can go on missions of science or battle, peace or war! There is a fun and engaging ship combat and flight system, and it's full of great people.

The staff team is helpful, and Picard in particular is a lifesaver. You start on the Enterprise, but can either choose to stay there and rank up, potentially taking a **Senior Staff** role, or you could transfer to another ship! You could even roleplay as the evil Romulans and fight against the Federation! The gamemasters work day and night to create expansive and engaging roleplay events.

But damn Capt Janeway was the fucking worst starfleet captain. She was next level inconsistent, and bent or adhered to the rules depending on HOW she felt about it.

Sure enough her inconsistency is what gave us 7 years of Voyager. For had she not decided to disregard the prime directive, they'd have used the array to get back home. 

That's fine. But then a few weeks/episodes later, they find a civilization with the technology to send them 50,000 light years closer to earth, and that's when she decides to uphold the almighty prime directive. Yeah. Her crew went behind her back and it ended up not working, but she still showed that how she felt/her emotion ruled supreme. And that was evident throughout the series.

Remember the episode where they found Q locked in an asteroid and the other Q bribed her with return to earth if she ruled in his favor? She refused. Her crew didn't know about that conversation. 

She showed numerous times that she was willing to put the lives and well-being of other species and crews before her crew. And as a veteran, that really rubs me the wrong way. I don't know ANY commander that would show his or her troops that their well-being comes second to others

And when Kate Mulgrew came on, she was an established actress and had the power to decide the direction of the show. She had a significant say in the series, so I credit her for part of the story.

Rewatching both seasons to refresh my memory ahead of season 3. Some things are much better than I remember from the first time around, others are worse.  


**The good:**  


The Klingons -  yes they look different but I actually really like the way they start of as a shattered empire of multiple warring clans. It would be really cool to see how they got to that point. My had canon is that all the different houses separated from each other after the events of Enterprise in order to maintain their racial purity. By not mixing with other houses they were not at risk of spreading the augment DNA which had infected the Klingons in Enterprise. This had the effect of resulting in a degree of inbreeding which is accounts for their more extreme look (yes this is only my headcannon but I think it sits nicely in the existing lore).  


The interactions between the crew - Some of the scenes and dialogue between the main cast members are really well done. The characters immediately feel more fleshed out and real than in the early episodes of the other series  


The concept: An experimental ship developing top secret tech to win a war is a seriously great direction for Trek to take. I admit the spore drive was a bit ""out there"" even by Trek standards and it's a shame they got too caught up in the specifics of it because they really had the potential to mix the best of DS9 and TNG with the basic premise of the series.  


**The bad:**

&amp;#x200B;

The Starfleet justice system - It makes absolutely no sense how Michael was sentenced to life imprisonment and blamed for starting the war.  Yes she briefly mutinied and assaulted her captain and that should be punished for that but she was in no way responsible for starting the war. The Klingons entered Federation space and fired the first shots. The fact the Capt Georgiou eventually came to see that Michael was right and agreed with her plan to try and capture T'kuvma partially vindicates her and the fact that members of the Shenzhou crew witnessed this yet none of them spoke up for her at her trial and those who went on to serve on the Discovery apparently still resent her for something which they saw was not her fault just seems like they had to trim some important exposition from the script to get to that point. Likewise the trial itself seemed a bit clandestine with the Starfleet judges sitting hidden in the shadows passing judgement as if trying to intimidate and interrogate the accused rather than simply trying to get to the facts of the case, just doesn't seem like something that would happen in the Federation, heck even the Klingon and Cardassian trials we have seen didn't resort to such tactics.  


The spore drive: I have no problem with them developing an experimental propulsion drive that allows them to teleport around the galaxy but the way they explain how it works and the whole Physics = biology bit seems a bit too fantastical even by Trek standards.

65,"Who else remembers watching DS9's ""In the Pale Moonlight"" live as it aired?",1599230994,"I was a freshman in high school, 14 years old when that episode aired. I remember going to my friends house who had a [bigger TV than mine](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/22/9b/27/229b27da61ac17ab1898505b31a915b4.jpg) to watch it.  We were both big Star Trek fans (the only Star Trek fans as far as I knew) and we were psyched for FINALLY a new episode that would advance the Dominion War arc after [seeing the trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-beH1eKKsw).

It may be hard to understand, but a running story line with MUST-SEE episodes was essentially unheard of in 1998. And of course nothing was on-demand, so it was a week of anticipation, which was absolutely electrifying.

I'm writing about this, because this episode in particular (along with 2 or 3 other DS9 and Voyager episodes, which I'll elaborate on if anyone is interested) has a vivid place in my memory, and I'm wondering if anyone else watched it live and experienced the same emotions I did.

Somehow, in the years since it's aired, the Senator Vreenak scene ""it's a faaaaake"" has become a minor meme.  But I VIVIDLY remember seeing it live, and my heart SANK when he said that.  I got that same feeling you get when you just got busted for something.  I thought WE were FUCKED. It went to commercial after that and I remember being like ""holy shit, what the fuck is going on?? The good guys are supposed to WIN"".

And I also remember hearing Vreenak died in the shuttle explosion and being like ""WTF?"" and when Garek admitted to killing him instantly, my friend and I were just awestuck that killing the Senator had been Garek's plan all along.  It was simply jaw dropping.

I've lived 22 years on this earth since that episode aired.  That's nearly twice as long as I was alive at the time it aired, and I still remember the feeling I felt when Sisko got busted in the ""it's a faaaake"" scene.  I legitimately thought the Dominion war was lost, and it was a wonderful time to be a Star Trek fan.

First off there's to many mono cultures, to many alien races are a bit to monochrome in how they are represented not enough chaos in their cultures to allow diverse clothing, styles, genders, races and political ideals. Ds9 did wonders for the cardassians, Klingons and ferengi but tng barely scratched the surface.

Secondly we have a federation with so many humans serving in starfleet where are the boleans and all the other countless races the enterprise only had 13 races represented on enterprise? Yet disco seems more diverse all I'm saying is martok saying that ""Klingons, humans, and romulans"" coming together was a momentous occasion hits harder cause martok says it like he's acknowledging humanity as the head of the federation.

Lastly were are all the half humans, or other half aliens there's no way we don't have half vulcan/half Klingons out there.

All I'm saying the next star trek series should have a half human as the captain and not just half human/vulcan/Klingon but something more exotic.

I'd like to see peter Dinklage play a half human half tellerite as captain of the enterprise with an mostly alien crew and have the alien cultures explored more deeply and explore what it means to be alive and not just pursuing the human dilemma but the question of examining all life and this series can have aliens from every series ent, voy, disco, tng, etc...",startrek,deadrail,False,/r/startrek/comments/imajh3/theres_one_little_thing_that_still_bothers_me/

I was like 11 when TNG started and when Denise Crosby got killed off in season one, even though I didn’t know anything about any of it but I sensed it was abrupt.  So when she reappears in the episode I remember it being a real TV thrill.  Then Shooter McGavin hits on her 😘

Guinan is an amazing catalyst for the episode, basically in this alternate timeline where Picard is a hardened battle commander she’s almost his mystic.  When she first tells him everything is wrong he takes it deadly seriously even without a single fact.  

But Picard’s greatnesses is full on display.  He collects the series of events for how the Enterprise-C came to the future and instantly understood the potential impact of restoring the timeline.  Then the senior staff thinks he’s batshit when he tells him his plan to send C back in time on a suicide mission but he talks them down and leads them, period.

It’s nice meeting Rachel Garret and the Ambassador, wish we could have seen much more of it in later Treks.

Personally, I find it hard to pin down why everything just feels so flat and uninteresting, for the most part.

For contrast, I remember seeing Rogue One in 2016, and absolutely loving the shots of the Death Star, The Destroyers, and all the fighters. even that movie's effects felt more ""alive"" than that of Solo and the Main Trilogy. 

Maybe, for the future, they should move back to having more matte/weathered metal feel of past series' rather than the slick, almost oily-shine looking textures they've been using as of late?

-	Reusing Extras — Probably most evident in Temporal Edict with the same alien ‘extras’ appearing both on the Cerritos and simultaneously on the crystal planet.
-	Still shots of the Cerritos — Filming a physical model was expensive and time consuming in the analog era, so ~~sometimes~~ often the production team would cheat by doing some Ken Burns zoom in on a prerendered photo of the ship in question.

Also, weird thing I’ve observed: aside from the Cerritos itself… there’s like… no CGI in the title sequence. Or at least, none that I can say “AH-HA! Spotted the CGI model”

25,"The hatred of ""technobabble"" many people on this forum have is pretty mystifying to me",1599158603,"What is derided here as ""technobabble"" (I hate that word, honestly) is what makes Star Trek what it is on a very fundamental level. If you ignore everything and purely focus on what is going on around the characters in Star Trek, you will conclude that Star Trek has far more magic than even Star Wars, a setting where space wizards run around with laser swords. Nothing in Star Wars is nowhere nearly as outrageous as things that regularly happen on Star Trek. But why is Trek not a fantasy like Star Wars even though it has far more magic? It's all a matter of MINDSET and how the writers approach the SETTING itself. Characters in Star Trek refuse to accept magic as magic. To them, magic is just yet unexplained science! That's where ""technobabble"" comes in - in a more objective narrative sense, it's what covers up the magic, but when it comes to themes, it represents the persisting claim that humanity is not at the mercy of unknowable forces, eldritch abominations, and cosmic horrors. No, we can take control of our own destiny, we can learn and figure out how the universe works, and even when a literal space god shows up, we can look him in the eye and say that all he's doing are very sophisticated tricks stemming from his knowledge of reality. There is even an entire episode of TNG where Picard and his crew do exactly that to an imposter who was pretending to be a god.

That is why for example I adore Voyager's ""technobabble"" and I adore watching Janeway and B'Elanna geeking out over a problem, because of what it represents. It represents two intelligent scientists, who also happen to be women, working very hard to get their crew out of problems by relying on the ideological core of Star Trek - a belief that science, technology and human progress can, do and will go hand in hand, until we establish and maintain a heaven for ourselves. Voyager is the exact show that should have been filled with ""technobabble"", and it's the show where I felt that ""technobabble"" was powerful and most thematically relevant.",startrek,persistentInquiry,False,/r/startrek/comments/ilzfj9/the_hatred_of_technobabble_many_people_on_this/

27,"All Good Things was such a great, emotionally fitting finale for the The Next Generation...",1599158021,"Hey everyone, you may remember my [surprisingly highly-upvoted post back from when I finished The Undiscovered Country and finished the Captain Kirk era of Star Trek](https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/g0wzfm/watching_star_trek_for_the_first_time_the/). 

Well, I'm back with an update on my first-time viewing of all of Star Trek, and after a little over four months of binging The Next Generation, I just watched *All Good Things* last night. 

On its surface, the story is about three different generations of the U.S.S. Enterprise coming together across space and time to break down a temporal anomaly that threatens to destroy humanity. But on a deeper level, it's really a story about Picard learning the true value of the bonds and friendships he's formed with his crew over the past seven years he spent as captain, and the story was really cleverly written to reflect that message. 

The storyline with Picard being shifted to the possible future and seeing how everyone turned out...bummed me the fuck out. Deanna's dead, Will and Worf have had a falling out, Jean-Luc and Beverly are divorced, Worf is now a disgraced politician within the Klingon Empire, the Federation and the Klingons are enemies again, and Picard and Riker don't seem to be on good terms either. It was a future where everything had gone wrong and the crew went their separate ways, their friendships with each other having seemingly died out. It was a stark contrast with the present day. 

The past also served as a good contrast, with Picard realizing that in this timeframe he has not established his relationship with the crew yet, and alienating them because they all think their new captain is acting like a weirdo. It was, however, great to see how socially awkward this Data was with O'Brien's ""midnight oil"" joke, reminding us about just how far my boy has come in his quest to become more ""human"" (Not that Data still isn't a little awkward, but he's come a long way). It was really interesting to see the story unfold, with Picard in the past having to convince his new crew that their captain wasn't going mad, Picard in the present day with him and his crew at their prime, and Picard in the future trying to convince his estranged friends that he isn't going senile as a result of his illness. 

Picard seeing his crew in the past and in the future where they've all been estranged really helped him see the value of the friendships he had built with them in the present day. You can imagine my relief when the shitty possible future Picard saw turned out to be just that...a *possible* future, not one that was set in stone. Picard finally joining the rest of the crew at the poker table and having his epiphany that he ""should've done this a long time ago"" got me a little teary-eyed, and to end the series with the crew vowing that they will not allow that possible future to pass, and Picard declaring that ""the sky's the limit"" was an amazing way to end a bright-eyed, optimistic show like TNG.

___

**Episode 5 - ""Cupid's Errant Arrow""**

* The episode has no cold open. Other than the Short Treks, I believe this is the first episode to begin with the opening title sequence since ""Encounter at Farpoint.""
* The damaged moon of Mixtus III evokes the aftermath of Praxis, the doomed Klingon moon in *The Undiscovered Country.*
* An unstable moon was the problem of the week in ""Deja Q.""
* Boimler insists Barb is as real as ""a hopped-up Q on Captain Picard Day."" Q would have indeed been hopped up had he seen Captain Picard Day, a celebration initiated by the *Enterprise* schoolchildren in ""The Pegasus."" CPD is observed in real life by fans on multiple days each year.
* Rutherford and Tendi must deal with a plasma fire. A plasma fire - it's like a fire, but green - threatened to destroy the cargo bay in ""Disaster"" and engineering in ""Investigations.""
* The shuttles on the Vancouver (Marpole, Fairview, Kitsilani) are named after neighborhoods of that city. Vancouver is one of Trek's studio filming locations but has not been mentioned on screen before.
* Boimler enters the shuttlebay holding a teddy bear dressed like Geordi La Forge. This may be a reference to Geordi's famous success with women, completely the opposite of Boimler's struggles here.
* I don't doubt for a second that Boimler's flowers are a callback, but someone else can identify them, I have to go to work.
* Mariner suggests Boimler date the ""Phylosian in tactical."" The Phylosians were the plant people introduced in ""The Infinite Vulcan.""
* Barb recalls a mission involving ""1920s Chicago."" A planet modelling their society after this era was featured in ""A Piece of the Action.""
* Boimler describes Jet as a ""Kirk sundae with Trip Tucker sprinkles."" I don't know who Kirk was, but Charles Tucker III was the chief engineer of the NX-01 *Enterprise* and carried enough machismo to woo a Vulcan. He is alive and well and living in Tallahassee.
* Among Mariner's hypothesized identities for Barb:
 * a Romulan spy - Ambassador T'Pel turned out to be one in ""Data's Day""
 * a salt succubus - this was the creature on M113 in ""The Man Trap""
 * an android - many androids have been seen in the franchise, though perhaps the one with the biggest ""surprise factor"" was Juliana Tainer in ""Inheritance""
 * a Changeling - let's pick, oh, I dunno, Martia.
 * ""one of those sexy people in rompers who murders you for going on the grass"" - describing the Edo people of ""Justice."" Or maybe the Pakleds.
* The *Quito* appears to be an Olympic-class starship like the *Pasteur* in ""All Good Things.""
* The *Quito* is docked at what is presumably Deep Space 9, the Cardassian-designed space station guarding the Bajoran wormhole.
* The crew of the *Quito* are sporting the grey uniforms of DS9 and the TNG films, placing this flashback somewhere between 2373 and 2379.
* The gossip of the day involves Data's evil twin brother teaming up with the Borg. This is a description of the plot of ""Descent,"" where Lore finds a group of Borg ravaged by Hugh's individuality. This episode occurred in 2369 or 2370 (or both), so Mariner's friend might need to refresh her twitter feed.
* Mariner remarks that ""it's a new thing every week with those guys,"" something the *Enterprise* crew had to have noticed by that point.
* Freeman explains to the Mixtians that their ancestral homes will be moved to the sixth moon, which ""will technically be the fifth moon anyway."" A similar confusion occurred with the planets of the Ceti Alpha system in *Wrath of Khan.*
* Mariner creates a conspiracy board which contains the following items:
 * a red-eyed monstrous creature she describes as a ""dauphin,"" which is more accurately one of the forms assumed by the allasomorph in ""The Dauphin""
 * a ""surgically altered Cardassian spy,"" which is what Kira was claimed to be in ""Second Skin""
 * a ""transporter clone"" - examples include ""The Enemy Within"" and ""Second Chances""
 * a Suliban, the chameleonesque Temporal Cold War agents in ENT
 * a Romulan female, perhaps another callback to ""Data's Day"" but possibly a reference to Troi's posing as a Romulan in ""Face of the Enemy"" (or just, you know, Romulans are sneaky)
 * the featureless prototype version of Lal from ""The Offspring""
 * a pair of Bynars, the collectively-linked little dudes in ""11001001""
 * a humpback whale, which is referencing when Scotty turns out to be a whale spy in *The Voyage Home*
 * a Vendorian, already referenced in ""Envoys""
 * two Klingon females who share, um, ""features"" in common with the Duras Sisters
 * what appears to be a Sasquatch
 * a mean-looking green guy with a mohawk-like fin on his head. It is not a Xindi or an Aquan. Help.
* Part of Boimler's ""cool guy"" outfit is what looks like a Starfleet letter jacket, presumably from the Academy. Although we've never seen this before, it will hopefully be on sale soon in the CBS store.
* When Boimler spills beer on Barb he sputters ""oh, no, no, oh no"" in the same way Sonya Gomez does when she spills hot chocolate on Picard in ""Q Who.""
* Shout-out to u/T656 who *finally* [recognized](https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/ijwrrj/same_species/) the blue floppy-eared background aliens seen in multiple episodes: one was seen on Rura Penthe in *The Undiscovered Country.*
* Mariner attempts an emergency transport, a tactic frequently used in the TNG era. Most of the time it just ""happens,"" but this is the first time someone on the other end of the line has *refused* to do it.
* She then grabs an EVA suit and jumps between ships, something done in *Nemesis,* *Into Darkness* and ""The Vulcan Hello.""
* Rather than give us Trek's first full-frontal male nudity, this episode instead gives us Trek's first visual censorship.
* The Mixtian appeals to the Prime Directive, the famous General Order One clause that prevents Starfleet from interfering in other cultures. Freeman claims it ""doesn't apply here,"" although it kinda sorta seems like it *should*...perhaps itself a reference to the shaky, malleable, impossibly complex nature of the Prime Directive.
* Barb suspects Mariner is a ""rogue holodeck character,"" evoking Moriarty, or perhaps Chaotica, or given the context, Minuet, or most likely that sneaky little shit Flotter.
* Her other guess was ""a Breen infiltrator."" The Breen were the mysterious mercenaries who ran around in refrigerated bounty hunter suits and joined up with the Dominion during the war.
* It is revealed that there are only two Mixtians on the endangered planet, reminiscent of the situation in ""The Survivors."" Freeman immediately orders the moon destroyed, in an explicit demonstration of the axiom ""the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few (or the two).""
* Docent's password is ""Riker,"" a reference to the fat jowly guy in ""These are the Voyages.""
* Docent bemoans having to calibrate a Dyson sphere. In the twentieth century a physicist called Freeman Dyson postulated the theory that an enormous hollow sphere could be constructed around a star. This would have the advantage of harnessing all the radiant energy of that star. A population living on the interior surface would have virtually inexhaustible sources of power. A Dyson sphere (or was it a Dyson shell) was featured in ""Relics.""
* Under the viewscreen/viewport of the orbital ship is one of those status bars with the lights that pulse inward. You know the ones.
* Boimler is infected with a neural parasite. The most famous of these were the brainwashing sluggy creatures in ""Conspiracy."" Thankfully Mariner is able to remove this parasite in a somewhat cleaner manner.",startrek,Antithesys,False,/r/startrek/comments/iltjal/canon_references_cupids_errant_arrow_spoilers/

Recently, when Star Trek: Lower Decks came out I realized it took place after TNG, so I can’t wait to finish TNG. Either way, I started watching Lower Decks and think it’s hilarious and awesome, was sad when I hit episode 4 and realized I had to wait for the next episode.

So... was just now watching TNG, on season 7 now, and noticed this episode was a lot like Star Trek: Lower Decks; the story was centered around the Ensigns and their point of view of being on a starship.

DS9 - Sisko and Dukat are both middle aged. As is Winn. The youth (Jake, Nog, Ziyal) are not as central to the story.

59,"Can I be honest, Jonathan Archer is the worst Star Fleet Captain I have ever laid eyes on",1599119559,"So I just finished Cogenitor which is Season 2 episode 22 of Star Trek Enterprise and if I’m being honest I’m hesitant to continue watching this so called “captain” make terrible decision after terrible decision. I’ve thought some of his choices were questionable in the past but this, this was the dumbest shit ever. So for those of you who don’t know, the starship Enterprise encounters the Vissians who have a third gender that is basically a surrogate for the child. This surrogate is basically a slave who after having a child for one couple is given to another, and so on. Trip decided to take it upon himself to teach the Vissian how to read and show her some movies. Eventually he brings her over to the Enterprise and he convinces her to request political asylum. Captain Archer (who got this job because of nepotism apparently) was on a three day survey by himself with an alien he just met which isn’t that bad but once he gets back and finds out the situation with Trip he goes bananas. He argues with the Vissian captain and engineer about how they describe their Cogenitor as an object and that asylum must be taken very seriously, I would understand if they had threatened the ship and he was forced to return the surrogate but he does it solely to keep good relations. Another thing is when Trip says he tried to help free a slave because he thought “its what the captain would’ve done” the captain lays into him about how he must be setting a bad example if he thinks that freeing a slave is the right thing to do? He then says it was the right thing if they were in Singapore or Florida but not out in space. Even though that’s exactly what he did when they encountered a Suliban prison camp and talked of the Japanese-Americans being in prison during WW2. After they get the message that the Cogenitor committed suicide Archer is like that’s one more person who would’ve been alive if we didn’t make first contact, like that’s all you have to say, if I was Trip I would’ve asked for permission to speak freely then asked the captain if only he is allowed to selectively enforce human morals when they’re away from earth. He tells trip that her blood is on his hands because he taught her how to read and she realized how terrible her existence was and decided to end it, the parallels to slaves during the American 1700, and 1800s is obvious. In my opinion the blood was on captain Archers hands not on Trips, he bemoans that the couple will now have to wait “a long while” before they can get a new slave for them to breed with. “Maybe this will teach you a lesson” what lesson is that, that if I teach a subjugated part of an alien population basic reading skills she will comprehend how awful her existence is and commit suicide and no longer breed for her masters? Maybe there’s an argument to be made that we can teach them some of our values through interacting with them but they never make it and this society is already far more advanced than we are, but they never make it. There are some other extremely questionable choices he has made, like in episode 8 of season 2 when Malcolm lost his communicator on a pre warp planet. Instead of cutting his losses and letting them think the device is some technology that belongs to a rival faction they go down there to retrieve it and get kidnapped and lose a bunch of their phasers and shit, then these poor aliens see their captors just inside of what appears to be an invisible ship to escape, doing far more damage than just one device could’ve. He also yelled at Trip for getting impregnated by an alien when it was not his fault at all they just held hands in some sand. His racism towards the Vulcans is a bit much, to the point where he would rather endanger the lives of his crew than say ask them to use their tractor beam. His decision to bring Porthos(his dog) aboard was questionable at best. When the dog is sick it causes him to act irrationally and be rude to visiting aliens, but he reprimands Trip about respecting first contact which he just ignored. He lets his crew go camping on a planet with pollen that drives them insane, he doesn’t even send a team down to investigate before letting everyone go camping. To be honest this show has a lot of issues, like Caleb’s god awful acting, the unnecessary scenes in the decomp chamber, the theme song (which is starting to grow on me), and the constant retcons it does, they ran into the Ferengi apparently way before Picard did. after typing this post the episode is over and now the next one is starting and it’s about the Borg frozen in the Ice and it turns out that not only had Starfleet already encountered the borg, the starship Enterprise’s medic developed a cure for the borg nanoprobes they inject into people to assimilate them. This makes a lot of the borg plot in TNG pointless. Than in episode 25 T’Pol tells captain the Tellerite are dangerous and his only remark is to mention it to Trip before theyre shot. We also get another decomp chamber scene with T’Pol which is essential to the plot I’m sure. Overall this show is just so disappointing I’m not sure who thought this prequel was a good idea but they deserve to be shots I think this ranks firmly in last place for all Star Trek shows, live action, animated, and fan made. Out of all of them this one is by far the worst. By the time I finished typing this captain archer was kidnapped by a bounty hunter like the goddamn moron he is. Poor T’Pol, having to be second in command to him and here he tries to plead to the bounty hunters emotions by telling them he was helping a ship of refugees, even though it was in violation of Klingon law. Violating alien law for human morals is what he yelled at Trip for but only two episodes later he’s using it as a defense to an alien bounty hunter, probably without realizing his hypocrisy at all.",startrek,johnstark2,False,/r/startrek/comments/ilp8ay/can_i_be_honest_jonathan_archer_is_the_worst_star/
60,"So I just completed a rewatch of DS9 and then TNG, and naturally decided to reach Voyager next. I remembered technobabble being a Voyager weakness, but I didn't remember it being *that* bad from the start. The technobabble feels fundamentally different than the shows that preceded it.",1599117764,"Someone linked that 'some kind of...' compilation from Voyager a few days ago. I didn't realize that's literally like the third line spoken in the pilot. 

In the second or third episode, we get 'warp particles'. Warp particles are a thing I guess. Before it was always gravitons, a real-world theoretical particle that could bend space. 

I remember being annoyed by the technobabble in Voyager back when it aired. Too many plot solutions hinged on characters spouting gobbeltygook. I'm going to stick with my rewatch, but I gotta say, after going through TNG and DS9 recently, Voyager's casual abuse and overuse of technobabble is far worse than I remembered. 

Again this is coming straight off a DS9 and TNG rewatch first and then going straight into Voyager.

61,TNG: Relics,1599117598,"I recently watched Relics for the first time in a while. Although it is definitely a good episode, I noticed a few things that were rather out of character:

Geordi is generally a great people person (if you ignore his creepy attempts at romance). He generally makes everyone feel welcome. Data considered him his first true friend. Yet Geordi is downright rude to Scotty. I realize that Scotty was getting in the way, but still, I think Geordi would have been more diplomatic.

Is Scotty a living legend? I don't know, but from his treatment in this episode, I'd say not. The crew rarely makes references to the TOS crew, which is perfectly reasonable - I don't spend much time talking about people from 80 years ago. But when the names Kirk or Spock are mentioned, it's clear everyone in Starfleet knows those names. I understand that Scotty is probably a lot less famous, but he must be an important historical figure for an engineer, right? It just seemed weird that Picard is the only person to express a genuine interest in getting to know Scotty.

I realize the Dyson Sphere was just the B plot, but it still seemed rather unexplored. The plot basically went from: Wow - a Dyson Sphere! - Shit, now we're trapped and have to get out. - Ok, now we're out. Time for another adventure. I just would have expected a little more interest in trying to learn about who created it, and where they went, etc.

The final sendoff was a nice scene, but when you think about it bizarre. Here's an old man, feeling lonely and useless, and what do they do? They give him a tiny spaceship with limited range be alone in. I get it - they had to send him off into the wild blue yonder, in search of new adventure, but doing that alone in a shuttlecraft just seems weird.

I do have to say, I absolutely loved the callback line: ""It is green.""",startrek,JoeyJoeJoeJrShab,False,/r/startrek/comments/ilovas/tng_relics/

67,"Let's clear some stuff up: Trill hosts aren't trans in of themselves. An individual might be, but a host that takes on a symbiote that previously was carried by a host of a different gender doesn't make them trans. Also, Soren from TNG's ""The Outcast"" wasn't nb and neither was her species.",1599112456,"__Trill__

While a joined host will have memories from their previous hosts, that does not make them trans. Trill hosts are always their own person and there are multiple episodes where it is established that Trill are not their previous hosts. To our knowledge, the symbiote may or may not have gender.

__Soren and the J'naii__

The J'naii identify as androgenous or agender. This is not necessarily the same as being non-binary (nb) though someone who identifies as nb may also identify as agender. An incredibly simplified explanation is that on the spectrum of Male to Female, people who are nb will often say they exist somewhere in the middle of the two whereas someone who is agender will often say they are off the spectrum entirely.

Soren identified as woman until she was put through conversion therapy, brainwashed, and possibly mutilated. She was not agender until she was forced to be.

The claim that the two new characters are the first trans and nb characters is not incorrect. There has not yet been solid canonical representation of a trans masculine character nor a non-binary character.",startrek,Sophia_Forever,False,/r/startrek/comments/ilnvao/lets_clear_some_stuff_up_trill_hosts_arent_trans/

86,Star Trek Enterprise as first timer,1599087541,"I recently finished Star Trek Enterprise on Netflix as a first timer and I really liked the series!

As a kid I grew up with Voyager, The Next Generation and DS9 and have fond memories of those. Voyager is my favorite of all series btw. I've also seen most of the other series/movies but never seen Enterprise. I really wasn't very eager to start with Enterprise and when I did decide to try it, I almost abandoned ship and pretty much hated almost the entire crew. Malcom, Archer, Trip, T-pol etc. I just didn't find the characters and the actors appealing. Enterprise is supposedly the worst series but as I watched more and more of it, I started to enjoy it more and more and really grew on the crew. In fact, now that I've finished it, I feel like it was a fine crew and the actors did a pretty good job. Also, it's amazing how the Star Trek writers seem to be able to give the doctors on the different series such an unique and appealing personality. &gt;!It was pretty weird in the first part of the series to not have photon torpedo's (I didn't knew it was a prequel at first) but even cooler later when they were equipped with them (still no shields though :P ).!&lt; 

I got to admit, now that I've finished the series, I feel a bit empty and really miss the crew and their adventures (just as with some other reruns I did :P ). It was pretty disappointing to have Enterprise finish so abruptly :( One thing that surprised me a bit though is that at one point in the series !&gt;they had to make the impossible decision to either give up an important, live saving mission or pillage some warp parts from an alien freighter in distress and they eventually went through with stealing the parts leaving the freighter with only impulse engines. I was expecting the series to either have a reference in a later episode in where they sent another Starfleet vessel to the alien freighter to make things right or something, or go out for them themselves but that never happened!&lt;. Pretty ackward and I wish the writers of Enterprise did make it right somehow.

Either way, very enjoyable series and too bad it ended so abruptly.",startrek,Tech94,False,/r/startrek/comments/ilhmt7/star_trek_enterprise_as_first_timer/

13,All Visuals Are Canon,1599057773,"I’m that one person who thinks discovery and tos are BOTH visually canon AND in the same timeline. The explanation is simple. We instead have to accept that the tech of TOS is actually more advanced and just has a different aesthetic than discovery. The TOS era ships still look the same. The discovery era ships still look the same. Ships undergo refits. In Star Trek, each decade in universe has a different aesthetic. Of course Discovery ships are going to look different than TOS ones. In fact, the Shenzhou is a 2240s ship and it has its own aesthetic because it is from the 2240s and not the 2250s. It’s the previous decade which would naturally have its own aesthetic, so the decade before TOS would also not have the same aesthetic as TOS. Think of how different the ships in TMP-2270s (and a few old ships from the 2270s that weren’t refit for some reason later movies) looked from TOS ships. It’s a new aesthetic. Also the USS Discovery is an experimental ship, so it’s has its own aesthetic which is somewhat different from most Starfleet ships at the time, which likely look more like the discovery enterprise internally. Also the only tech differences I can think of are the lack of holographic communications, holographic controls, and touchscreens. Perhaps starfleet decided to give up touchscreens and holographic controls because buttons are harder for AIs such as Control to hack. Star Trek ships change appearance drastically after being refit.

17,Project Defiant: DS9 1080p+ Upscale Now Available,1599055185,"TLDR: DS9 upscale is here. Skip all the way to the bottom for instructions on where to get it. We've opted to release it in 1080p+, where it's first upscaled to 4K and then compressed to 1080p in x265. Thanks for all of your feedback!

&amp;#x200B;

Mods, please let me know if you feel this is inappropriate for the sub.

&amp;#x200B;

Seasons 3-7 are ready and looking great! We listened to your feedback from our previous work and opted to release these seasons in 1080p+, minimizing the file size while maintaining  a visual quality comparable to the raw 4K files.

&amp;#x200B;

A few key differences when compared to our Seasons 1 &amp; 2 releases:

* 1080p+ x265 MKV instead of 4K or 1080p MP4 file container. For this process we first upscale to 4K and then compress to 1080p in x265, which results in a nearly indistinguishable visual quality when compared to the raw 4K.
*  Better overall upscaling results (as we said in the seasons 1 &amp; 2 posts, the earlier seasons don't take to the upscale as well as the latter ones do)
*  We re-added the subtitles! Our release is now in MKV format for this purpose.
*  We've been seeding the file for a while before making the announcement, so downloads should be faster
* Most seasons are now in the original stereo audio.

&amp;#x200B;

Project Details:

&amp;#x200B;

Lately there has been a lot of talk about upscaling DS9. There are many people working all over the globe to accomplish this, each trying their own methods and sources.

Much like its namesake, Project Defiant is the imperfect, but sturdy, approach to the problem. We have directly upscaled all of DS9 from MKV source files. The result isn't as perfect as some of the other approaches, but it's quick and available en-masse.

Don't expect the quality to be equal to that of a native remaster, but it's a huge step up from the originals. Also, audio synchronization is sometimes imperfect; this is due to the fact that the original source has a variable framerate that was common in 90's TV shows and had to be converted to constant framerate (CFR) prior to the upscaling.

We sampled episodes from each season, and noticed that seasons 1 &amp; 2 don't play as nicely with the upscale as the latter seasons.

&amp;#x200B;

Technical details:

We're using Topaz Labs' Gigapixel AI for video (currently available for free in Beta). This upscales the video without cropping, which makes everything take longer, but at least no information is lost. We now post-process every episode in H265 using HandBrake to minimize the file size and maintain aspect-ratio. Each episode is between 500 Mb and 1 GB. The difference in file size between some episodes is due to the processing time dedicated to compressing the file in H265.

&amp;#x200B;

If you want to upscale something yourself:

We've created an upscale guide ([found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/il75yt/project_defiants_gigapixel_ai_for_video_upscale/)) to help take you through the steps of using Gigapixel AI for Video. With this guide you should be able to upscale pretty much anything you want at home, though keep in mind that the settings shared are optimized for DS9. Minimum requirements for upscaling: Windows 10, GTX 1080 GPU, 8 GB of RAM. Unfortunately Topaz Lab's software doesn't yet support AMD GPU's, so it's NVIDIA or bust! Each episode can take around of 10 hours to process, depending on your computer, so make sure that the conversion process won't cause you any problems or get in the way of other things you need to do on the computer.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

How to get it:

This is the tricky part. DS9 is the property of CBS, and we want you to show them how much you love it; so please buy the DVDs from a retailer before proceeding, only then will they consider doing a full remaster. You should never download any media that you don't already own. Furthermore, downloading anything from the internet can pose a great risk to you and should never be done without a VPN and antivirus. With that being said, the upscale is available on a specific public torrent site. I won't mention which one publicly, as I don't wish to break any rules here. It is possible to find it on Google by searching ""Star Trek Deep Space 9 S## AI Upscale 1080p+ (2020)"" (quotation marks included, but replace ## with the season number. ie S07). You may contact me privately for more information.",startrek,Cpt_Jay216,False,/r/startrek/comments/il7aju/project_defiant_ds9_1080p_upscale_now_available/

&amp;#x200B;

This guide is a work in progress. All feedback is welcome.

&amp;#x200B;

Software requirements:

	Gigapixel AI for Video (Beta)

		[https://videoai.topazlabs.com/beta](https://videoai.topazlabs.com/beta)

	Handbrake

		[https://handbrake.fr/](https://handbrake.fr/)

&amp;#x200B;

Hardware requirements:

	GPU:	GTX 1080 or better (must be Nvidia)

	CPU:	Ryzen 3 / Intel i3 or better

	RAM:	8 GB or more

	

\------------------------------------------------------------------

\---------------------Constant Framerate Guide---------------------

\------------------------------------------------------------------

	1- Start with whichever episode you wish you convert in MKV

		format.

&amp;#x200B;

	2. In Handbrake, go to ""Tools"" &gt; ""Preferences"" &gt; ""Output Files"".

		Near the bottom, next to ""MP4 File Extension"", 

		Select ""Always use MP4""

&amp;#x200B;

	3- Drag and drop the video you wish to convert into Handbrake

	

	4- Select the following settings:

		Preset: HQ 480p30 Surround

		

		Summary tab:

			format:			mp4

			Check ""Align A/V Start""

			

		Video tab:

			Video Codec: 		H.264(x264)

			Framerate (FPS):	30

			Check ""Constant Framerate""

			Encoder Preset:		Slower (third from right)

		

		Audio tab:

			Mixdown:	5.1 Channels

			Bitrate:	448

			

		Save as:	""DS9 s00e00 TITLE- CFR.mp4""

			Replacing the 00 with the correct season and episode

			number, and TITLE with the correct episode name.

	

	5- Click on the green ""Start Encode"" button at the top.

	

	The processing time per episode will be	\~30 min, and will

	use as much of your CPU as possible. This slows down the

	computer significantly. So only do this when the computer

	won't be used. You can also choose to do many of these

	conversions together overnight.

&amp;#x200B;

\------------------------------------------------------------------

\--------------------------Upscale Guide---------------------------

\------------------------------------------------------------------

	1- Install Gigapixel AI for Video from this link: 

		[https://videoai.topazlabs.com/beta](https://videoai.topazlabs.com/beta)

		

	2- Open a command window:

		2.a Press  Windows\_Key + R

		2.b type ""cmd"" (no quotes) and press OK

		2.c ALTERNATE: In the Windows search bar, type ""CMD""

			and open the ""Command Prompt""

	

	3- Type the following code (choose one depending on resolution):

			A. For 1080p upscale

videosrcmd.exe ""inputVideoPath"" -w 1584 -h 1080

			B. For 4K upscale

videosrcmd.exe ""inputVideoPath"" -w 3168 -h 2160



		Here, inputVideoPath will be the location of the video you

		wish to upscale. For example:

			videosrcmd.exe ""C:\\Users\\Me\\Desktop\\DS9 s06e06 Sacrifice of Angels- CFR.mp4"" -w 3168 -h 2160

		

		Documentation for this code can be found here:

			[https://topazlabs.s3.amazonaws.com/packages/win/topazgigapixelai\_video\_cmdline/help.html](https://topazlabs.s3.amazonaws.com/packages/win/topazgigapixelai_video_cmdline/help.html)

		

		Note that for Star Trek DS9, the width will always have the

		following formula:

			Width = Height x (4.4 / 3)

	

	The process will take \~8 hours for 1080p and \~19 hours for

	4K, depending on your GPU. This will not generally slow down 

	the computer, so you may continue to use it for anything that's

	not GPU-intensive.

	

	The output video file name should be of the format:

		DS9 s00e00 TITLE- CFR\_x2.22.mp4

	where x2.22 is the upscale factor and may be different.

&amp;#x200B;

\------------------------------------------------------------------

\----------------1080p H.265 Post-processing Guide-----------------

\------------------------------------------------------------------

	In our case, post processing with H.265 allows us to minimize 

	the file size without losing any quality whatsoever.

	

	1- Drag and drop the upscaled video you wish to process into

		Handbrake.

	

	2- Select the following settings:

		Preset: HQ 1080p30 Surround

		

		Summary tab:

			format:			mp4

			Check ""Align A/V Start""

		

		Dimensions tab:

			Anamorphic: Custom

			Uncheck ""Keep Aspect Ratio"" (next to 'Height' box)

			Width: 	1584

			Height:	1080

			(Don't touch ""Display Width"")

			PAR:	10	x	11

or

3	x	4

\*Display Width should automatically adjust to 

1440. Choose the PAR that yields this result.

\*\*Under ""Output"" (beneath PAR), the text should

read:

""Display Size: 1440x1080, PAR 10x11""

or

""Display Size: 1440x1080, PAR 3x4""

depending on the selected PAR. In either case,

the size should be 1440x1080.

		

		Video tab:

			Video Codec: 		H.265(x265)

			Framerate (FPS):	30

			Encoder Preset:		Fast

		

		Audio tab:

			Mixdown:	5.1 Channels

			Bitrate:	448

			

		Save as:	""DS9 s00e00 TITLE- CFR\_x2.22- H265.mp4""

			Replacing the 00 with the correct season and episode

			number, TITLE with the correct episode name, and 2.22

			with the correct upscale factor.

	

	3- Click on the green ""Start Encode"" button at the top.

&amp;#x200B;

	The processing time per episode will be	\~30 minutes if the

	source is 1080p, and \~2 hours if it's 4K. The process will

Star Trek TNG Opening Monologue

Original:

Space: the final frontier. These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission: to explore strange new worlds. To seek out new life and new civilizations. To boldly go where no one has gone before!

Translation:

宇宙：终极的边疆。这是星船企业号的航程。它的不断任务：探索奇怪新星球。寻找新异物和新文明。勇敢地去人类前所未去的地方！

&amp;#x200B;

Borg Introduction

Original:

We are the Borg. Lower your shields and surrender your ships. We will add your biological and technological distinctiveness to our own. Your culture will adapt to service us. Resistance is futile.

Translation:

我们是伯格。关闭你们的掩护和交出你们的星船。我们会把你们的生物（独特性）和技术独特性加入到我们自己的。你们的文化为了服务我们将适应。抵抗是没有意义的。

Sisko’s *In The Pale Moonlight* Ending Monologue

Original:

“At 08:00 hours station time, the Romulan Empire formally declared war against the Dominion. They have already struck 15 bases along the Cardassian border. So, this is a huge victory for the good guys! This may even be the turning point of the entire war! There is even a welcome to the fight party tonight in the wardroom. So… I lied, I cheated, I bribed men to cover the crimes of other men. I am an accessory to murder. But the most damning thing of all… I think I can live with it, and if I had to do it all over again, I would. Garak was right about one thing: a guilty conscience is a small price to pay for the safety of the Alpha Quadrant, so I will learn to live with it. Because I can live with it. I can live with it. Computer, erase that entire personal log.”

Translation:

“太空站时间，早上八点，罗慕兰帝国向自治同盟正式宣战。他们已经攻击了十五个在卡达西呀边境的基地。所以这是好人的重大胜利！这可能是整个战争的转折点！今晚在军官室甚至有“欢迎参战”的派对。所以… 我撒了谎，我骗了，我收买了人掩盖别人的罪行。我是谋杀案的帮凶。但最该死的一件事… 我觉得自己可以应付一切，而且如果需要再一次做，我就会做。加啦克(Garak)对一件事是正确的：问心有愧至于第一象限的安全真是小小的价格，所以我会习惯应付一切。因为我能应付一切。我能应付。电脑，消除全部的私人日志。”

Picard’s speech to Wesley about truth

Original:

“You even sat in my chair. I was annoyed. Presumptuous child playing on my ship. But I never forgot how you already knew every control, every display. You behaved as though you belonged on the Bridge.

And then later when I decided to make you an acting ensign, I was convinced you could be an outstanding officer. I’ve never questioned that conviction, until now.

The first duty of every Starfleet officer is to the truth. Whether it’s scientific truth, or historical truth, or personal truth. It is the guiding principle upon which Starfleet is based. If you can’t find it within yourself to stand up and tell the truth about what happened you don’t deserve to wear that uniform.

I’m going to make this simple for you, Mr. Crusher. Either you come forward and tell Admiral Brand what really took place, or I will.”

Translation:

“你甚至在我的椅子上坐了。我烦了。非分的孩子玩儿在我的星船。但我从来没忘记你已经知道每个的电钮、每台显示屏。你的举止好想你属于舰桥。

然后，当我决定让你成为代理少尉时，我相信你可以成为一名优秀的军官。到现在我从来没怀疑那个信仰。

每名星际舰队军官的主要职责是维护真里。无论是科学真理、历史真理、还是个人真理。真理是星际舰队所依据的指导原则。如果你不可以起来，说出真相，你就不值得穿那套制服。

克鲁瑟先生(Mr. Crusher)，我将为你简化这一过程。要么你挺身而出，告诉布兰度上将(Admiral Brand)真正发生的事情，要么我会的。”",startrek,MyCatIsASandwich,False,/r/startrek/comments/il5k0g/i_translated_some_of_the_best_star_trek/

I don't understand what the thinking is at all? We've gotten a one minute teaser trailer, which was literally almost 11 months ago now...and that's it. We haven't gotten anything else since, no new images, no cast interviews, no new casting info, **nothing**.  I mean think about it, they have been introduced to one new cast member, David Ajala, and that's literally been it. Since the show now takes place in an entire new century I expect tons of new characters/actors this season and yet not a word on any of them yet. 

But I was sure we were getting a big new trailer by the time Lower Decks premiered, when people were paying attention again. I don't get why there is so much secrecy?? I know this isn't the old days but believe it or not Star Trek wasn't this cloaked in  every season. In fact in the TNG days the producers and writers would tell us entire episodes and plot lines we would see before the season started. Now, it's like you can't even mention the names of the episode titles because that might give too much away. I think the mystery box thing is really getting out of hand these days, especially since all the secrets they keep hasn't really done them a lot of good from Khan to Voq, but I digress.

Anyway, its just odd. It premieres in 6 weeks now and you would think the marketing would be in full gear now? Especially since its been off more than a year. With the other seasons and Picard, we knew quite a bit about those seasons and we had the final trailer aired before 2 months.

51,And then Worf came along: the story of being the Enterprise’s actual tactical officer during First Contact,1599003830,"One thing that bugs me about the Battle of Sector 001 now, is that even though the sphere obviously shoots out and Picard orders a pursuit course, he then turns around to joke around with Riker and Worf.

https://youtu.be/D7KCb-O20Fg?t=4m06s

So I imagined how a disgruntled Lt. Daniels would tell his story on Lower Decks.

—

“So there I am at tactical, still a bit in shock. *I* fired the quantum torpedoes that killed a Borg cube. That’s definitely going on my resume.

But then this *other* little ball-shaped bugger shoots out from it. Captain Picard orders a pursuit course. Seconds away from Earth. The whole Federation hangs in the balance. I get the firing solution locked in. And then...I stood down and got relieved.”

“What!? I thought you said the Borg were practically on top of Earth! And you were so close another ship got caught in the explosion. Surely Captain Picard immediately ordered you to shoot it down.”

“No, he was too busy talking with Worf.”

“Worf!? The guy who killed Gowron *and* Duras? Wasn’t he at Deep Space Nine? What was he doing on the Enterprise?”

“I dunno, he just showed up. Picard and Riker asked him if he still remembered how to use the tactical console and then shooed me aside.”

“Did he!?”

“I mean, he never trained on the Sovereign. By the time he figured out how to target the ball, it had opened a time portal and turned the whole planet into a Borg colony.”

“You can’t be serious!”

“We lost four hundred people over the next two days.”

“Oh my god.”

—

“We spent almost an hour trying to clear the debris from the med bay where we heard the shouting. Lost two good men to roving Borg attacks. Finally we got the door open. Suddenly I have an EMH in my face shouting something to me about this being a completely inappropriate use of his program and if we could please shut him off before we left.”

“Yeah, I, uh, never had that problem before. Seriously. ^Please ^don’t ^look ^at ^the ^logs.”

—

“We came across holodeck two on our way back to the bridge. The music coming through the half-open door is what made us notice it. It was a complete bloodbath inside. Someone had left the program running with the safeties off. There was a pile of Borg bodies around the door. Some kind of period story running with gangsters and machine guns in a club. We hadn’t taken two steps when all of a sudden they started shooting at us from behind a makeshift blockade of tables. Lost another good man then.

We tried to shoot back, but there were just too many of them. We retreated when we heard more Borg coming. Hid for a bit and watched them march into the holodeck. It was the most surreal thing I’ve ever seen. Like some kind of cult thing. They had to know it was suicide. But they couldn’t give up. Not without admitting resistance wasn’t futile, and resistance from a bunch of holographic gangsters no less.”

—

“We were sprinting through the auxiliary loading room when all of a sudden, Sam, my best man, trips. But some godforsaken idiot had left the space door open. He goes flying through the forcefield and straight into orbit. Nothing we could do. You know the first thing they teach you at the Academy?”

“To tell the truth?”

“No. Put your f***ing tools away and leave the work area like you found it. I swear if I ever find out who left that goddamn door open, I’ll petition Admiral Picard myself to have him kicked out of the service.”

—

“...but of course nobody bothered to tell *me* we were evacuating. There I was, trapped in a Jeffries tube with a bunch of Borg drones. My men dead, all the escape pods gone. I was a goner for sure. I started to put my phaser on overload. Then, suddenly all the Borg all dropped to the floor. I grabbed a tricorder...all dead.”

“What!? No way. How does that happen?”

“Well, I wasn’t there, but scuttlebutt is that Commander Data...did *something*...to the Borg. *(hand gesture)*”

“Are...are you saying the Enterprise’s second officer f***ed the Borg to death!?”

“I mean...he didn’t out and out say it, but a couple days later someone jokingly asked him if he was looking forward to R&amp;R, and how long it’d been since he’d gotten some ‘downtime’. All he said was ‘If you are referring to sexual activity, then 2 days, 6 hours, and 34 minutes’. Conversation came to a dead stop. That’s within ten minutes of when I saw those Borg drones drop.”

They had engineering locked down *really* tight too. Called it a ‘coolant leak’. Yeah, right. When that happened on the Enterprise D, the whole stardrive blew up. Warp coolant can’t melt Borg exoskeletons, either. It was clearly a coverup.”

Like Space Seed has all of the low budget 60's cheese, no more than most other episodes, and I think for me at least that episode works so well becuase the writing is so good in spite of the very dated presentation, including the dilog, which while still of that era but it also feels, idk, more mature I guess. This is just my opinion but I feel if more episodes were done as well as episodes like that the dated cheese and low budget wouldn't be nearly as much of a problem to modern audiences. Personally there's only a few episodes of TOS I really like, and I realize it's the becuase I don't think the writing was all that good for most of them City on the Edge of Forever I think is the only episode that really has none of these problems.

73,[Essay] Cardassians are Star Trek's most fascinating race. Why? Because they're the most human. They are also especially fascinating to non-Western fans. Here's why,1598979856,"Sorry for the long post but please believe me that I couldn't make this any shorter without sacrficing essential details. I made it as short as I possibly could to the best of my abilities.

I'm a life long Star Trek fan. Yet it was only this year that I watched DS9 for the first time. However, I was already fascinated by the Cardassians in TNG, specifically from the two-part Chains of Command. However, I am from and live in a country where I can get to appreciate the Cardassians far more than any Trekkie in a developed, western democracy.

They are the most fleshed out race and civilisation in all of Trek. Far more than the Klingons, the Romulans, the Vulcans, the Changelings, the Borg, the Ferengi. You get my point.

Why do I say so? Because each of these races were intended to be one-dimensional extremes or manifestations of one or two human characteristics. The Klingons are grunting machos. The Romulans are cunning fiends. The Vulcans are rational objective thinkers. The Changelings are the bullied who became bullies. The Borg are all-conquering Mongols. The Ferengi are capitalists. I know that I must have missed some nuances but these descriptions are the gist of it and are what is intended by the writers. Each race is meant for the audiences to look at one or two aspects of their humanity vividly.

It is not so easy to put the Cardassians into such a box. There were so complex and multi-faceted. The episodes where this really becomes exemplified are S1 E18 ""Duet"", S2 E5 ""Cardassians"", S2 E18 ""Profit and Loss"", and S3 E5 ""Second Skin."" In these episodes you really get to see the very complex political and social situation on Cardassia. They aren't a monolithic people represented by the state. They have dissidents. They have anti-government activitists. They have people who want revolution. They have high ranking military officers who want regime change. In these episodes and over the course of DS9, Cardassians were shown to be as diverse and difficult to fully describe as humans are.

""Second Skin"" really hit me emotionally. Ghemor is no different than any human parent who wishes to be reunited with their long lost child. The drama of his character and the interplay between him and Kira was not alien or unrelatable at all. These episodes were especially heartbreaking because they were a big reminder of the tragedy my own country is.

This brings me to how Cardassia is especially fascinating and difficult for someone like me to watch. I've seen many of you comparing the Cardassian Union to fascist Italy or the Third Reich. I would disagree because Cardassia is typical of a third-world military dictatorship on present-day Earth. There were military dictatorships in the recent past just like them in South America and there are ones today in Africa, the Arab world, and Asia whose politics and internal security practices are exactly like the Cardassian Union.

These dicatorships are poor, mid-level regional powers with bloated military budgets spent at the expense of their people. I am not revealing my country or my continent because my own country has an internal security and intelligence agencies just like the Obsidian Order. They can hear and see and know everything and make people disappear exclusively for something you post on the internet. They are also very powerful and have much more influence and control over government than our ""elected"" parliament. Their agents could be the guy who is selling you fruit and vegetables on the street corner, or even a plain simple tailor who speaks in half truths and in a very devious opaque manner.

The torture scene in Chains of Command is just too real. The way our own dissidents and suspected terrorists are treated in our own secret facilities is exactly the same. The interrogator is usually a well and softly spoken man who tries to befriend you while doing monstrous things to you simultaneously. My skin crawled watching that episode and remembering testimonials from our torture victims.

Lastly, the Cardassian justice system was not something the writers creatively came up with. It was merely a literal and explicit depiction of how the justice systems in these petty military dictatorships actually work. If you are arrested for political reasons, the authorities have already decided what's going to happen to you. It might as well be as explicit as it is on Cardassia. The trial is just for show, to show the people how victorious the state is over its enemies and send a warning to anyone who dares to even think a single thought of dissent.

I hope you found my essay and interesting and I hope you've learned something new. And I hope that you will appreciate the Cardassians even more and perhaps in a whole new way.

74,"Fan theory on Romulans, Vulcan, The Admonition, and a few special guest stars...",1598979344,"It's accepted fact that Vulcans and Romulans are a divergent species. It's lesser known that there is a throw away line in TOS where Spock speculates that Vulcans are not indigenous to Vulcan but are decendants of the Arretan's due to similarities in Vulcan myth to their story. But the destruction of the Arretans was about 400,000 years ago.

We do not know who exactly built the Admonition, but we know it's about 200,000 to 300,000 years old, and built by artificial life. A period after the destruction of the Arretan civilization. We also know the Iconians were an ancient and powerful civilization that was destroyed by bombardment from space about 200,000 years ago by an unknown force.

The Vulcans, Romulans, and other ""Proto-Vulcan"" species  are the former Iconians, who were the Arretan's.  

For millenia this species has risen to greatness through hubris and technological mastery, only to be destroyed by their own hands or by their AI slaves. Some time in the past, Vulcan faced another similar situation where they were nearly wiped out. Surak, recognizing the arrogance of their race has led to repeated near-extinction, created logic and the desire to purge emotion as a way to save their race and end the cycle. The Romulans refused and set off to find their own way, choosing to forever shun AI instead of embracing logic as a way to break the cycle.

Thus, the struggle to achieve humility through logic and avoiding exploration and scientific discover for centuries by the Vulcans was a solution. The Romulans desire to destroy all AI which has slowed their technology to a crawl is the other. Both are a desire to avoid the cycle of violence and playing God through technology.",startrek,eternalkerri,False,/r/startrek/comments/iko1bj/fan_theory_on_romulans_vulcan_the_admonition_and/

78,Does each alternative reality has its own Q?,1598975506,"Lately I’ve been wondering if there’s one Q on each Star Trek timeline or if he’s the same on each of them. I really want to believe in the former but right now I think the first is more likely 

On Tapestry (TNG S06EP15) Q sends Picard to his past. The result is that the future was changed. Was it? We don’t know if by not fighting with the Nausicaans the Picard we know was sent to another timeline or if our reality was altered. But that’s, as far as I know the closest thing we’ve seen from Q traveling through alternative realities (though I bet he can visit if them he wants to). 

Laterly, on Parallels (S07EP11), we see thousands of Enterprises in one of the realities. In one of them, the Federation was defeated by the Borg. However we do know that Q was the one who introduced the Borg to the Picard and the Federation (S02EP16). And why did he do this? He wanted to make a point. Simple as that. And he did it. Picard admitted that Q was right. 

It is possible, of course (in fact very likely) that in one of the alternative universes the Federation and the Borg had a different encounter. But that’s probably the very exception considering how distant from the Federation the Borg are and especially the many other alternative timelines we’ve seen that don’t suggest anything like this. 

So, unless we are facing a very unlikely coincidence or Q wants to make this very same point again (and again, considering that in one of the realities Worf was transported on Parallels Picard was killed fighting the Borg) each reality has its own Q.

I always found Q’s might somehow overrated. They’re probably the most powerful species in Star Trek Universe, though a few others might be on the same level, like the Organians, Dowd or the Trelane species, but if I’m right I guess they kinda hit the rockbottom to me.

If you are interested in something like that, please send me a DM.

I am in the US Mountain Standard Time zone (GMT -7), but I don't have a preference for where this buddy lives, provided we can work out an amenable schedule for our regular discussions.

I have started out of production order with TNG, but I am only about halfway into S1, so I'm open to starting from TOS (which I haven't seen at all) and then picking up where I left off with TNG.

Right now,  I'm watching (roughly) at a rate of 2 episodes per day during the week (not much on weekends). I'm not sure if I can keep that tempo up for the duration of nearly 800 episodes + movies, but I am certainly going to try. 

&amp;#x200B;

My ST knowledge is fairly limited to TNG-era canon, and most of that is fuzzy because the last time I watched an episode was sometime in the mid-90s. I have seen all of the pre-reboot movies, but many of them so long ago that I might as well have not seen them at all.

&amp;#x200B;

Aside from the in-universe discussions that I hope to have, I'm also hoping to pick at various themes, underlying premises, how things have held up over the years (scientifically, thematically, culturally, etc.), evolution of characters, races, meta-discussions on premises, and on and on.

24,The Pakleds...a missed opportunity?,1598910288,"Please bear with me, haha.

I realize they are generally the worst written aliens of the week and that unlike the Ferengi on DS9, there really is no redeeming the Pakleds.  I'm offering this as a slight modification to their characterization in hopes that they might be viewed as a missed chance to really challenge the ethos of the 24th Century Federation.

The setup for this species is actually fine.  They disarm with their poor diction and seeming hapless ineptitude and then they suddenly strike like kidnappers/terrorists.  The problem is that they continue to be imbecilic throughout the kidnapping of Geordi and we see that the low IQ act was not really an act.  They are bastards, but they are also easily fooled morons.  The solution to kidnapping Geordi is rather poorly written but it seems that any number of ways to out think the Pakleds would have sufficed.

What if instead they were written as a race of sociopaths?

It could have been a very interesting episode if they peeled off their fake up-swept eyebrows (Thomas Riker style) and suddenly switched to flawless diction.  If they used theatrics but were ruthless and calculating AND clearly intelligent, and if we as the viewers were as taken in by their falsely dumpy appearance as the crew was, there'd be more payoff.  (This is more plausible if Troi cannot sense their deception and it might allow for Worf to have finally, independently, to be right about SOMETHING.)

What could have been fascinating is the crew discussing them as a race that somehow did not go extinct while sociopathy became a dominant genetic trait among their people.  Troi may not have sensed mal-intent because there was no real emotion behind their actions to be sensed.  They were simply finding the most direct route to attain their goals and torturing Geordi with a phaser was that most direct route.  If diplomacy had presented as a better option, they may well have gone in that direction.  But a species that truly does not have any sense of right or wrong, and no better nature to appeal to, no concept of why you SHOULDN'T torture an alien just to get their tech...that's actually interesting.  It's particularly interesting in the era of ""we've found that honor is a commonality with the Klingons and so they are not so different after all.""  Or later in The Enemy, ""We've found that Romulans actually care for their crew-mates as much as we do, we have commonalities that could form a basis for understanding.""  I would just love to see the highly principled 24th Century diplomats coming face to face with a species that they fundamentally cannot relate to.  That no high minded speech from anyone on the Enterprise could possibly persuade the Pakleds.  And even if we do get out of this situation with them, what could a truly amoral species resort to next?  Could diplomatic relations ever be sustained?   Should they even be allowed to travel through space if they are just a likely to predate on others as to openly trade with them?  Would a technological advantage even mean much against such an unpredictable foe with a total lack of morality?  And what if they continue leaping up the tech ladder?  Could that even be allowed?

I think some of my favorite TNG episodes presents these types of moral dilemmas or interesting questions.  The bulk of the episode revolving around a simple debate about what is to be done now that a race of sociopaths is loose in the galaxy could be fascinating.  Instead, they are just mean dopes who have not ""developed"" enough.  They trick the crew so the crew lamely tricks them back.  Just a missed chance to make something a bit more interesting, I feel.   A kind of anti-Federation in that they have no real tech power...they have no real diplomatic skills...and no unity with other species...but even without these attributes they somehow find cold and calculating ways to empower themselves by thinking of ruthless or amoral approaches the crew struggles to even imagine.

If this approach had been taken with the Pakleds, I'd have welcomed return visits by the species, if just to see the unique types of dilemmas they'd create for the crew and the havoc they might bring to the quadrant.

46,Thoughts On Voyager,1598878852,"Just finished rewatching Voyager, and I found quite a lot of positives from what a lot of other people consider negatives of the show.

Mostly, what I love about Voyager is that it is as close to TOS as any Berman-era Trek. It focusses more on plot and missions than on individual character stories. We never got McCoy episodes or Scotty episodes back in TOS. The focus was on the crew working together, and it's one of Voyager's strengths. I loved the focus on character stories in DS9, but I was ready for more of the kind of crew-focus we see on TOS by the end.

As a result, one of the biggest criticisms of Voyager is the lack of character development: I agree that quite a few characters are never fleshed out properly (Harry Kim deserves the biggest mention here), and don't get much individual screen time. But, as a positive spin, it gave me more of a scope to make up my own back story or history for them. 

My only real issue with Voyager is that the ending felt a bit rushed. Admittedly, I'm glad that Voyager is the last place we see the crew before they fly off towards Earth. It's the place we got to know them and care about them over 7 seasons, and many consider it their home. Though it would have been nice to have been given a longer send off. The final scene is about 30 seconds and then it's over. You don't get a chance to reflect or look back; it's just a shot of Voyager flying towards Earth, and that's it.",startrek,Scotty_C_89,False,/r/startrek/comments/ijxj6a/thoughts_on_voyager/

I have Netflix and I tried to watch it again but it was a no go. I even jumped forward a few seasons and still nothing.

I liked the Tribbles episode only because of the revisiting of the original episode.

61,I think I finally figured out Star Trek's main problem.,1598847780,"Since 2009, Star Trek has not stopped trying incredibly hard to be cool.

This post obviously excludes Lower Decks.

But I was thinking about TOS/TNG/DS9/VOY/ENT, and they all completely and totally lean into what they are. Even when ENT had those dumb decon scenes, that was barely anything compared to what 2009-Present Trek tries now.

Current Trek is trying so hard to be something else and THAT is what has caused the root problem which leads to bad writing, behind the scenes shake ups, weird choices, etc.

I'm not saying Trek can't do something new. DS9 was drastically different than TNG, even more so at the time. Trek can be new, but it needs to be Trek. So don't tell me ""oh you just want cardboard sets"" or ""tv is different now.""

And I don't think it has anything to do with serial vs episodic either. We had both in Trek before.

Think of the television landscape when TNG aired in syndication. You had adventure shows like Xena and Highlander. And TNG didn't ""try to be cool"" like it does now, it TRIED TO BE STAR TREK. It was a space adventure show. It was dorky. It was nerdy. And guess what? Because it was good, it got fans. 

Look at the Arrowverse shows on the CW. Nowadays they are extremely comic booky, and they are successful! They lean into what they are. But it wasn't always this way.

When Arrow started, the Marvel Cinematic Universe wasn't a thing. The ""best"" superhero movie was the realistic, non comic booky Nolan Batman movies. So Arrow imitated that and he didn't even have a proper mask or the name ""Green Arrow."" But the CW changed and adapted and now they have like 5 or 7 shows or something. All not ashamed to honor the source material. They now have true to comic costumes and follow comic plotlines. They gave the fans what they wanted and have been rewarded.

Star Trek COULD be like this. If it stopped trying so hard to be The Game of Thrones for CBS All Access (this is what they said Disco was trying to be before it came out), or the Logan movie (Picard) or basically any explodey, camera spinning, frantic dialogue, no breathing room, non sensical plot, special effects, all flash and no substance fest show that it is trying so hard to emulate, then maybe we could have actual Star Trek again. Movies that aren't summer popcorn action movies starring beautiful people with shit plots.

Imagine a Star Trek show that lived on the CW alongside those DC shows, where they are not afraid to have crazy superhero costumes and the Trek Show would not be afraid to be actual Star Trek instead of a shitty syfy channel level mess that is practically Trek in name only.

Lord of the Rings is not cool. Star Wars is not cool. But they have tons of fans and they don't try to be anything other than what they are.

Star Trek isn't about the good looking faces of a Chris Pine or Zoe Saldana. Or the whatever Disco season 1 was.

Star Trek needs to stop trying to be cool. It always found its audience before, and it will again, just fine. Hopefully Strange New Worlds will be this.

89,Contemplating the philosophy of Star Trek,1598811876,"Hello all!

I have recently started season two of TNG and I am captivated by some of the intricacies that are held by some of the episodes. Specifically, episode three *Elementary, Dear Data*. This episode has become my favorite of the both seasons so far. I am sure this could potentially change as I continue on in my journey to watch all of Star Trek, however, it is momentarily at the top. 

The reason being for this accolade is because of the philosophy that it presents us with. Data is presented with a worthy adversary,Professor Moriarty, in the attempts to elicit a more defined sense of Data's living existence and proof that he can think originally. This resulted in Professor Moriarty gaining a consciousness and arguably, becoming something that is living. The issue of what to do with Moriarty fell onto Captain Picard and what was once an issue of simply deleting arbitrary code became a moral issue (i.e., deleting something that was living). 

This episode made me feel like I was Captain Picard when confronted with the decision of either saving Moriarty or deleting him. It allowed me to contemplate the philosophy of the mind by asking thought provoking questions such as, what is consciousness or when does a computer program become a living thinking thing? I will digress now. Star Trek is awesome  and I look forward to adding more episodes to my favorites list.

I would have loved to see Picard beg Starfleet to allow him to command an old, mothballed Galaxy Class starship with only a skeleton crew manning it, ideally including some of the old Enterprise along with some younger Starfleet officers willing to sacrifice their careers to assist Picard to pursue some obscure mission of diplomacy or conflict aversion, the importance of which is only realized by Picard and his crew until the very last second.

Instead, we see the writers afford Picard a crappy private ship he is barely in command of with a crew that was purposefully written to be unlikeable and contemptuous of Starfleet principles, and I honesty don’t see the point of doing Picard dirty like that. I get that the premise is meant to force Picard to operate on constrained resources and minimal Starfleet support, but I think this could and should have been done within the scope of Starfleet, ideally by reinstating him in Starfleet but relegating him to command an old, sub-standard Galaxy class starship.

7,Could the Federation be in the Delta Quadrant?,1598778498,"My answer is yes, but it'll take a lot of work. First you need to get there somehow, explore the quadrant and make your way back. Thanks to Voyager, some parts of the Delta quadrant (if not a lot) have been charted. New propulsion technology (such as trans warp and slipstreams) has also been discovered making it easier to travel there and back. Plus they have an ambassador which can look out for potential worlds that want to be part of the federation. Long range communication was also possible. So all the knowledge has been filled out, all that is left is the action. 

Finding worlds are difficult. You would have to advertise the Federation to various worlds. There would probably also be such a hefty amount of paperwork filled to joined the Federation and not all worlds would be interested. 

Creating a new type of propulsion drive would be extremely expensive. Expensive as all new technology is. So there probably would still be many outdated warp cores in vessels. I think that there would have to be thing starships known as quadrant to quadrant ships were those ships would use the new types of drives. 

You also have to deal with problem of various governments not just in the delta but also nearby governments. For example, the Klingons could start a 'holy war'. The Cardassians could attempt to try to occupy and create another demilitarized zone and another Maquis would be formed.  

Federation presence is possible however considering the effort it would take, it would be a very long process. Thanks to Voyager, the Federation are a few steps closer to achieving this.",startrek,Status738,False,/r/startrek/comments/ij9vw7/could_the_federation_be_in_the_delta_quadrant/

Heck I can get season 2 of Discovery for $37.99 on Blu Ray right now. Looking ahead this seems to be a problem for DS9, Voyager, and Enterprise as well but I'm watching the series with my partner and won't buy those until we actually are getting close to needed them.

21,"Next Generation ""bottle episodes"" are some of my favorites",1598757961,"**bottle episode**, *n*.  An inexpensively produced episode of a television series that is typically confined to one setting

According to Memory Alpha, bottle episodes were often used to save money (either because production had a more expensive episode planned or because the show was already running over budget). But the constraints that this caused often resulted in more compelling TV, as the show couldn't rely on extensive action or flashy special effects to entertain the audience.

Examples:

* ""Where Silence has Lease"" - Pair the creepiness of a ""hole"" in space and a ""ghost"" USS Yamato with the horror of an inscrutable entity who plans on killing half the crew for an experiment, and you've got a great episode.
* ""Remember Me"" - A Crusher-centric episode that wipes away the stain of ""Sub Rosa"". I love the slowly building panic as more and more people disappear from the Enterprise. Excellent acting by Gates McFadden.
* ""Clues"" - Any episode where Picard gets to play Dixon Hill is great in my book. I also like the methodical unraveling of Data's cover-up and his perplexing reluctance to reveal his motives.
* ""Conundrum"" - Worf has the sash, so *of course* he's in charge. I also really like how the crew, even with memories wiped, attempt to resolve the situation in a professional and deliberate manner. No stupid power struggles (especially before they determined their identities and rank), mutual distrust, or other such clichés .

Later, of course, we learn that Ferengi death rituals are nothing like that.  Instead they auction off body parts to the highest bidder.  I know that the TNG writers didn't know this yet, it wouldn't become part of Ferengi lore until DS9.  But it's always been a minor continuity hiccup.

My new headcanon:  The scientist's family lied to Picard.  They gave him some mumbo jumbo about the sanctity of the bodies of the dead because they knew humans would believe that junk.

77,"Damar and Dukat, a very important relationship",1598657408,"From the very first time we see Damar, to the last days of his life, he was devoted to Dukat. Rather then being a military officer trying to move up the ranks, Damar seemed more on a personal mission to prove his worth to Dukat. Whether it was at his side on a cargo ship, fighting Klingons, forging the alliance with the Dominion or occupying DS9 he was right at Dukat’s side. Uncharacteristic for a Cardassian military officer, he was loyal to one man.

The two of them disagreed at times and had some arguments, but Dukat won every single one. Damar always bowed to Dukat’s opinion, even when he strongly disagreed with it. Yet Dukat never seemed challenged by the conflicts. The man who trusted nobody, trusted Damar.

Damar hated the affection Dukat looked at Kira with, but most of all he had a special hatred of Ziyal, Dukat’s daughter. He passionately hated that she was a “daughter of Cardassia,” who couldn’t care lees. She was the child who got all of Dukat’s love and attention, while Damar was just an aide. He thought bringing down the mine blockade would earn Dukat’s respect, but that never happened. Ziyal was still Dukat’s favorite. Even after she admitted she had helped the rebels and lost Cardassia DS9, Dukat still loved her.

That’s the moment Damar snapped. All his rage poured out and he shot Ziyal dead. To him, he was loyal, and she was a traitor, yet she got Dukat's love and respect. He hated Ziyal because she was given what he had always worked so hard for from Dukat — The love of a father. Cain vs Able. It’s just that simple.

Damar was Dukat’s illegitimate son.

Damar was most likely told over and over never to make it known for fear of ruining their families and both their careers. Only to have Dukat throw it all away for Ziyal, ""a bastard half-breed unworthy of such a great man."" Certainly, Dukat never acted like a married man, so the chance of another illegitimate child is very possible. When he lost almost everything, he made sure to move this young man Damar under his command so he could shepherd him, and so Dukat would have the loyalty and devotion he craved so much. Damar’s line “daughter of Cardassia,” was a hint, an expression of his anger at not being a ‘true’ son. It seems impossible that a man like Dukat wouldn't blame Damar for killing his daughter. Perhaps, Dukat understood why it happened, and chose to blame Sisko rather than his own flesh and blood.

When Damar was in charge of all Cardassia, he became a drunk because he was alone. His mentor Dukat showing up made him cower, and then rethink his life. As Weyoun admonishes the former leader, Damar stands up for him. And when Dukat shows up again in the last days, looking for someone who he could count on for help, he knew he could turn to Damar. In a military organization where everyone stabs each other in the back, these two men stand out.

In the last days of the Dominion war, Dukat tells Damar to stand up and lead Cardassia. No doubt Damar heard “Do this, and I will finally be proud of you.” He starts the rebellion right then and there. Even his cry “For Cardassia” seems to have a hidden meaning, since his motives are more than just a liberator.

Casey Biggs has commented on how surprised he was that they brought him in multiple times to read to be cast as Damar, since he only had a couple of lines. They had something important planned for this character years later, though I doubt they knew just what. 


The tension and friendship between Dukat and Damar was unique, and was based, IMHO, on the fact that Damar was Dukat’s illegitimate son.",startrek,PastorBlinky,False,/r/startrek/comments/iii0zq/damar_and_dukat_a_very_important_relationship/

Either way, this could be seen as a commentary on how humans of today should not be interfering with other environments, such as cutting down forests to make way for farmland or subdivisions.

Maybe the acting style was just more similar to what I consider to be good acting nowadays. But the difference between the two seems worlds apart.

I would argue that The Borg was the greatest threat in all the series.

The Borg never tired; it was like an endless existential hunger. Not to mention assimilation and adaptation. I can’t say much about the Xindi, but like the Dominion their troops were sentient and vulnerable to the same flaws. 
Now, on to the captains. As far as I remember Kirk never fought a war on par with the later tv series. Picard couldn’t beat the Borg even with the full power of Starfleet at his disposal. The only way the Dominion was defeated was with the combined forces of Starfleet, the Klingons, and the Romulins(?) Janeway not only defeated the Borg, but did so on their home turf and without any assistance from Starfleet or anyone. Not to mention a ship nowhere near as powerful as the Enterprise, and that was undoubtedly running low on supplies and a demoralized crew.  Sure they had Seven of Nine to give them insight into the Collective, but one mind wouldn’t give them as much of an advantage against the millions and possibly billions of minds of the Collective working together.

What I believe after careful thought is that the Tuvix consciousness lives on, but is split between Neelix and Tuvok, and this is the natural state.

I know a lot of people don't give a shit about Tuvix and even if it was murder you don't even think it matters, just bring back your ""boys"" Neelix and Tuvok. However for people who have a conscience, and sense of ethics and right and wrong, this episode needs to be processed. I stated even right up front that had I been Tuvix I would have wanted to be separated because I would have seen that I would live on as two consciousnesses, and that is the natural state of both of those life-forms to be separate not combined. In essence Tuvix gets a two-for-one deal on life  by separating. But my first reaction was also that Tuvix should have been allowed to make this decision. I no longer think so. That would be like allowing an insane person to make decisions about their own healthcare that modern medicine knows are bad choices. If somebody is not of sound mind they should not be allowed to harm themselves as Tuvix was doing by staying combined. After analyzing this I believe Tuvix is better off in his natural state which is living as two separate beings Neelix and Tuvok.

Mainly, I'm not particularly happy with the bridge crew. Bullies, bros, glory hunters, soulless bureaucrats, and in general what you would expect of a setting that lampoons and parodies authority, rather  than what one usually sees in Star Trek: professionals doing their honest best in jobs that they chose and for which they were chosen.

That said, the writers *could* be going for a ""bait and switch"" on this, going for that stereotypical ""American adult animation"" feel initially to ease in a larger potential audience, then toning it down as the series goes on. 

Beckett is a bit much, but this is the first episode, and there's no way that energy level is sustainable, so they'll likely tone it down as the series moves on.

My favorite characters, thus far, are D'Vana Tendi and Sam Rutherford. They're both a lot of fun.

And then there's Jack. Oh, look, it's a socially awkward guy that actually has faith in the system and believes in doing the right thing. I know, let's bully him! That's what we do in Star Trek, right?

___

**Episode 4 - ""Moist Vessel""**

* The *USS Merced* is like its sister ship named after what appears to be a wholly unremarkable town in California.
* True generational ships are conceptual vessels making journeys so long that their original crews are eventually replaced by their offspring. The *Voyager* was expected to be a generational ship had it made the entire journey back to the Alpha Quadrant, and along the way it encountered a generational ship in ""The Disease."" The moist vessel here is more accurately termed a sleeper ship, like Khan's *Botany Bay.*
* While exploring the ship, an ensign holds a flashlight that resembles a Type II phaser. This looks to be an uncharacteristic break from the show's tendency to use TNG-era technology...the flashlights used on previous shows were square ""palm beacons"" or lights attached to the wrist.
* The concept of turning inorganic matter into life was featured in the Genesis Device of *Wrath of Khan,* although this episode seems to draw more heavily from the ancient alien library of ""Masks.""
* Captain Durango (possibly named after Troi's mysterious stranger character in ""A Fistful of Datas"") is the first Tellarite seen in a Starfleet uniform (a Tellarite helmsman was mentioned in ""Apocalypse Rising""). Tellarites are the porcine chaps introduced in ""Journey to Babel"" and established as one of the four founding members of the Federation. Durango exhibits typical Tellarite pride later in the episode.
* Ascension is not a specific reference, but Tendi's description of a normal person being transformed into pure energy was what happened to John Doe in ""Transfigurations."" O'Connor's actual Ascension later in the episode makes him all glowy like John Doe.
* Rutherford compares Ascended energy beings to the Q, a group of omnipotent gadabouts first seen in ""Encounter at Farpoint.""
* His other suggestion is The Traveler, the mystical being from Tau Alpha C who takes a creepy liking to Wesley in ""Where No Man Has Gone Before"" et al.
* This is a placeholder for whatever the Ascender's necklace is from; I'm sure it must be something but someone else will figure it out.
* Tendi gets distracted by a gong; the Bajorans used ceremonial gongs during childbirth.
* Holodecks being used mostly for ""that"" is a long-standing fan joke. Quark rented out several holoprograms of an adult nature, including deepfaking Kira, while a less-than-subtle allusion was offered by Riker's ""I'll be in Holodeck Four"" in ""The Perfect Mate.""
* We see the senior officers' poker game, a staple of TNG. There is very little in the scene to suggest any of the officers actually know how to play poker, which could itself be a reference to TNG's falling back on ""movie poker"" tropes; the only thing missing was a string bet.
* Putting another placeholder for all the things everyone else is going to notice about Tendi's multicultural Ascension garb. Put me to shame, kids, I got nothin'.
* Tendi unleashes bugs, claiming them to be an Ascension ritual for the Tamarians. The Children of Tama, or ""Meme People,"" are the subjects of the famous episode ""Darmok"" who speak only in metaphor. If Tendi knows something about their culture, it's likely that relations have finally been established with them.
* Boimler pretends he is on the holodeck speaking to ""Moriarty."" Professor James Moriarty is the holodeck realm's most feared villain (from this dimension, anyway), having seized control of the *Enterprise* in ""Elementary Dear Data"" and ""Ship in a Bottle.""
* Force fields in starship corridors were seen in episodes like ""Brothers"" and ""The Game.""
* ""Perizene gas"" has not been seen on the show before, but dispersing gas throughout the ship to magically cure whatever's going wrong is nothing new.
* As O'Connor Ascends he reports being able to see Abraham Lincoln. President Lincoln once visited Kirk's *Enterprise*...it must have been the actual Lincoln, since Kirk treated him as though he was, because why would Kirk be so batshit crazy as to treat an alien like a long-dead president.
* O'Connor's vision of a smiling koala could indicate he is on his way to Fourecks.
* The admiral's pronunciation of ""sense-oars"" is canonically valid and Mariner is out of line.",startrek,Antithesys,False,/r/startrek/comments/ihju2r/canon_references_moist_vessel_spoilers/
76,Is my Lwaxana Troi doll missing the earrings/a defective model? :D,1598529089,"I found this Lwaxana Troi doll NIB at a shop for $8 recently and jumped at the chance to have her in my life.  


But I did notice... in the photos on the package, the doll of Lwaxana is wearing a larger dangling earring, much closer resembling the one in the photograph and outfit she is modeled after.

However my actual doll features a very small round earring. It's such a silly detail to notice but I'm just deadly curious if somehow the photos on the packing are a prototype that was not ultimately sold, or if I've somehow gotten a defective/misprinted doll?

78,Inaccuracy in several Star Trek series (Minor),1598527385,"2 of the 5 things that bring me joy in life are Star Trek and Poker.

I'm currently making my way through all the episodes of all series and I'm in Voyager. For the first time I remember, they are playing poker. They also played alot of poker on TNG and I THINK they played it in DS9 once, but mostly played Dabo.

Anyway, the error is this: in poker verbal is binding to the action you are to take. Also you get one action per turn only. So if you say something and do a different action, the verbal stands (there is a exception if you said call and folded your cards, it would be a ""dead hand"" but I digress). It is not correct to say ""I see your 10 and raise 20"" because you actually stated two actions verbally. The see is what poker refers to as a ""call"" and it is to match the previous bet. A raise is if you intended to bet more than the previous better. So if you wanted to incorrectly ""see 10 and raise 20"" the right way would be to say ""raise to 30 total"". You could also say ""20 more"" or even not say a word at all, and put out 30. You do NOT have to say a single word while playing if you choose. The actions can speak for you (helpful when playing with non English speakers). 

Bonus poker etiquette tip, careful with your chips. If you put out 10 to call past the bet line, reached back and put in another 20 for a raise, the 20 would be returned to you and your turn would be considered just a call because that is considered two actions, albeit nonverbal. The way around this is in one smooth motion cross the bet line with all 30 in one stack. You can also mix verbal and nonverbal slightly. You could say ""raise"" count out your chips in front of you but before the bet line, and then when you cross the bet line with the chips that is what your raise would be.

Now, that said, if you use poker in future series please keep this in mind. Thank you.

Edit: bet line may be a actual oval on the whole table or may not be marked. Visualize a oval 6-9 inches in front of your chips all the way around the table.",startrek,youdontknowmejabroni,False,/r/startrek/comments/ihj8uy/inaccuracy_in_several_star_trek_series_minor/

It is a crucial part of the plot that anti-matter particles did not phase and there is a drain, which resulted both Voyagers to operate on 1 warp cure.

The Borg were scary, aggressive and mysterious which is what made them a great villain in the first place. They even ended it on the message that was sent that it would take 200 years to be heard. Was it sent? Hmmm... I like how it brought everything full circle. Brilliant!

98,Just finished the Picard finale after watching all prior episodes/movies/shorts in chronological order and wanted to discuss (Spoilers),1598500586,"As the title says, just finished all prior canon going mostly by this list: http://thestartrekchronologyproject.blogspot.com/2009/09/and-now-conclusion.html?m=1 
(Had to piece together some of the short treks orders and some came out after I was past that point in the order)

Mainly wanted to give my thoughts on the closing minutes of the Picard finale but would love to discuss anything related to the watch order. 

1. Loved River coming in last minute to save the day with a one liner. I was worried Frakes would have aged out of the captains chair based off how he looked a few episodes prior but they clean him up and we finally get to see Riker in command as something other than Acting Captain. (I do wish they had more variety in federation ships.)

2. That final scene with Data. Couldn’t have been any better. I think we all agree his death in Nemesis wasn’t a great death. (I believe they were setting up a “Star Trek: III part 2: search for data” that never came.) so seeing him again was great. Also the way they shot the scene, it’s a Picard’s office at his estate, floating in space. Pretty much sums up the good parts of Picard’s life all while being a call back to the All Good things finale. Also the actor playing Soji/Raj is the one singing the cover of Blue Skies. I like to think Data is listening to his daughter sing as passes.

3. I love what they did with 7. She progressed so much in 4 years on voyager. It’s more believable than not that she would grow in here personality. (People complaints about what that personality is are valid, but I do disagree with those complaints). Also great seeing her and Picard onscreen together.

4. The call backs are great. In my opinion they don’t cross the line of being toxic fan service. I loved Hugh and how the actor played the character. Makes sense for him to be there and involved in the plot as well. The admiral that was Picard’s friend at the academy in “Tapestry”? What a great call back that also makes sense. Picard is calling in all the favors he has left, why wouldn’t he reach out to a youthful friend. On Maddox I didn’t even remember the antagonist name from “Measure of a Man” but what another tie-in tha makes sense in-universe. 

Criticisms: 

Plot Choices: I think the same basic plot could have happened with out the federation brass being evil. That trope is becoming over used especially here of late. However I do get social commentary aspect of it with the increasing popularity of isolationist policies against immigrants and refugees in the UK and US. It wouldn’t be Trek if those moments weren’t in the show. At least this time it was a Romulan plant and not section 31 or something.

Cameos:
I wish we saw more of the OG cast. I wanted Geordi to see Data one last time. I wanted Picard to at least mention Beverly. Maybe worf showing up in Klingon battle cruiser at the end with Riker. I know if all these happened it would be cliche and it’s for the best that they didn’t but I can’t help but wish they could have been worked in organically. Maybe in season 2. 

Picard is a robot now?: I’m still not sure about this. I’m open to it. I get how it’s consistent with the plot of androids are people too and I can live with that. My biggest complaint is, is it’s still Picard? Or is it just a copy of his brain cloned into a android with the same memories? It’s damn near stated explicitly that it is the same Picard and his conscience, but that’s just tough for me to grasp and the scene of him with data walking towards the  light before waking up as Android could signify his conscience actually dying.......

17,"Star Trek has a Ridiculously in depth and Varied Universe, Wh?y don't the Creators Branch Out",1598483788,"
The Star Trek universe is amazingly detailed, so why is the main focus generally on shipboard operations (with the exception of DS9?)

I'm curious what other themes of Federation society / culture people would like to see broken out and dissected.


Just as an example, I was always interested in what a Federation Ground Force would be like, either in combat or otherwise.   Im interested in that because that is my background.  

Whatever theme you want to see doesn't have to involve combat, or even ships.  Maybe its the Federation Financial system.  The Federation is said to be a ""post scaricity society"" so what does that mean at the nuts and bolts level?   What drives the people in that society and how does it relate with human nature?

My example
==============

I would love to see a series or season focused on life as a Federation Marine.  I really want to know:  Do they have spend hours a day with a tooth brush and dental pick cleaning weapons?   Why or why not?


How would they assault a planet and get through defenses that can reach out light years?  (Forced Entry Operation)

What would mortars look like? Would they even be mortars, or would they involve some type of small personal transport device?  How do ground combat operations flow together?  How do ground forces protect against orbital bombardment? Do they have surface-to-space missiles or something like that?  How would they robots, would it look like the skynet/terminator franchise with units of robits working together, or would it look like today?

What about the people involved? The Federation is a quasi-military organization with a focus on scientific achievement, so what does that mean for the characters? Are they full-time professional soldiers or would the Federation only raise Ground Forces when necessary?  What about thier relationships, attitude, or outlook on life?  Would they enter service believing in the ideals of the Federation, only to have that challenged after 5 years of war and combat?  What do fire fights look like when you can essentially teleport bullets through walls? Do they even use bullets anymore, or would it be a swarm of bullet size drones that seek out the genetic profile of the enemy?

21,Is the Cerritos/California-Class newer than we think?,1598475770,"I think its fair to say the California-class wasn't a runaway hit when we got our first pictures of the Cerritos, but that as we've gotten to know the ship, affection for it has grown. Although the ship is uncoventional in parts, the overall design fit neatly into the classic TNG asthetic.

Up to this point, my assumption (which I think was shared by Trekyards and a few others) was that the California-class was of the same design school/era as the Galaxy and Nebula classes, which would make the design (if not the ship) about twenty years old by the time we meet the LD crew in 2380.

However, looking at known Federation ship registries, the Cerritos (NCC-75567) was laid down nine-hundred ships after Voyager (NCC-74656)! This would suggest that Cerritos entered into service sometime between 2371-2375, making her not even a decade old when we meet her in the show. 

Given how crazy-close the Cerritos's registration is to that of the Defiant-class San Paulo, I'm guessing she entered into service in 2373 at the earliest. I say at the earliest because the hull-registry indicates the order in which a ship's construction is contracted, not her entry into service. Because the Defiant-class is much smaller and less construction-intensive than the California-class, it could be argued that the Cerritos might still have been under construction by the time the San Paulo was out of the yards and kicking Dominion teeth c.2373!

Beyond trivia, it is interesting to look at all of this in the broader scope of the Trek timeline. Assuming that the Cerritos is not a 'legacy build' of a older design, this would infer the California-class are contemporaries of the Nova and Intrepid and Sovereign-classes, which seems odd given how her visual language is more in-keeping with that of the previous design generation of ships. 

Given that the 'Calis' are the 'pickup truck' of Starfleet (general-purpose utility vehicles) that specialise in supporting First-Contact missions and doing the general follow-up grunt work, it is also interesting to consider why Starfleet saw the need to get this line of ships into construction during a time when they were teetering on the edge of hostilities with the Dominion.

Well, could the inciting factor be the discovery of the Bajoran wormhole in 2369? Suddenly massive new avenues have opened up for exploration and expansion into the Gamma Quadrant. Thanks to the Intrepid-build-programme, Starfleet has all the exploratory ships it needs coming down the pipe to meet this new oppurtunity, but suddenly finds itself short on the support ships needed to maintain so many exploratory operations.

Thus the need for a simple, straightforward medium-sized starship, a cheap-and-cheerful jack-of-all-stats, master-of-none. Something that can be designed and built quickly, pressures that might lead lead to modular construction and reuse of older tech and components from the Galaxy/Nebula generation of ships rather than the newer Intrepids/Sovereigns (where the kinks are still being hammered out).

The result? The California-class - and in this context, the slightly kitbashed and unorthodox design makes SENSE in light of Starfleet trying to speed-up construction by making use of what they already had to-hand!",startrek,rbdaviesTB3,False,/r/startrek/comments/ih7eet/is_the_cerritoscaliforniaclass_newer_than_we_think/

This violated a treaty the federation has with the romulans. And rather then keep its secret, picard reveals this to the romulans.!&lt;

It's not entirely clear just how much authorization rikers former commander, Pressman, had to conduct these experiments. He definitely had some people higher up who were ok with it since some of his mission was classified.  But by the end of the episode after his secret is revealed, he's under arrest and it looks like several other higher ups in starfleet are in trouble too.

But after watching it again I really wonder if Picard made the right choice. The romulans had no proof of what was being done. The enterprise managed to use the cloak and could have slipped away from the romulans completely undetected. Instead picard reveals to the romulans what was going on because he wants to uphold the treaty agreement.

Personally, I think starfleet should have saved the technology. Imagine what they could have done with it when the borg attacked. If nothing else, I don't think it should have been up to picard to notify the romulans of what happened. He should have returned to starfleet and let the federation contacting the romulan empire, if they would have decided to reveal it at all.",startrek,merkk,False,/r/startrek/comments/ih6l9m/tng_the_pegasus_was_picard_right/

The Star Trek universe is amazingly detailed, so why is the main focus generally on shipboard operations (with the exception of DS9?)

For example, I would love to see a series or season dedicated to ground combat done in a similar fashion as Band of Brothers or The Pacific.

How would they assault a planet and get through defenses that can reach out light years?  What would mortars look like? Would they even be mortars, or would they involve some type of small personal transport device?  How to ground combat operations flow together?  How do ground forces protect against orbital bombardment? Do they have surface-to-space missiles or something like that?

What about the people involved? The Federation is a quasi-military organization with a focus on scientific achievement, so what does that mean for the characters? Are they full-time professional soldiers or would the Federation only raise Ground Forces when necessary?

In DS9 there is a lot of dialogue regarding how the Federation either retook or lost planets.  I always wonder what it was like for the ""grunts"".

However we only see Saavik do the test, not cadets. Saavik is referred to as lieutenant for the rest of the movies she's in. So she is done the academy and received 1 or 2 promotions since. I really think the KM is overkill for a cadet. But for someone on their way from. Lt Jr grade to full Lt or Lt to Lt Cmdr, then you do need to know how they perform under pressure and in a possible no win scenario.

44,The definitive Mushroom thread,1598451536,"The idea behind the warp drive is that space can be warped, which has at least a loose basis in real science, general relativity.

The idea behind the transporter and the replicator and the holodeck are that matter and energy are different states of the same thing which is grounded in science even if we don't have any idea how we could achieve the kind of technological manipulation we see on the show, there is at least a scientific theory that's there.

Photon torpedo's are based on antimatter which is a real thing that exists and we in fact know how to make it, we just don't yet know how to make enough of it to use in weapons like torpedos. Same with the warp core which is powered by antimatter. 

Force fields have long been a part of science fiction and are now science fact. The military has force fields today. 

There are things in the Star Trek universe that are harder to explain but the Federation itself has always been built on loosely plausible science. The reason being it goes back to Gene Roddenberry's optimistic future. It can't be something we can hope for if it takes magic to accomplish. 

The mushrooms idea is magic. The idea of a spore or mushroom or fungus or whatever that grows throughout space time across universes is ridiculous and has no basis in science. How would such a ridiculously immense being sustain itself? How did it evolve? How is it connected to everything? What planet did it start out on? What selection pressures would cause a species to evolve to be able to span the multiverse? The idea that destroying it destroys all of reality is also ridiculous, that we're all dependent on this reality spanning fungus for survival. 

Even if you explained all of that, how are you riding a mushroom? When I touch a telephone, I don't get transmitted to the other telephone its connected to. Why would the spores act as conduits for ships to travel? What selection pressures caused the spore to evolve that ability? How would traveling along an Organic being allow for such precise jumps?

And I'm sorry even if you explained all of that, its a fucking intergalactic mushroom its inherently stupid without me having to explain why its stupid. They were on mushrooms when they came up with this idea.

45,I really don't like Discovery,1598449541,"I've seen many recent posts talk about how Discovery isn't so bad after all. These posts usually also accuse the part of the fanbase that doesn't like Discovery or Picard of toxicity, close-mindedness, or being racist/sexist which I find really concerning in these polarizing times. It is okay to like something others dislike, but it is also just as valid to dislike something others may like. How is that even up for debate? When I am criticizing Discovery I am not saying you are dumb for liking it, I am just saying that IN MY OPINION the generously paid people who created and wrote the show could and should have done a MUCH better job at doing so.

Now, personally I don't find any appeal whatsoever in Discovery. The biggest flaw for me, that has been pointed out a bunch of times already is the quality of the writing or rather the lack thereof, which has gotten much worse with season 2. Not only do the characters suffer from it (""The power of math (everyone claps)"", ""I like science""... My admiration to the actors who have to say these lines with a straight face) but the overall story as well... It is just so incredibly convoluted and... dumb. Can anyone even give me a clear rundown of the season 2 plot that connects all the story beats in a logical way without going into heavy theorizing as to why certain things even happened? I'm having a hard time just remembering aspects of episodes that I just watched, because the explanation for certain things is just the worst kind of techno-babble or not even considered. It feels as if the writers introduced  elements of mystery just for the sake of mystery and hoped the people who watch would ignore it in the next episodes. Also everything is about Burnham, the most uninteresting character of the show. Give the other characters we know practically nothing about (like the two women at the helm) a little more room to develop! Let the show breathe a little! There doesn't have to be action and a timer ticking in every episode! 

The one thing I can say for the show is that it looks gorgeous, but even that has diminished over the season 2 finale, where they just overdid with the amounts of shuttels, ships and pew pew that is happening. I also liked a few episodes in the first half (for example the Saru's home planet episode) but the second half and especially the finale were just ughh...

So that go me thinking about the different similarities between the two shows.

- set on a space station some years in the aftermath of a major military campaign - Bajoran occupation vs Earth-Mimbari war

- Station has number in the name 

- Station is initially commanded by person with rank of Commander who is a veteran of a precious military conflict and carries baggage from that experience 

- Commander is key religious figure to the mythology of an alien race - Sisko is Emissary of the Prophets, and Commander Sinclair is Valan character of Mimbari mythology. 

- there is a powerful imperial species oppressing a weaker species - Cardassians vs Bajorans and Centauri vs Narns

- there is a period of Cold War against an existential threat to humanity ultimately culminating in an open conflict - the Dominion in DS9, and the Shadows in B5

- station becomes the center stage of said conflict 

- there is a side character named Dukat 

- in season 3 of both shows, they introduced a new nimble warship ship to make it easier for characters to leave the station. Defiant in DS9, White Star in B5

- the show ends with the fallout of the main protagonist sacrificing themselves to fight the greater evil due to incurring a “great cost”. Sisko sacrifices him self to defeat Dukat, and Sheridan has sacrificed himself to help destroy the Shadows, with their widows are left feeling their “presence”.

- strong female second in command. Major Kira vs Susan Ivonova 

As an aside, Robert Foxworth was supposed to be a regular guest character on B5 as the character of General Hague. But when he was due to make another appearance on the show, his agent had already booked him to appear in the two part DS9 episode “Homefront” as Admiral Leyton, so they had no choice but to kill him offscreen on B5. 

Apparently there’s a blooper reel of when Captain Sheridan asks “where is General Hague?”, and then Major Ryan replies, “General Hague is on Deep Space Nine.” Lol

Do you think a once a month show would work so the series is on our screens for longer?",1598404997,"Discovery had 14 episodes for its season 2. Picard had 10. The Next Generation had...TWENTY SIX.

Just as you're getting into a season of Star Trek (or indeed any TV show now), you're already at the end and have to wait until next year for more. I appreciate budget constraints and tighter story telling, but what if you just want to sit down and know that there's a Star Trek episode on that you've not seen yet? You can't do that year-round if you've only got 10 episodes to watch.

So, do you think a year-long series would work? What if it wasn't a weekly premiere, but a monthly one? What if the runtime was still 45/60 minutes, but a guaranteed 12 episodes a year? It's a longer wait than a week, but a shorter wait than a year to keep the story going.

What if it wasn't a 45 minute runtime? What if it was actually 90 minutes an episode? The budget would be bigger, but less than two separate episodes due to things like story-related set reuse and only producing 12 of them.

I think I'd be quite happy waiting four weeks for the next episode, especially if, for example, each one was actually a standalone story. Almost like a mini movie. And you got one of them every single month.

68,Discovery so far,1598404821,"I'm on to Season Two, a few episodes in. More thoughts. 

Still enjoying the show. Its only in Season Two that we really had our first episode that felt like the Star Trek that I'm used to where they land on a planet and deal with the planet's local dilemma. I gather this show doesn't want to do that sort of plot often, but I was hungry for it after everything else the show was serving me. 

But just because the show didn't feel like Star Trek to me didn't mean I didn't enjoy it. One of you guys recommended I enjoy the show as scifi, not as Star Trek and that's how the show has been working for me. Its definitely far from hard scifi but its passable TV scifi. 

One thing I appreciate after watching and failing to be engaged by Picard, is that most individual episodes of this show tell a complete story in addition to furthering the plot. Star Trek used to have A-plot B-plot structure. In this show the B-plot gets replaced by the shows running subplots that run between episodes which in some ways is a strength and in other ways is a weakness. Its a strength in that it creates a stronger guarantee of investment in that second track of plot even as you're enjoying this weeks A-plot which is the more contained story of the episode. The weakness, of course, is that you can't just pick a random episode of the show and watch it even though they're telling discreet stories most of the time. 

I really enjoyed Rainn Wilson as Harry Mudd. The payoff with the episode where he and Stanmetz were almost literally playing 4D chess against each other was a treat. Definitely a different spin on the Groundhog Day concept when you have two Bill Murrays fighting each other. 

I've been listening to SFDebris and I agree with a criticism of his regarding Michael Burnham where its not so much that she's a Mary Sue but that she's such a focus of the show and everything revolves so much around her character that if you don't like her character, the whole show fails. I haven't thought about to what extent that would be true with Kirk or Picard. Sisko I think you could definitely get away with not liking him and still like the show because the other characters got enough focus. And I feel probably the same is true for Janeway, especially once Seven of Nine enters the picture. Voyager focuses enough on its ensemble that you could get away with not liking Janeway if you like the other characters. Kirk shared the screen with Spock and Bones consistently so as long as you liked two of those three guys, it didn't matter if you didn't like the third I don't think. But Discovery doesn't have that. Discovery basically is Star Trek:Michael Burnham. 

Fortunately for me, I like Michael Burnham for the most part, certainly enough for the show to work. But I can understand people not liking her and its a real problem that ruins the show for those people because Michael is such a focus. 

I remember hearing that Christopher Pike is awesome. I'm still waiting for that to be the case. I think he's all right. Nice guy, competent, refreshing after Lorca, but he's not blowing me away. I'm not expecting superheroics from Pike, I'm just waiting for whatever it is that is supposed to make me really like him other than the fact that ""OMG! Its a TOS character on Discovery!""

Speaking of TOS characters on Discovery, while I haven't gotten to the episodes where he appears yet, I'm very much opposed to Spock being in this show. For starters, I've seen still shots of the new Spock and, in addition to being opposed to Spock having a beard on principle, its an ugly scraggly beard that detracts from Spock's dignity. Also, I have a nagging suspicion from what they've said about Spock so far that this is going to be character assassination, like what happened to Luke Skywalker in The Last Jedi. Yet another iconic character torn down. I will watch these episodes and if I feel they're doing this to Spock, I'll stop watching Discovery forever and reject it from my personal canon. I know that means nothing to any of you but that's just how I feel.

But while I'm watching that unfold, I have a question, or rather I just want to confirm something about Season One. 

Lorca was from the evil fascist universe. There was a transporter accident and then he was in our universe. I assume that this was a scenario like with Kirk where there was already a Lorca in our universe, presumably a more morally decent Lorca, who was part of the transporter accident and switched places with the evil Lorca. And this happened before the series started and that's why Lorca was always kind of creepy was because he was never the Lorca of our universe. 

I assume that it was this evil Lorca that abandoned and self-destructed his starfleet ship while in our universe prior to being assigned to Discovery. 

So do I have the above details correct?

Ok next bit of business. Why does Michael Burnham care which evil emperor rules the evil fascist empire. Philipa and Lorca are both evil and both fascist. She's downright depraved. The worst Michael has seen Lorca do is lie. Why would she care that Lorca is taking over.

79,How canon do you PERSONALLY take Discovery and Picard to be.,1598393894,"Let me start by saying I KNOW THEY'RE OFFICIALLY CANON.

But personally I feel like I don't take them that much to mean like in a star trek universe out there Picard ended up being an android now an android, or federation basic is actually what the federation goes by.

With Picard I think I take it, this is interesting if it turned out that way, like a hypothetical - what if. And with disco, I just pick and choose, like I don't accept ""believe or like process"" that Spock had a sister, but I do add in other things from it into my image of the Star Trek universe, like section 31 started of Starfleet sanctioned.

I feel like I pick an choose, sometime it's ""no no no, this is a bit too far"", and other times it's ""yeah I can see this happening"". Am I the only one who does this?

Maybe it's because these are modern, but with say TOS to TNG - they fit together perfectly - the same with DS9.

I thought it might be because Discovery is a prequal and because of retconing, but I didn't feel that way about enterprise (and even the future enterprise J, temporal cold war). But with the future, Picard also doesn't sit right.

47,Would devout Bajorans regard the DS9 cast with religious reverence?,1598312011,"One thing that strikes me as unusual, or insufficiently considered, about DS9 is that the Bajorans seem to treat Sisko's friends and family like fairly ordinary people. Sisko is somewhere between a prophet and a messiah for them, so shouldn't they treat the people close to him with enormous reverence? 

Christians have Joseph and Mary, and the Twelve Apostles. Muslims have the descendants of Mohammad, who are still entitled to honorary titles today, and the Companions of the Prophet (and they still have all the people from Christianity). It seems natural that, if someone is named as a prophet or messiah figure, that halo is huge enough to cover everyone around you. 

And Sisko was a much more private man than Jesus or Mohammad. How often do we see him deliver a speech, or publish his thoughts? If you want to know what Ben Sisko thinks about anything - and you do, about everything, because he is *the Messiah of your faith* - you can only come by that information from someone who's been working with him or hanging around him. 

So I feel like any Bajorans who really believed in Sisko as the Emissary would do whatever they could to get close to him - pretty difficult, he's a Starfleet captain. Still, we should've seen a surge in Bajorans applying to live on DS9 or even serve in Starfleet. But anyway, they'd also do whatever they could to share a few words or briefly touch anyone on the DS9 main cast. Kira should be absolutely inundated with requests to hear about Sisko or pass along a message to him, and Quark should be selling bullshit along those lines for a killing. And of course Jake Sisko's a successful writer - he's the Emissary's kid! Everything he writes must be considered mandatory reading for any true follower of the Prophets. 

Especially if the Bajorans know that Sisko's mom was a prophet. Now, my understanding is that Sisko is 100% ordinary human by DNA, that the prophet only possessed his mom in order to guarantee the conception (still fucked up!), so it's not like Sisko's kids inherited any prophet-powers. But you can't expect the Bajorans to engage their faith in such a cut-and-dry way; if any of them know that Sisko's mom was a prophet, then many of them will rationally conclude that Sisko inherited his mighty *Pagh* from the prophets and that he passed it on to his kids. 

To conclude, consider what sort of Bajoran might want to meet with Joe Sisko, the first and only man ever to sleep with a Prophet of Bajor.",startrek,SeniorNebula,False,/r/startrek/comments/ig0m3e/would_devout_bajorans_regard_the_ds9_cast_with/

51,Spock's failures in TWOK,1598306554,"I was thinking today about how Spock failed in TWOK, and how his failures lead to the death of a few crew members including himself.  Spock was the captain in command, and even though he deferred that to a flag officer, he was given the choice to do so or not, and I believe his choice to be in error.  This is in no way to absolve Kirk of his shortcomings, and he is responsible for the actions of all under his command.  But Spock made choices that mattered here.  Of course, all of this is my opinion from my own perspective.

When Kirk approaches him, the mission given to him is to investigate garbled communications with the distressed Dr. Carol Marcus on Regula One.  This mission is not one of great fleet tactical or diplomatic importance, and it is not known at the time to be a matter of Federation Security.  Kirk suggests that Spock remain in command for the mission.  This was a wise approach, as Kirk had once before taken command from a Captain who was more familiar with ship and crew, which almost ended in disaster.  Spock knew this as well, but decided that logic and protocol was more important than wisdom in this case.  He felt that the needs of the many (the entire ship) was more important than the needs of the one (his own need to command.)  This was in error, as he knew the ship and the cadets better than Kirk.  It was also not apparent that there was anything amiss that would require a flag officer in command, as Spock had no knowledge of Genesis at the time.

Later, on the bridge, Saavak quotes General Order 12 in response to a situation where another Federation vessel is running silent and approaching on intercept course.  This was a very wise application of GO 12, yet Spock reprimands her in front of the entire bridge crew for quoting regulations to a flag officer.  This in itself is very unwise to do, as any commanding officer needs to rely on feedback and viewpoints of their subordinates.  Doing this, Spock would instill doubt in anyone who would otherwise speak up later, as they would think they may be out of line.  I saw Saavak as not only communicating General Orders, but also underlining the anxiety not only felt by her but by the rest of the bridge crew as well.  Spock basically told her and the rest of the crew that their gut feelings and intuition didn't matter, the Admiral is in charge.  And, well, Kirk hadn't been in the captain's chair for too long, and his intuitions seem to have been a bit slow on this one.  I also feel that had Spock been in the Captain's chair, he would have been receptive to Saavak's quote of GO 12, instead of reacting to protect Kirk's ego, perhaps?

Uhura reports a voice message that says their chambers coil is overloading their comm system.  Spock checks and reports that their chambers coil output is normal.  This was a red flag for both Kirk and Spock, which Kirk failed to react to.  Again, to me this is Kirk's intuition being rusty.  I find Spock here to be too trusting, leaving Kirk time to choose, instead of recommending a course of action.  Another Starfleet captain would not lie about such thing, so this, in my mind, is a reason to go to red alert immediately.  It is easier to explain why you acted on GO 12 to another Starfleet captain than to fight an enemy on a hijacked Starfleet ship with no power, weapons or sheilds of your own.  I also feel that if Spock was in command at this point, he would have been quicker to react to the situation.

So in conclusion, Spock's failure was his inability to recognize the importance of keeping himself in command for reasons of familiarity with the ship, crew, and captains chair, and his failure in the crisis was to shut down input from the bridge crew and follow up that with his own example in the face of some serious red flags.  This lead to the death of one cadet and possibly more personell, (I'm thinking of the officer in the torpedo bay when it was hit) many injuries, and Spock's own life.  What are your thoughts?

Another point I will add is that Khan's confidence in his ""superior intellect"" is really arrogant considering that he only bested Kirk due to the sloppy mistakes of two very seasoned officers.  Had Khan initially faced off against Kirk on equal ground, and I'll grant Khan having another Constitution Refit in this scenario, he would have been handily defeated by someone who knows how to command a starship.  But perhaps Khan knew this going in, and that was part of why he made sure to try to catch Kirk unawares.  So maybe his superior intellect was to acknowledge his own inexperience.  It was his arrogant need to gloat over Kirk which allowed Kirk's experience and innovation to take away Khan's advantage.  Once he lost that, Khan was struggling to keep up with a ship he and his crew didn't fully understand, even against an Enterprise much more badly damaged.",startrek,SherpaJones,False,/r/startrek/comments/ifyzu1/spocks_failures_in_twok/

72,"Which one thing (Plot devices, 'not-shown' history, Ideas, Technology or similar) would you like to remove from star trek?",1598290613,"**Only, as stated above, Plot devices, 'not-shown' history, Ideas, Technology or similar. No removal of characters or historical stuff. Beta Canon could be stated too.**

&amp;#x200B;

Personally I would remove **INTERACTIVE time travel/manipulation**. Please read before you judge.

Time travel shows how fragile reality is. One tiny difference made mere seconds before could mean the life or death of a person, made years ago could affect the survival of an entire civilization, made centuries ago will affect entire planets, made millions of years ago could mean the end of life (demonstrated by the ever 'helpful' Q). Or maybe your mere presence billions of years ago may be enough to stop the galaxy forming, or even destroy the universe if made at the start of time. 

Let's say the person who changed this feels he is in error/guilty. He could go back in time and stop whatever change happened. But what if it was some species that was adversely affected by time travel made the change, such as the Iconians whose memory changes based on their time (see STO).

The only effective countermeasure would be being out of time or temporal shielding. Only because Archer was out of time and had some adaptable technology, was the timeline restored in ENT-Shockwave. And from beta canon sources, they have the technology to detect changes in time but not what exactly changed always, leading to possibly improper solutions. Also Temporal shielding is still considered a premium, only used for vessels in active time travel not for time monitoring or other passive time related activities.

But maybe this too drastic. Then at least we could employ some relatively minor ''solutions''-

* We could make it such that time travel creates alternate universes everytime it is employed. This of course would make the prime universe an alternate of......
* Or maybe we could make time travel impossible beyond a certain period (too energy intensive, health degrades, anything could be the reason) such as 100 or 1000 years (but longer the limit, greater the impact due to the butterfly effect). This limit won't apply to beings out of time (Wormhole aliens, Q, etc.) obviously (but I'll still have qualms about trusting my fate with them). This would ensure most Time related episodes won't be rendered destroyed/inconsistent/obsolete. 

So what do you think? Time travel should be removed or reduced or I'm wrong?

77,Dr. Leonard McCoy Appreciation Thread,1598287342,"I grew up on TNG, DS9, and Voyager. I watched a few episodes of the original growing up, the classics, you know- Tribbles, Space Seed, City on the Edge of Forever- but I never sat down and watched TOS all the way through. So a few months ago, bored, in lockdown, I thought ""Why not now?""  


So here's the thing. Everyone talks about how great Spock is- and he is! Nimoy is a great actor, Spock's a great character. And Shatner, for all his flaws, is a compelling and effective lead. But the beating heart of this show is DeForrest Kelley as Dr. Leonard ""Bones"" McCoy. He's the secret sauce that makes the show work. He's genuinely funny, even when the lines he's delivering aren't. Like pretty much every Trek doctor that followed him, he's deeply committed to reducing suffering and compassionate to a fault, but his compassion is at odds with his prickly, curmudgeonly shell.  His bickering, old-married-couple dynamic with Spock is the best relationship on the show. And Shatner is at his best in the scenes where Bones reminds Kirk of his humanity. 

There are many times on this show when it feels like Spock and Bones are like Kirk's shoulder angel and shoulder devil, only instead of good and evil they are espousing logic and compassion, each of which taken to their furthest extreme can be dangerous, and Kirk must find a way to toe the line to solve the problem. Every Trek show has its own similar dynamic, but imo none of them have replicated it successfully. 

As a person who until recently most encountered this trio through their pop-culture imprint, it saddens me that it's greatest member often seems to be its least appreciated. I see so much love for Kirk and Spock out there, but not enough love for Bones. He turned in a hell of a performance, and I genuinely don't think the show works without him.",startrek,Nofrillsoculus,False,/r/startrek/comments/ifsk4z/dr_leonard_mccoy_appreciation_thread/

80,One thing I'd like Star Trek to do is for once have the Admiral's on the side of the show's captain/commander,1598283930,"So I have only ever watched TNG and only some of the movies and some of TOS episodes. I love TNG. It's my favorite show ever, and recently I decided to watch all the other series, I am on DS9 now.   


One theme I keep seeing is the damn Federation High Command is never on the Captain/Commander's side. They are always just beuracrats or politicians with tied hands or bad news or shady oppurtunistic desires that don't align with the Federation's Philosophy. And then the show's captain has to stand up to them or take the risk they won't in order to save the day.   


Now, it is understandable that the Admiral wouldn't want to take the risks the captains do, but for once, I wish they'd write an episode that involved the desires of the Admiral's and Captain's aligning and working together. It would make the episode a little more epic maybe, increasing the size and scope of the problem to include more than just the destruction of the station or the wiping out of a colony or whatever. I always loved the episodes with the Cardassians or Romulans, especially the Cardassians in DS9, because it was always about the prevention of war with them. Including an Admiral with a more positive disposition toward the right thing to do would provide this.   


I remember one episode of TNG, can't remember the name at the moment, where they were fighting Romulans at the border, a standoff was occurring and the high command split up the leadership of the Enterprise to command their own individual ships in order to present a line of defense against the Romulans. Data captained one of these ships, but it wasn't the High Command that opposed his placement in that position; it was his subordinates. It was cool seeing him put his 1st Officer in his place knowing the Admirals backed him since Data was usually in the position of the underdog, having to defend his humanity to everyone but the Enterprise crew.   


Are there any episodes in the Star Trek universe that has High Command more on the side of the show's main characters? Without spoiling anything of course.",startrek,Ch_IV_TheGoodYears,False,/r/startrek/comments/ifrgnd/one_thing_id_like_star_trek_to_do_is_for_once/
81,Does the Trek Universe need a UN-equivilent,1598281430,"Although the UFP is in some ways shown as a Super-UN, down to its logo being a direct reference to the United Nations, it is a political union more akin to the United States. Members are expected to cede a degree of power and autonomy to the Federal Government, and expected to confirm to laws and standards that regulate the entire UFP.

This means that the UFP cannot provide one of the key functions of the real-world UN - acting as a forum where seperate sovereign parties can meet and hash out questions of policy or resolve disputes outside of one-on-one negotiations. Instead we most often see these issues being resolved piecemeal in workaround alliances or agreements between seperate powers, which can reuslt in situations like the Federation ceding occupied planets to the Cardassians, and the subsequent rise of the Maquis.

I'm not saying that the UN is perfect - far from it, but it does provide a useful platform for resolving international tensions without recourse to violence.

Does such an entity exist within the Universe of Trek, and if not, what would it look like? Can you imagine a forum where representatives from the UFP, Romulans (Empire Remnant or Republic, what have you), Klingons, Dominions, Cardassian etc. get around a table and have a chat. Even if these representatives and their parent governments are not always acting in good-faith, it would be interesting to see. 

I could easily see an equivilent to the UNSC existing within this body, where the major players get together to co-ordinate common defence against existential threats such as the Borg.

This Space-UN would also provide a platform where smaller groups that are not allied with any of the major factions could have a voice and make themselves heard. Membership would go a long way to ensuring smaller powers (or even individual unaligned planets) at least have recognition of their sovereignty.

One thing that I think can be agreed on is that this body should not be based in Sector 00 or anywhere near the Sol system. For better or worse the UPF does have the perception of being human-centric, and the Space-UN would thus need to be situated somewhere neutral where all the major powers can have easy access and no one entity can be said to have political dominance.

Weirdly, I could see Talgana-IV from Lower Decks being a good model for what such a neutral host body could look like. Governed under a neutrality pact where jurisdiction is administered directly by the Space-UN or shared between members, it would be easy to imagine regional 'districts' like Little Qo'noS springing up around the facilities of the Space UN, which in some ways would further any mission of discussion and co-operation by allowing for direct cultural exposure, trade, interaction and give-and-take between the citizens of the member polities.",startrek,rbdaviesTB3,False,/r/startrek/comments/ifqo6v/does_the_trek_universe_need_a_unequivilent/

TNG aired during my high-school years. In many ways I appreciate your many aspects of the series more now than I did then.

I think TOS was obviously a vehicle for social and political commentary, tackling a wide range of subjects, also at times pretty hard-core sci-fi in the mold of Arthur C. Clark, Harlen Ellison, etc. It cast a wide net, but I would say the over-arching theme was how humans deal with the unknown and ""alien"" and discovering the good and bad about ourselves in the process.

I think TNG's over-arching theme is less about social/political commentary/hard-core sci-fi and more about the human experience, personal conflict/growth, morality and the value of life in any form.

15,Transition from the TMP-bridge/TNG battle bridge to the TUC-Enterprise/Excelsior bridge set and the later TNG guestship bridges,1598221289,"I was reading up on set reuses in Star Trek and it's almost common knowledge now that the TMP bridge set on stage 9 was continously reused for all movies up to TVH and was also the TNG battle bridge and the Stargazer bridge in season 1 (actually the entire interior Enterprise set layout on stage 9 was practically unchanged from TMP to TNG [http://pat.suwalski.net/film/st-stages/stage9.php](http://pat.suwalski.net/film/st-stages/stage9.php)). But then, several things changed and it gets confusing: In TFF (late 1988, the Enterprise A bridge is significantly changed, as is the ""Starfleet guestship bridge"" in TNG season 2 (USS Hathaway). It's unclear if they are still the same set. This guestship bridge reappears as Enterprise-C bridge in S3 and the Enterprise-D battle bridge in BoBW II (S4). For TUC (late 1991) the Enterprise-A bridge changes again and the battle bridge set disappears from TNG. Guestship bridges are now always a redress of various other sets

&amp;#x200B;

For DS9 S1 and S2 a guestship bridge set was built on stage 18 used for the Saratoga, Norkova, Prometheus and Odyssey. This set uses the aft part (the small doors) of the Excelsior bridge from TUC which was a redress of the Enterprise-A bridge. 

&amp;#x200B;

For TNG S7 a guest bridge that resembles the Hathaway/Enterprise-C style from S2 and S3 is used for the USS Pasteur.

&amp;#x200B;

For Generations the Enterprise-A/Excelsior bridge from TUC is redressed to portray the Enterprise-B bridge and then the Amargosa-observatory. After this appearance, this bridge seems to disappear for good. The DS9 guest bridge still appears in S3 as Warbird bridge in ""The Die is Cast"", but disappears after that.

&amp;#x200B;

Only for VOY Flashback (S3) a new Excelsior bridge is rebuild which serves as Starfleet bridge in later VOY episodes (e.g. USS Equinox, USS Prometheus).

&amp;#x200B;

And here comes the question: Does anybody know the relationship between the Enterprise-A bridges and the bridges for TNG S2-4 (Hathaway, Ent-C, D-battle-bridge)? The layout is significantly different.

&amp;#x200B;

TNG-bridge:

Hathaway: [https://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/\_\_cb20121204031204/memoryalpha/en/images/b/bd/USS\_Hathaway\_bridge.jpg](https://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20121204031204/memoryalpha/en/images/b/bd/USS_Hathaway_bridge.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

Note that those bridges have distinct wedges in the aft ceiling that are absent in the Enterprise-A bridges.

Enterprise-A:

&amp;#x200B;

While the TMP-TVH bridges and TNG S1 bridge are clearly recognizable to be the same set, this is unclear for the later bridge set(s?). Where they actually distinct sets or redresses of each other? Did they occupy the classic location of the old TMP bridge on stage 9 or were they errected on other stages? What about the Pasteur-bridge? It looks similar to the Hathaway/Ent-C-bridge but why was it absent for several seasons?

&amp;#x200B;

There also seems to be some confusion as to why both the TFF-bridge and the TUC-bridge were rebuilt from scratch. A ""freak weather event"" was cited to be the reason for both rebuilds:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The Enterprise-A bridge is mostly a new set, except for the turbolifts, Sulu and Chekov's helm console, the handrails, and some of the platforms on which the portions of the bridge stood. According to the Collector's Edition DVD text commentary, a new bridge set was necessary due to the original movie bridge set being mostly damaged by a sudden windstorm while in temporary storage at the Paramount studio parking lot (other sources have the reason for the new bridge set's construction as being because it had been extensively modified for use on TNG to the point that it could not be converted back), and only those few pieces used on the Enterprise-A bridge were salvaged from the original set. ([https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Star\_Trek\_V:\_The\_Final\_Frontier](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Trek_V:_The_Final_Frontier))

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;One of the major reasons Meyer could not budge from his budget was that there was one of the most expensive sets that absolutely had to be built, and that there was no way around it: the refit-Enterprise bridge set. The original set had a few months earlier been temporarily stored on the outside studio parking lot, in order to make room for other sets. A freak weather event completely wrecked the set beyond salvation, save for some parts such as the two turbolifts.

19,Coming to the end of my first Trek series,1598216373,"I have been exposed to Star Trek since the day I was born, since TNG was in its prime and my dad was a life long fan, but I was never able to get into it. I think as I grew up, I enjoyed the conflict based sci fi more or just... Didn't get it. 

I tried, and I never doubted it's greatness or importance. Growing up, I had Star Trek toys from Little Tikes all the way up through action figures and immaculate ship toys. The Christmas tree at my dad's house has at least 1000 dollars worth of Trek ornaments. He has a bookshelf full of guides and novels all relating to Trek. I even loved the Abrams movies. 

Then this year at 27 years old, in the middle of unemployment due to Covid, I started episode one of TNG for the third time, and just sat and watched. And then watched episodes 2 through 5. And then watched seven more episodes the next day. I finished the first season the day after that. I just couldn't stop watching, something had just clicked.

Yeah the first two seasons are a little hammy and pervy, but like everyone says, they're so optimistic. I needed that so much, since it took forever for Ohio to finally give me my unemployment. TNG was a godsend to me this year, and I slowed down in seasons 6 and 7 because I just don't want it to be over. 

But the beauty of it is, I know there's more great Trek left for me to watch. Months worth of Trek, good or bad to go. New series, regardless of quality on the horizon. And to top it off- my dad's my best friend. Always has been, regardless of the fact that I only got to see him on weekends growing up. This has been magical for both of us, as I would talk to him about my favorite episodes so far, and we would talk about how TNG changed the face of television forever.

Other highlights: 

* Spock and Michael's farewell - her last advice to him set up the entire rest of his life. And Spock's advice to never mention her again both cleaned up the continuity issue and had high stakes considering how he feels about her 

* Georgiou kills Control - like her, I loved watching that bastard die screaming. 

* The Enterprise heads off for it's next mission - it was a signal that this dark period in Federarion history was over. And what a fantastic lead in to Strange New Worlds!  

* Spock shaves and puts on the uniform - anybody else think that Ethan Peck has become a better Spock than Zachary Quinto even though he doesn't look as much like him? 

* As Michael led Discovery into the wormhole, was anybody else cheering ""GO GO GO!""?

23,Telling the origin story of the Borg civilization would’ve been a better choice for a gritty and dark series.,1598211940,"I’m one of those fans who prefer the hopeful and optimistic views presented by the original series and TNG. That being said, I understand that Star Trek as franchise has the ability to tell a vast number of stories in a way that don’t always cater to my personal tastes.

One of my biggest complaints about the new shows is the continued focus on the same characters, races and events that have been covered so many times before - so much attention has been paid to Klingons, Romulans and Vulcans, and while they should still have a part in the story, they are so familiar that the sense of Discovery (pun intended) is gone. Alternate timelines have the same effect of retreading already familiar ground of the characters and events we’ve known about for decades.

I’ve felt for a longtime that the Borg would lend themselves really well to the gritty and dystopian story telling that is present in Discovery, and to a lesser extent, Picard. I imagine something in the vein of the remade Battlestar Galactica. I’d imagine that the first instances of technology being integrated with biology would have been done with noble intent but that as the integrations progressed a core group of Borg would form a resistance against the threat to individual identity. The goals of society would gradually shift for a desire for safety, convenience and societal harmony to ambitions of expansion and domination. There seems to me a very fertile ground for a nuanced and philosophical examination of some very interesting themes.

Does anyone else agree that the Borg offer an opportunity to tell a fresh story in a more “mature” manner?

Full disclosure: I have not read all of the books or other extended universe material. I imagine that the beginnings of the Borg may be covered there.",startrek,-Pak-Man-,False,/r/startrek/comments/if9st4/telling_the_origin_story_of_the_borg_civilization/
24,"""Following Gene Roddenberry's ideals"" isn't an opinion, nor is it a sign of an good or bad Trek",1598211764,"First off let me say I'm not here to discuss if any of the shows are good or bad, merely the idea of Roddenberry's ideals as they apply to Trek. It may seem like I'm giving some shows a harder time, but that's just because they have more ""darker"" elements.

There's been a lot of talk on weather or not modern Star Trek is staying true to Gene Rodenberry's ideals and vision of a future. And about how it isn't and that makes it bad Trek. This has always annoyed me, not because I believe any one series is more true to those ideals then any other, but because I don't think the argument makes sense.

Gene Roddenberry (or Gene, as people who are tired of typing ""Roddenberry"" call him), famously had some pretty strict and often unusual ideas. Thanks to the TOS and TNG bibles, as well as stories from people who worked with him, these ideals are INCREDIBLY well documented. Perhaps the most well documented ideology of any fictional world in existence. Therefore it should be very easy to look at a show/episode, look at Gene's ideals, and say ""hey, this does/doesn't match up"". Are the human crew in conflict with each other? Doesn't follow his ideals. Do we use money/material based economies? Doesn't live up. Are we prejudiced? doesn't live up. Do people spend much time mourning a dead friend? Doesn't live up. (There's one of the odd ideals I learned about recently.)

And when you follow that practice, every single Trek falls short of at least some of his ideals every now and then. McCoy is uncomfortably racist twords Vulcans. (replace ""green-blooded, pointed eared"" with human equivalents""black-skinned, slanted eyed"" and then be appalled at his behavior). TNG has 95% of it's admirals. Deep Space Nine (set an a space station, another no-no) regularly has humanity or Starfleet officers as the bad guys. They use racial slurs (spoon-heads), attempt a military coup on Earth, and are offten portrayed very poorly (AR-558). Voyager has the equinox, Enterprise has Archer torcher and steel to find the Xindi weapon. Discovery has the Federation attempt genocide (oh ya, I forgot about Section 31 until now). Picard has... well just about every new character plus Seven in that series. (Lower Decks has only 3 episodes so is sitting pretty good, but theirs still conflict between characters/family and swearing).

So when Alex Kurtzman sais he is sticking close to Gene's ideals in interviews it infuriates me, but not for the reason it makes others angry. True I don't believe he is and I think that's easily provable. But also because it's not the end-all-be-all.

Deep Space Nine is not a feel good show. I re-watched it again recently and sometimes found myself asking why. It often didn't uplift me and it's latter stores and tone are often depressing as F\*\*\*. I believe in the early planning, just before he died, Gene was vehemently against DS9. It does not stick to his ideals in basically any way. In many places it can be as dark and bleak as Discovery or Picard. I also love Deep Space Nine. Why? Becouse of the times I can awnser why I watch it. The Visitor, In the Pale Moonlight, Damar's resistance speeches, the Cardassians, broken and defeated, lamenting about their lost culture and power. Deep Space Nine is a perfectly written show which clearly shows careful planning and forethought sometimes seven seasons in advance. This is all despite the fact there was zero planning and forethought, even in the final arc. We (broadly, not everybody) are much more forgiving and lenient twords Deep Space Nine's bending of the rules becouse it's writing and acting is all increadable, deep, and thought provoking.

As for everything else pre-2009 we arn't as harsh on it because it's the classic optimistic space ed venture style of show. When those shows stray a bit from Gene's ideals it's a bad episode or an inconsistency among the 150 better episodes.

Discovery and Picard still suffer from not being optimistic (there are plently of people who don't like Deep Space Nine for the same reason). But ""optimism"" isn't a rule of Gene's but a byproduct of most of his rules. In theory you could write a story where everybody is TNG-perfect that's depressing as all heck. Remember that Voyager one where they were all actually goo people? What about the one where The Doctor creates a family? My eyes started to water just typing that.

Where Discovery and Picard really suffer is that they bend or flat out break Gene's ideals *without the perfect writing of Deep Space Nine*. I'm not here to say it's bad, just that it isn't fantastically amazing. One of the most common complaints against the shows is that their plots don't make a lot of sense or are full of holes/inconsistencies. And I think the majority of people, if they really sit down and examine them, will find that that is true to some extant in a good portion of the main overarching plots. We are much more forgiving of the contents if we are impressed by the quality of a product, and right now most people aren't impressed. Think of the JJ movies. I pretty common review of them among fans is ""perfectly competent and alright movies that aren't great Trek."" Nemesis and Insurrection are often called action movies because they arn't bad, but they don't really hit that ""Trek spot"" for some people. Ignoring Trek for a moment, Discovery isn't a bad war story either.

I still believe optimism is important to Trek, and a lot of Gene's ideals not only help reach that but are very important to Trek as a whole. But can we stop focusing so much on weather something follows those specific ideals and instead focus on if a show is portraying it's universe and characters in an interesting, entertaining, yet still Star Trek way?",startrek,Official_N_Squared,False,/r/startrek/comments/if9qxl/following_gene_roddenberrys_ideals_isnt_an/

Even seeing Worf work together with the new chief would have been cool. plus would the new person have been with the rest of the senior staff to help Picard save the Ba'ku?

34,"DS9 - S06 E18-19 A flawed captain, or bad writing?",1598197467,"Episode 19 of season six is a first person narrative of Capt. Benjamin Sisko's actions leading up to the Romulan's involvement in the war against the Dominion. Before Capt. Sisko erases his personal log, he lays out the lies and deception leading to the deaths of everyone onboard a Romulan Warbird. 

The episode by itself is fantastic performance. I just can't find myself sympathizing with Capt. Sisko. He says he can live with his actions, ""Because I can live with it"". This is such a stark contrast to other Star Fleet captains and the previous episode. In episode 18, Dr. Bashir tells Sloan that, ""... the ends don't always justify the means"".

I find it hard to believe that it is a coincidence that two episodes back-to-back share such a similar theme. In both episodes, principles are broken for the greater good and no consequences are to be found. TNG's The First Duty comes to mind where Capt. Picard tells Wesley, ""... if you can't find it within yourself to stand up and tell the truth about what happened, you don't deserve to wear that uniform"".

I just can't extrapolate the message of episode 19. Are the writers trying to tell us principles are worthless? Is this episode purely to paint Capt. Sisko as a tragic hero?

38,Long Time Star Trek Fan Finally Watches Voyager: season 2 episodes 1-4,1598191935,"The 37’s: Of course Tom is into cars. 

I’m sorry to keep harping on this because I love Janeway’s optimism but seriously, SERIOUSLY how did she think they would react?

I was so ready to tell you guys how boring this was but I honestly almost cried when there was nobody in the cargo bay. I mean, I knew there would be nobody in the cargo bay, but still. The way Paris looked at the captain when she got back to the bridge just melted me. That said, the rest of it was a lil boring (if they wanted to settle on a planet.... why not just pick a planet?) so let’s talk characters.

Tom’s my favourite. He’s the most complex and interesting to me. B’Elanna has what is supposed to be “Built in” complexity because of her conflict between her Klingon and Human side and it just doesn’t work for me. Tom has the conflict against trying not to become his father, while also respecting the uniform and being very good at what he does. 

Chokotay, while not the most interesting, is super even handed and I respect most of his choices. This is the same for the captain, although to her I would add that she is wickedly cliche sometimes and that feels like nails on a chalkboard to me. I love her optimism but MAN.

I loved Kim in the first few episodes but he’s fallen off the radar. I love Tuvok but that’s partially because he is essentially T’Pol before she got addicted to trellium and I loved her. I’m waiting to see something unique about him. The one thing I have seen is that he very clearly values his friendship with Janeway, which I respect. I respect a lot of the characters on this show before I like them, which is a new thing for me in Star Trek. The characters feel honorable, and their values are well defined (and then they actually seem to stick to them). 

I love the EMH. He’s still a bit of an ass but it’s working for me. For those of you who didn’t read my DS9 blogs, I tend to lean into the medical/science officers, because I am a scientist with experience in the medical field, so I identify with that set of characters. I try not to be too heavy handed with it but come On the holographic doctor is awesome. I don’t love Kes and Neelix is straight up annoying. 

The amount that I’m calling something boring on this series is a little sad to me. The parts I like, I really like a lot. There just seems to be a lot of stuff in between that we don’t really need. 

Initiations: So the Kazon are essentially Klingon 2.0. 

Paris reminds me of Wesley if Wesley’s life had reversed and he moved away from Star Fleet first and then joined up later. And was a little more loose cannon. Something about him is just very young but very good at what he does. He’s not even a main part of this episode. 

Yet again, I love Chakotay’s character. I love his values and what he was willing to do for that kid.

Projections: I love the conversation around what is real and what isn’t. They keep using the word “real” as if the holograms aren’t real. They are to them. 

Also hey! Haven’t seen reg in awhile. 

The EMH is very real to me. It’s like when Odo decided that the little girl hologram was real and refused to let the dude turn her off completely. Just like the way these shows are real and personal to us. I also love how Kes compares the question of whether or not the holographic program is real to the question of what is our purpose. Because who we are is defined more by what we do than whether or not we are solid. 

Elogium: oh boy here we go with the crew members’ indiscreet fraternization. 

Oof Neelix makes me mad, the way he treats Kes. This happened when his lungs were stolen. He used the words, “I trust you, I don’t trust him!” which is one of the most disgusting things I hear on a regular basis. I find it legitimately, viscerally disturbing. And Kes is so sweet. Just a beautiful soul. She doesn’t deserve this. That said it made it all the more jarring when she just... shoved a handful of beetles into her mouth... almost as disgusting as Neelix’s attitude. Oh, MY GOD HE SAID IT AGAIN. 

Man we’re really asking the tough questions here. I don’t want kids, I’ve never wanted kids. So I get why this is such a difficult conversation to have so quickly. 

Why does Star Trek like to do episodes about desperate, intensive mating rituals? Is anyone else uncomfortable? I’m uncomfortable.

46,I've come to like Star Trek: The Motion Picture even more recently,1598185899,"To start off, I'm still pretty new to Star Trek, I've watched the series as a whole in a weird order. I started with TNG in 2017, then VOY, DIS S2, Nemesis, PIC, and then the other movies. (I'm on the last season of DS9 now). 

At that point, I loved everything I had seen except TMP, Insurrection and Nemesis. I found TMP especially boring, but recently I decided to rewatch it. A couple of weeks ago I watched Ad Astra, and I really liked it. It's quite a slow paced film, but I tend to like slow paced sci-fi movies. The long stretches of silent moments, and slow pace reminded me of TMP, so I decided to rewatch it again yesterday.

It is so much better the second time around! I really enjoy how different it feels to the other movies, I don't know if 'Hard Sci-Fi' is a good description, but I like the approach they took so much more. I know everyone likes to joke about the 46 minute long space dock scene (It is a bit too long lol), but I like how it helps establish the size of the Enterprise, it really does wonders for setting a sense of scale to the ship, and how small the ship seems at the end of the movie with Vger.

 I also really adore the soundtrack to the movie, the music of the Klingon attack at the start, the electric sounds of Vger, everything just sounds sooo good. The visuals also are much better than I remembered, the ship models are really cool, the matte paintings are mostly good as well, with a few poor exceptions. Everyone in the movie wears pyjamas though, I guess starfleet has a 'Wear your PJs to ~~school~~  work day'.

I think one thing that some people may disagree with me on is the acting, I think it's actually quite good. I always heard that Shatner was a bad/overactor before I saw star trek, but he seems just fine to me. I've only seen a handful of TOS episodes, like balance of terror, and the one with Khan, and his acting in those are pretty decent too. I'm not saying he's the best actor ever or anything, but I don't have any issues with his work.

&amp;#x200B;

I think if you didn't like the movie at first, maybe give it another shot! I may be a bit biased for loving slow paced Sci Fi, Blade Runner is one of my favourite movies, but I think it's a lot better the second time round, I know there is a directors cut but I haven't seen that one, perhaps that version is even better.",startrek,Sion1314,False,/r/startrek/comments/if2dj3/ive_come_to_like_star_trek_the_motion_picture/

So I thought it'd be fun to try to get Trek to place somewhere in the chart (which plays out over the 3 days of Aug bank holiday weekend btw)

So if you get a chance, and if you fancy being put into the prize draw, and if you want a good showing for a Trek soundtrack, please could you click the link and 

vote for the *Star Trek First Contact* soundtrack

(You can ofc vote for anything you like, but if we all vote for the same one - which is gorgeous - we'll stand a better chance of placing higher)

48,"Just watched TNG S5E17 ""The Outcast""",1598180065,"I just finished watching this episode and it got me really worked up, it's a really tragic story, and was shocked when I looked up some discussion of it which criticised it heavily.

Aside from some language and notions which are a little dated, but still present today, the biggest issue that everyone seems to have is that they *want* it to represent something and aren't happy that it is done just right in a way that represents modern issues. 

If you're looking at it from a social perspective, I think this episode is great for exactly this reason. It's not directly about gay or trans issues, and criticising it because it shows someone who leans towards traditional gender roles misses the point I think. It's a story about someone who was born differently, who should be able to be comfortable in who they are, who is repressed by their society, considered sick, and forced to go through awful 'conversion therapy'. If you try to directly correlate it to gay, trans, non-binary issues, then it can be considered clunky, but instead it is all of them and none. Lots of people can relate, see aspects of their struggles, or perhaps the repression they take part in, and relate to it in some way, reflect on their attitudes.

Some have criticised the ending to say that it is trying to teach a moral, and is therefore justifying the actions of the government. I couldn't disagree more. It's not teaching a moral, it's an absolutely tragic end that got me way more emotional than most episodes. They 'got to her', they took something different and wonderful, and killed it, presumably through some form of brainwashing of which they would undoubtedly be capable. It's very sad for all involved, especially all the others like her. I empathised so much with Riker, the anger and helplessness he must have felt as the grips of this society claimed another victim.

So I think you can get hung up over the specifics of how sexual identity and physical sex works in this culture, over comments of how women wear lipstick and men don't, and the fact that Riker didn't know to say 'they' rather than 'it', but I think in doing so you're missing a pretty emotional standalone story to which many different groups can relate. It is, after all, a story about enforced normalcy, where the bounds of acceptance are dictated, and anything that falls outside it are considered 'sick'.

**Star trek: Federation's Fall**

*The funny thing about star trek was it revealed that many of the member world's and cultures were precisely not what I would call federation material. Some enslaved part of their own populace and yet that was considered who they were, and kirk and picard allowed those cultures to continue as federation members.*

*So a series that deals with inequality and striving to build something better seems counter to the tolerance of inequality.*

*So let's see a series with a protagonist who must deal with the inequality, and yet have tolerance of inequality imposed on him: let's have a young Benjamin Sisko.*


*Chadwick Boseman seems to have that young Ben Sisko quality. So we can have a series about a difficult personality rising through the ranks, fighting inequality and the Federation's tolerance for it in its member worlds.*

*And while it would be difficult to sustain a single character arc development through eighty plus episodes, it's something that might be important enough to undertake.*

*Is the federation's tolerance of inequality in the guise of tolerance of diversity something that will destroy it from within? Only Sisko's Rise can give us those answers.*

78,Why is Picard (seemingly) considered the ‘best’ Star Trek captain?,1598126370,"First let me just say I’m bias in that I think DS9 is the best Star Trek and I strongly prefer Sisko as a captain to Picard. I also haven’t watched Picard yet.

So why is Picard the most popular captain?Personally I think it’s because Patrick Stewart is so popular but I want to know your thoughts.

I have some thoughts about Picard as a captain that may be unpopular but I want to rant and hear your thoughts on my observations. 

I don’t deny that Picard is extremely intelligent (probably the most intelligent captain) and has strong ethics. I personally have some problems with his leadership style. He’s extremely withdrawn from everyone except his senior crew. I didn’t like that it was a big deal that at the end of the series he finally sits with his senior crew for a card game. In 7 years he never hung out with his senior officers? Does he even interact with the rest of his crew? He comes off as the kind of boss who’s door is always closed and is too intimidating to approach. 

He seems incapable of forming intimate relationships and the few times that he does he becomes very needy. I also don’t think he displays much willingness to compromise with a romantic partner. This is why I think Beverly rejected him, he’s too obsessed with the idea of being married to his ship to form any real relationships. 

I get that it’s too painful to be in a position that may lead him to send his lover to their death but there are over 1000 people on his ship and they aren’t all Starfleet. If he actually spent time with other people he probably would have met a civilian that he could have formed a romantic relationship with or at least made a friend. 

He also doesn’t have any strong family connections. He finally reconnects with his brother but even then he doesn’t have great relationship with him.

This may not be a big deal to you but I think he’s inability to form romantic connections, spend social time with his crew, and to maintain family relationships is not a good trait for someone in charge of sending people on dangerous missions.

He’s never sympathetic to the needs of his crew who have families and relationships. Correct me if I’m wrong but he’s kind of an asshole to his crew when they are struggling with family issues. I always got the impression that he only cared for his ship, his senior crew, and the idea of life on a large scale. How am I supposed to trust a captain who doesn’t seem to value his crew members on an individual level? Who doesn’t feel it’s important to socialize with those he leads?

Anyway it’s been a little while since I watched TNG so maybe I’m focusing to much on specific instances and forgetting others. I also don’t have anyone to think I don’t like Picard, I do!

82,"The creation, existence &amp; even the naming of the ''Kelvin timeline'' creates a myriad of problems.",1598119342,"**\*RANT ALERT\***

**BTW This was written in jest, so (probably) don't take this seriously.**

&amp;#x200B;

It is said that the kelvin timeline was created after events were changed in 2233 by Nero, causing the timeline/universe to split into 2 versions.

But according to all other time travel episodes shown, time is fluidic and it changes in the present and future with respect to what happened in the past (and removes all evidence about what history was before.) But then by this Kelvin timeline can't exist.

And the only thing lost if the kelvin timeline was a universe will be the certainty of the existence of red matter in prime timeline &amp; Spock's death. We've also shown (PIC) the Romulan supernova occur in both 'universes' leading to little or no change to prime timeline.

And don't say it's a ''quantum universe''. Quantum in star trek is a freaking placeholder not some legitimate thing. See Quantum torpedoes- In alpha content, they just have a higher yield than photon torpedoes: whereas only in Beta Content does it have at least some roots in reality, showing that it uses [Zero Point Energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-point_energy#Purported_applications) (Starfleet finds unlimited energy, and what does it make with it...weapons).

And what on earth is a quantum universe, a universe that exists subatomically? Sub-atomically w.r.t what? Us? Then we may very well have virtually infinite universes within our own universe (or maybe it is a universe within the singularity in a black hole...then did the big bang really happen in our universe or was it a ''supernova'').

Or maybe it's created via quantum effects...But then it follows the same laws as our universe and has similar events to ours. Which means its either an alternate universe or a different ''timeline'' of our universe, which it probably is due it being called the ''Kelvin Timeline''. Back to square one then.

Instead of changing the New movies' settings to Kelvin Timeline, they could've either left it as JJverse or Abramverse or at least renamed it as Kelvin Universe. But the one word 'timeline' is enough to create this many problems - 

Also the opening sequences tells us that a black hole is a transporter (if the singularity isn't a universe itself) to some time (Nero,2233) but also transports to alternate universes (or timelines), which means a single atom can change/create a universe (God...).

But there are 2 possible solutions (each with their enormous problems to ST Time Travel) &amp; 1 convoluted solution(the only one that doesn't destroy previous Time Travel Logic) -

1. The many worlds interpretation is true (i.e each time a choice (whether seen or unseen, voluntary or involuntary, etc) exists, the universe splits to accommodate all possible options.) Virtually infinite universes.
2. Time travel causes alternate universes (one solution of Bootstrap Paradox), which technically means we are in an alternate of alternate of alternate of....... Universe (due to amount of time travel seen).

Or maybe the convoluted solution (Way more exotic but way less contradictory) is the one-

The Universe exists in a state of superposition with all possible timelines existing &amp; not existing at the same time. That means the Kelvin Timeline, Prime Timeline, Broken Janeway Timeline, Year of Hell Timeline, Nazi Earth Timeline, ''Non-Timetravel'' Timeline, Tapestry Timeline, Parallel Timelines, etc technically exist &amp; do not exist all at once.

This is basically Schrodinger's cat (the cat replaced by the universe) with how you see it determining what timeline the universe collapses into. We're the observers, the events we choose the lens (determining the timeline), and our universe the exterior of the 'box' in which the ST Universe(s) exist.

This can be seen by temporal shields &amp; the timeship. Temporal shielding removes voyager from the ''box'' and makes it an observer, unaffected by different lenses. Whereas the timeship has the power to change the lens (i.e events), effectively making the universe collapse into another timeline.

So whenever we see a ST show, movie, etc; we collapse the ST universe into a timeline based on the lens we use (i.e the timeline chosen is based on the events &amp; continuity of the show/movie we chose). This also means both timelines exist simultaneously so the first Capt. Kirk (Kelvin) as well as the third one (Prime) exist simultaneously in the same place in the same time in the same universe.

Starfleet had people who were able to transmit and bring back knowledge of the weapon and its capabilities, while I'd assume that the Breen weapon would knock out a cube completely with one hit and render all systems and all drones useless without getting a good reading of the weapon and how it works.

I actually like Michael Burnham. I don't think she's an OP character after hearing all the complaints. I do think she's talked up a bit but she's not really out of line with Spock or Data and this is a universe where there are humans with psychic powers (its been a long time since Star Trek did an episode about a human with psychich powers but that is canon) Sisko was the Emissary of the prophets so sure, Burnham, in spite of being human, can be a Data/Spock level genius. 

Three gripes. Two are bundled under the general category ""I hate the new Klingons."" I hate how the Klingons look, I thought their TNG era makeup was fine and looked better than this.

There are species that the Federation encounters that have abilities that seem like magic but the Federation itself has no abilities that aren't grounded in the plausible. That plays into Gene Roddenberry's optimistic vision of the future. We can achieve Utopia through science and understanding not magic. A mushroom powered super warp drive is magic. 

Besides which, why isn't it being used? Maybe its turns out not to be appropriate for general use but why didn't, say, Capt Janeway, or Seven of Nine, revive the spore drive research to help Voyager get home?

97,Long Time Star Trek Fan Finally Watches Voyager: Season 1 episodes 13-15,1598105926,"I am blowing through this series, I really like it. Some parts are a little slow but when it’s good... they nail it.


Faces: This species is a perfect villain in a lot of ways. Creepy, disgusting, and desperate. Oh God when they killed Durst to wear his face...

I wasn’t super interested in the whole “B’Elanna’s internal conflict became external” plotline. I did find it a little callous when Chakotay was comforting her in sickbay and then just up and walked away dramatically when she started crying. I feel like that was not the right way to handle that situation. 

This is one of those episodes where I’m not quite sure why Paris was included, except that watching him, he seemed to almost fall in love with the human half of B’Elanna. It’s like he saw her completely differently in that moment. But that species is so interesting, I wish they had done more with them. I mean, the whole face stealing was jarring. But then they were not used well after that. With all their superior technology they just sort of froze up. 

Jetrel: this episode feels like it is trying to have all of the complicated conversations DS9 had but in one episode. We touched on collaboration,  war crimes, guilt and redemption after the war, whether or not both sides are guilty of something, cowardice, etc. DS9 did this so well because they had so much time. No matter what else happened, Bajoran patriotism and the Cardassian occupation were going to be central. They could take time to have more complex, even handed discussions, and what they ended up with is art. This feels rushed. Voyager has plenty of unique topics that they could take the time to explore (the main one for me is, “At what point is naval discipline no longer valid, and we should take on a more democratic or otherwise negotiate a new command structure?” Because I don’t think that these people should have to live out what for many of them is the rest of their lives taking orders, especially since they COULD have gone home had Janeway not decided to save another species. Noble, but not entirely her choice to make). 

Yeah I didn’t trust this doctor guy. If this was going to work why didn’t he just explain what he was doing.

I love when Star Trek talks about forgiveness. I have so much to learn about forgiveness. I think the world has a lot to learn about forgiveness. I think it’s something we should talk about more. So I love the message of this episode. 

Learning Curve: I. LOVE. DISCIPLINE. For those of you who read my DS9 blog, I am a sucker for consequences. Yay for enforcing the rules!

Chakotay is so balanced and even handed. I absolutely love his character. Screw it, you want to be treated like that? I’ll treat you like that. And I love watching Tuvok train the Maquis people. I love it when superiors do the training with their trainees. He gave them a physical challenge, he did it with them. A lot of management, pretty much everywhere I’ve ever worked, has a lot to learn about that. Want to tell us how to run this? Come run it with us first. I understand that management and leadership experience is important to those roles, but so is the baseline, grunt work experience. I work in labs and don’t care about doing the all the boring, time consuming stuff (namely washing beaker after beaker...) because I know that everyone above me has gone through the exact same thing. It’s important and I think it builds us up at people. You go, Tuvok. Turn that gravity up.

You guys might think this is funny because of how much I love discipline but I actually hate uniform/dress codes. I’ve never followed one beyond what is needed for safety. Does it really matter that she had a headband, or the Bajoran officer wears his traditional earring? Didn’t we deal with that in TNJ? I just don’t see any point in not wearing comfortable, functional clothing. Whoever came up with dress codes that involve suits was a jerk. I love the Star Fleet uniforms but they must be so HOT.

I loved this as a season finale. No recurring aliens, no big blowout space battle, just working hard at a long standing conflict on the ship. And the gel pack thing but that was so boring to me compared to Tuvok teaching the Maquis to be better officers. I just enjoyed watching that. If I had joined the military out of high school, that’s one uniform I would have tolerated and been proud of. I am a big fan of simple, stand alone episodes with a solid message and this one was excellent for that. Probably one of my favourite Star Trek episodes. It wasn’t as deep as some of my other favourites (Nor the Battle to the Strong from DS9 and the “There are four lights!” episode from TNG [you guys have told me the name of it four times and I STILL don’t remember, sorry]). But it gives more of a tribble vibe, except without the punchline, and I am all for it.

Mariner is obviously very experienced and capable, but it also seems like she might have trouble making friends with her peers; if part of the reason she acts the way she does is that she constantly feels the need to impress the people around her, it could be interesting to see what happens if her circle were to learn she's not quite everything she presents herself as.",startrek,USSBurritoTruck,False,/r/startrek/comments/iee5cx/mariners_record_of_service_spoilers/

11,Another reason to love Lower Decks,1598077828,"RED ALERT! SPOILERS INCOMING

Watched the 3 released episodes today and I'm loving it. Besides the many reasons I saw posted here, one that stuck with me is the discussion of the differences between TOS and TNG.

On here we got ensign Mariner, wich seems to have signed up for Starfleet chasing for the adventures and frontier exploration like the fabled captain Kirk. Instead, she got stuck with the more political and rule restrict TNG era. This can be clearly seen on the last episode, where she gets all excited when the crystal people round up around the away team with lances, even exclaiming ""this is Kirk era, I like it"" or idk I don't really remember lines that well. This is a clear contrast to commander Ransom, Wich plays himself as the old time hero, but actually is much more of a Picard (I'd also compare him to Zapp Brannigan in some ways).

And her expectations are clearly way different than the other Ensigns. They are much more enthusiastic about science, engineering and rising on the ranks than on adventures and playing the hero. Ensign Tendi os excited about holding a heart on the first episode, Rutherford about being in the Jefferies tubes for days on the second and Boimler about having a very productive day on the third, while she hates everything about being a functional part of a TNG era crew and finds herself on her element when stranded on alien planets or having to deal with trials by combat. It's the kind of shit she signed for, but she doesn't get.

I'll love to see how it plays out on future episodes, and how those characters develop. They have a strong writer on the team, that came from Rick and Morty, a show with interesting character developments, and who seems to be an old time Trekkie.",startrek,_demello,False,/r/startrek/comments/iednb3/another_reason_to_love_lower_decks/

14,Lower Decks is the Perfect Opportunity to bring back Q,1598073601,"When Picard was announced, there was a fair amount of talk about potentially seeing Q again. However a lot of people dismissed it because John de Lancie has spent the last few decades aging. How rude of him. As Q is immortal and doesn't age John de Lancie cannot play him again (this is despite Q appearing old to taunt Picard in All Good Things and could be explained away in a line. ""I have an *undeserved* reputation for childish games and tomfoolery. I figured adding a few years to my MAGNIFICENT human appearance might help change that"". Boom done, old Q. But what do I know. Q would kill Picard's tone anyways)

But the point is, as an animated series, John de Lancie's appearance doesn't matter in Lower Decks because he still sounds like Q. The animators can draw him however young he has to be. Sure his voice may have changed a tiny bit, but you don't see people complaining that C-3PO sounds a bit older in the new Star Wars films because it's still clearly the voice it's supposed to be.

After realizing this I think the perfect Q episode writes itself as Q and Lower Decks comedy is a great mix. Imagine dealing with all of Q's tricks with absolutely ZERO idea what is happening on the bridge. It would be insane!

Mariner would want to meat Q as she's read about him and thinks he's cool. Boimler thinks he's a menace and gets in the way of smooth starships operations. Q overhears this, and makes sure Boimler is constantly harrased by completely random things that break protocal (in minor ways) and prevent him from working. Meanwhile Mariner keeps having a perfectly normal and boring day and Q makes sure she never experiences anything unusual. She only gets to clean up after Q. In other words both are having each others ideal day.

Tendi is in sickbay dealing with all the wacky injuries by herself. This is becouse T'Ana was given the brain of a common earth house cat and her behavior is not helping.

Rutherford's Vulcan implant surpresses his emotions but nobody can fix it becouse engineering is dealing with the fact the laws of physics are breaking down. So he goes around in that irritated Vulcan way complaining that everything is illogical to his endangered crewmates (but not helping of course)

The Captain thinks this is her big chance to prove herself to Starfleet Command once and for all. After all every other captain to encounter and best Q has become a great hero. After all Q only shows himself to the best. She is so caught up in all this she ignores her captaining.

Shaxs tries to punch his way to victory for half an hour. But Q doesn't care. Shaxs may also be really small or weak.

Ransom can be there too I guess. Not really sure what to do with him as we haven't seen much of him yet.

In fact given how easily this episode seems to write itself, and how the writers have repeatedly said they are basically just taking what they love about TNG and going ""let's do that"" I'm very surprised I havn't seen this mentioned before. I would be very (pleasantly) surprised if this was some secret thing given how previous ""cameo-episodes"" have gone in other series. I guess the Enterprise in Discovery was a surprise though. What do other people think about this? Has this been brought up and shot down before and I just missed it?

17,The Lower Decks cast are believable personalities for any Trek show. Change my mind. [SPOILERS],1598070270,"A lot of the backlash Lower Decks gets comes from saying the tone of the show and the behaviors of the characters are too immature and unprofessional to realistically represent members of Starfleet. Except with every episode we see, the more realistic it becomes.

The thing to remember is that the Cerritos is an unimportant ship. Prior to this series, we've only ever seen ridiculously important ships. ENT, TOS, TAS, movie-era TOS, TNG, and movie-era TNG are all following the story of literally the most important ship in all of Starfleet. OFC we're going to see the most professional and talented members of Starfleet on board. You wouldn't get a posting there if you weren't among the best and brightest Starfleet had to offer. Then there's Voyager and Discovery, which take place on brand new top-of-the-line ship classes. That's still going to be staffed by A+ tier crewmembers. 

Finally, we've got DS9, but remember how that started off: since it's set in the ass-end of the Alpha quadrant, Starfleet puts a measly Commander in charge of an entire station instead of a Commodore or at least a Captain, and a friggin' non-com in charge of engineering! Early Bashir and Dax are the least professional-acting members of Starfleet we had ever seen up to that point. Literally the only reason it wasn't more akin to Lower Decks' dynamics is because Sisko had a point to prove, not unlike Freeman, and because the show revolved around him instead of the unimportant people under his command. 

As slapstick-ish as moments have gotten on Lower Decks, Mariner was quickly shown why she behaves that poorly, and everyone else not being on par with what we've seen in other live-action shows just makes sense: they're not good enough to get postings on better ships or under better commanding officers. They're the nobodies because they're typical, not superb. 

It bothered me that we haven't seen anybody ranking below an Ensign yet, but even that makes sense: the ship is so unimportant and small that it makes it a perfect entry-level job for junior officers. These kids aren't the best to come out of Starfleet Academy, they're the ones who graduated with shitty GPAs, but still managed to graduate.

As for the senior staff, they're your typical management staff at an unimportant branch of a large corporation. Are they the best for the job? Nope! But they're good enough. Ransom really is ""a Riker type,"" just not as impressive as early TNG's Riker. Shax (I spelled that wrong) is essentially early TNG's Worf's personality, just without the brains. The result is that Worf gets on the Enterprise as a Lieutenant Junior-Grade, whereas Shax gets a full lieutenancy but on an unimportant ship.",startrek,DayspringTrek,False,/r/startrek/comments/iec4ld/the_lower_decks_cast_are_believable_personalities/

I get the seasonal mating part. BUT, Vulcans are not fish. The reason this kind of mating strategy works for something like a fish is because they have a LOT of offspring when they mate. But I would imagine a Vulcan being more like a human in that they tend to have 1 child at a time. But considering how rare the Pon Farr seems to be it seems like Vulcans would have very few children. With this in mind, it kind of seems like the Vulcans would have died out, or at least have a VERY small population...

21,Spelling/pronunciation in Klingon,1598064399,"I went on a bit of an adventure today, looking up the letters and pronunciations and some words. I love how this language sounds. However, I found some discrepancies and want to know what you guys think. Yes, yes, we've all had the Kahless/K'Ehleyr discussion, with plenty of answers, and even a new ""qeylIS"" spelling, so I won't go into those.

This started with me and my coworker joking about my Klingon name. When my little brother was very young, he always called me Ga' (with apostrophe, because it was an emphatic ""ga!"") even tho that sounded NOTHING like my actual name lmao. Well, perhaps you can see the problem here. When I started my research, I discovered that there is no standalone ""hard G"" sound in Klingon! Well, shoot dude.

That led me down a path. What about Gowron? Chancellor Gorkon? The dish called gagh? I found \*one\* short discussion about the latter, where they said it should be ""qagh"". Fair enough, but then should that be universal? In proper tlhngan Hol, should those then be qawran and qorqan or perhaps qorQan to keep the original g/k type difference?

What about other absent letters? Where did the F in Worf come from? There's no similar sound to replace it. One I found interesting was bat'leth. There is no TH sound, but tlh is kind of close. Should it then be bat'letlh?

Obviously a lot of this is going to be ""well, they made those names/words before there was official rules"" but I wanna know how they would fix it, like they did with qeylIS. Back to my silly discussion with my coworker, would I just say screw it and name myself Ga', or go with a more accurate qa'?

On an extra note, this also got me wondering how a Klingon accent would sound. I've been trying to do it, but of course since I'm new to making these sounds, it's difficult. It's fun tho, cuz afaik we don't hear anyone speak English in a Klingon accent, uniquely influenced by their native language!

Like Star Trek but in universe funny as opposed to (in my opinion)the forced or crass funny like The Oriville. But my biggest issue every scene and by proxy character in a scene is written as a bit for maximum comedic effect, and thus doesn't bridge the gap well reality  (with some absurdist sci fi elements and) situational comedy and cartoonish level Rick and Morty or Futurama style insanity and character decision making. Also with these quick laugh a minute sequences they're not seeming to mark time for slower character focus and personality development/ exposition,  which is an element of classic trek (that old trek fans are used to and love) and that new trek fails to   grasp thoroughly. Bad character writing ( as in characters are not written in a way you understand their decisions) besides bad/ haphazard plotting seems to be the silent killer of new trek. That's just my two cents though. I like / want new trek stories,  I just want them to be good / more thoughtfully exceuted. 90's and early '00 non serialized but well continuitied TV writing ( and well excuted season finales) seem to be a lost art.

39,Lower Decks finally got me to start watching the rest of the franchise,1598044987,"Ive always been semi interested in Star Trek, Especially as an episodic sci fi, a genre I am very attached to, but have never felt particularly pushed to start watching any of them. Even knowing they're all on Netflix. I even tried watching it on TV once but it didnt grab me enough to finish the episode. Im not entirely clueless on the topic, I have seen videos on it and all that.

But being a big animation fan, I watched Lower Decks episode 1 and enjoyed it, and it was finally the push I needed to start the rest of the franchise; I decided to begin with TNG. I know people say it starts rough but I still decided to start at episode 2 (a lot of episodic sci fi starts with movie length stuff dont they). I chose TNG because I figure I'd approach it like classic Doctor Who, where I get acclimated to  a more recent part of the franchise before going to the very beginning (like watching the Third Doctor before going back to the first two). Im not gonna binge it since I dont binge things but it will be fun basically watching LD and TNG side by side.  


A few notes:  
Ive always heard Code of Honor was bad, but was surprised to find out its just episode 3? That really puts things into perspective for people writing off Lower Decks after 1 episode.

I assume after TNG I should watch the original, but I have no idea where to go after that (and I assume answering this is going to cause an argument I should apologise for in advance).",startrek,chloe-and-timmy,False,/r/startrek/comments/ie5my2/lower_decks_finally_got_me_to_start_watching_the/

I've been wondering especially since the last episode where he seems to be making a point to be the living up to Starfleet ideal as much as possible, he seems to be actively seeking heroics, and he refusing to allow his subordinates to get into a life threatening situation to the point of injuring them. 

It kind of tracks that he's trying to come out from the shadow of his infamous relative (maybe brother)'s reputation and probably secretly figures he would be a captain now if not for the Ransom name hence his drive to prove his worth.

70,Long Time Star Trek Fan Finally Watches Voyager: Season 1 episodes 10-12,1598012093,"State of Flux: Seska bothers me. Chakotay has earned my respect over and over again. 

I’d love to hear your thoughts on Chakotay’s character, as well as what the consensus has been in the community regarding how theY portrayed Native Americans. I had thoughts on DS9’s discussion around race but this feels a little more intricate, and is just not something I know anything about. But regardless of that whole conversation, I respect the way he respects the captain, while being strong enough to insert his own opinion. He has very strong values that I personally align with. 

Nucleonic particles and radiation are becoming cliches on this show very quickly. Cheers to Torres for nor letting Janeway give her unrealistic timelines. 

Well at least I was right to let her bother me. She has that sickening Cardassian quality. I feel so bad for Chakotay. He cared so much about her, was very even handed with his suspicion of her while still trying to trust her character. I love Tuvok, as well. Funny that there were two spies on that ship and neither of them noticed. Also a very creative plot because I would have never guessed there would be a second spy. 

We’re gonna see Seska again, aren’t we?

Heroes and Demons: I love Janeway’s understanding of science. She can figure out what’s going on, follow the stuff in engineering, and help when needed. 

I don’t love holodeck episodes. I liked them in DS9 at least some of the time but really not in Next Gen. But of course, this was fantastic. The EMH is hysterical. I do find them more entertaining when I am familiar with the work they are based off, but that isn’t the case here. I’m just laughing at the EMH just trying to pick up a sword. I love the idea that the holographic program that has human limitations because his creator did. Zimmerman was scrawny, hologram based on Zimmerman is scrawny. Hologram is lonely, gets bored, is easily frustrated, has moments where he doesn’t know what to do. He doesn’t have to panic and give sedatives out all the time but he does, pretty frequently. But even the physical traits. No reason he can’t have super human strength, right? But he doesn’t! I also love his conviction. “The only reason you won’t die is because I took an oath!” 

And look at Paris being a backup engineer! 

Cathexis: these types of episodes are so creepy. I loved the solution, that Chakotay’s consciousness was displaced and he had been trying to save the ship. Also liked seeing Torres respecting his wishes and going through his ritual, and then the EMH encouraged it instead of dismissing it for his own medicine. Tuvok was super creepy. It also seemed like they were getting angry at each other for being possessed. 

There were some really well choreographed scenes in this episode, like the one where the alien bounced between them and they were playing shoot or punch out the right person until Tuvok just shot all of them, which I didn’t know those phasers could do.

I'm an old, salt and pepper ""El Tee"" (prior enlisted) and used to write software during my enlisted days.  The latest episode of Lower Decks reminded me of the very worst commander I ever had.  I was in a squadron that's purpose was to test upgrades to an airframe.  My job was to solicit ideas from the unit on software solutions to stuff being upgraded.  Enter: Capt Punk.

Capt Punk was my element leader, the dude in charge of the software element. ""Buffer time"" is sort of a thing in the military, but not to sneak margaritas.  The purpose is more to give realistic expectations. If I told a superior it would take 3 months to research, write, and test a piece of software and my boss told his boss that's how long it'll take, then if it takes 3 months and 1 week, my boss looks bad to his boss.  But Capt Punk was the type that said ""how long will it take... 3 months? youv'e got 1 week"".  And in the software world, that produces buggy, unusable, hacked programs.

He was trying to pad his resume (so to speak) for promotion.  We were trying to tell him ""this will take 3 months realistically, otherwise, you'll have a broken product in a week, and we'll spend the next year trying to fix it while people are frustrated tyring to use it!"" Our back talk didn't sit well with him.  So he ordered us to log our hours in a notebook DOWN TO 15 MINUTE INCREMENTS. We'd have to log when people came in and talked to us, breaks, programming time, everything.

It was, by far, the most miserable time in my 18 years in the service.  One of the guys in my shop decided to get out of the military.  The other was written up so many times by Capt Punk that he was denied re-enlistment, but I managed to weather the storm and commission as an officer despite his horrible leadership and I like to think he at least taught me what NOT to do.

In your quarters, that you share with a neat-freak roommate, you're talking to a friend about how strict everyone is on the *Enterprise*. You go on to say you ""still haven't felt right since you got over *Barclay's Proto* \-- *proto* \-- ***Barclay's Spider Syndrom***. And I need a change.""

Your friend says they have an opening on his ship -- and you should put in a transfer.

The next day you give your transfer request to your high-ranking, very type-A, supervisor officer. Think 7 of 9 in *Workforce* level efficiency. He approves it.

You pack your things and walk into the transporter room. The attendant tells you to wait a moment.

She transport's in Geordie and begins walking down the steps.  As he starts to walk out the door, he stops, turns around and says

""**The Cerittos, eh?**"" with a friendly grin.

You just say ""**Yes, sir.**"" and give and friendly nod.

89,Borg Canon/Headcanon Problem,1597979867,"Hi folks, sorry if this has been asked before, but here we go.

The Borg first make their appearance in “Q Who”, in 2365 (according to Memory Alpha).

Guinan knows about their existence, for obvious reasons. However, it’s clear that there is no reference for them in any Starfleet database, and no Captain-level of clearance that would have otherwise informed Picard if their existence was known, but a closely-guarded secret.

Flash back now to 2293. The Enterprise-B goes to assist two ships transporting El-Aurian refugees to Earth. Kirk then shows he can do more than punch his way out of a problem, pushes buttons and unplugs a couple things to save the day. Then poof, he takes a vacuum nap, but this gives us Guinan, whose home world was just destroyed by the Borg.

So let’s take a hard stop here for a second.

The comms officer identifies the passengers as refugees. Refugees from what? Refugees from a destroyed world.

Did no one ever stop and ask, “Hey, what happened to make you refugees?” Or, “What destroyed your world?” 

(Or is there an immigration checklist, like “please check the box corresponding to the space disaster that most closely matches your personal situation.” “Let’s see... giant green space hand, evil ice cream cone that eats planets... I’m gonna check “other”.)

I have a hard time believing the El-Aurians would say nothing about this pretty monumental threat.

I have a much easier time believing they, and anyone else with knowledge, would have been sworn to secrecy (in the same way Discovery’s nonexistence in the canon was retconned in Season 2). Because the Borg were scary as hell.

That being said, was this all decided ahead of time? Did the Federation work this out once the El-Aurians contacted them for help, said “Help us, and also, the guys that kicked our asses will eat you for breakfast”, explained the enormity of the threat the Borg presented? And then the top brass thought, “this will probably panic people, let’s keep a lid on it.”

Then again, the comms officer already knew they were refugees before they arrived on Earth. So either they really screwed up, admitting they were refugees, possibly prompting the “refugees from what?” question, or since the galaxy is a big place (looking at YOU, JJ. Space is BIG), so maybe it wasn’t questioned, and accepted at face value because there’s always going to be some kind of crisis in the galaxy. “Oh hey, more refugees, maybe it was a giant green space hand.”

So... who knew what, when, and how much did they know?

That one stupid line by the Enterprise B’s comms officer is problematic, in my mind. She could’ve said any other word except refugees, and I would’ve also been okay with the idea of the El-Aurian survivors keeping the Borg a secret, something decided amongst themselves, to try and save the Federation from going “sounds cool, let’s go check it out”.

I’ve gone too far down this rabbit hole already. Help me.",startrek,Achromatikon,False,/r/startrek/comments/idp1ux/borg_canonheadcanon_problem/

91,My opinion on Star Trek Lower Decks,1597977260,"I like it. It feels like a return to the TOS/TMP-era of Trek. In the VOY episode Flashback, Janeways says:

They were a little slower to invoke the Prime Directive, and a little quicker to pull their phasers. Of course, the whole bunch of them would be booted out of Starfleet today. But I have to admit, I would have loved to ride shotgun at least once with a group of officers like that.

This statement right here describes Lowers Decks to a T and I love it, and I also love the posts made about Mainer's character and how she should be punished for her blatant disregard for the rules and protocol, well, it's a comedy show people, Mainer's disregard for rules and protocol makes Lower Decks worth watching because it's similar to how the TOS crew operated, remember when Scotty told Geordi in TNG Relics to never give exact ETAs to the Captain, alway say 6 hours and have it done in 3 hours instead, that's how Scotty made his reputation as a miracle worker.",startrek,ardouronerous,False,/r/startrek/comments/idoej8/my_opinion_on_star_trek_lower_decks/

She just seems to be a nice, ethical person (like you would want from a doctor lol), but she always feels like she on the sideline and never dominates a scene by herself.  All the scenes I distinctly remember about her are just awkward romance scenes or scenes where she's just kind of there like the dancing doctor with Data (which is only memorable cuz of Data).

0,I'm a convert...I like Voyager,1597969546,"For years I have always professed my disdain for Voyager, thought of it as the worst series in the Trek universe. I had only seen the series once when it aired and my memories were of bad CGI and nonsensical alien races. Needless to say that decades later my opinion was low and I could care less about its place in the overall universe.

Fast forward to two weeks ago and I have a badly injured ankle and can do little else but lay in bed on my back. I had recently finished my favorite series DS9 and TNG before that and was looking for something to keep me occupied while I laid there. I decided after all this time I would give the show another watch, if for nothing else than as a time waster while i drifted in and out of sleep.

Two weeks later and I'm almost mid way through season 6 and I'm really enjoying it. There have been a couple episodes that were stinkers and a few alien races with bad CGI, but what trek series doesnt have a few of those. My favorite example of this is probably the two-parter Equinox. A great story and a cool cameo from Titus Welliver but the aliens look like bad CGI from some type of SNES Ghostbusters game, lol. Also, I'm a huge fan of Trek ship battles and this series has a lot of great ship fights. Its also made me a big fan of the Intrepid Class of ship. I feel like the ""biopacks"" was a marketing gimmick but thankfully it plays a miniscule part in the show.

So, to sum it up, I like Voyager a lot and I would recommend anyone whos in the same position and hasn't watched it in a long time to give it another shot.

46,"LD: I love Mariner, and Starfleet needs people like her, but...",1597939925,"Having had a few episodes to get to grips with Beckett Mariner, I'm wondering if anyone else feels the same way as me.

Starfleet NEEDS people like Mariner to push back against hierarchy. Not only because a system that becomes too rigid and inflexible can easily stagnate or collapse, but because Starfleet so often seems to swallow its own PR about being the best-of-the-best. If it wants to indeed be more than just the defacto military of the UFP, then militaristic aspects such as strict rank, hierarchy and shipboard discipline need to be regularly challenged and questioned*. I accept that a ship cannot be run as a democracy, but a system that claims to be one of exploration, diversity and celebration of difference, but which in practice comes across as military, homogenized and hierarchical needs to be regular challenged in order to confront itself and ensure it doesn't veer into authoritarianism.

HOWEVER, that doesn't mean I want to give Mariner a complete pass. I love her ethos and wit, but she often takes it too far. Her rolling-up of the sleeves is a perfect example of her getting it right - it is her own customisation of the standardised look and a subtle defiance of the uniform code, but doesn't involve her coming to work in (for example) her underwear or banana-pyjamas. 

Where she gets it wrong is her disregard and (frequent) contempt for people who don't match up to her own standards, and this is what I find frustrating about her. Mariner teaching Tendi about Buffer-Time and sharing margaritas with her friends is Mariner at her best. Mariner shoving Boimler offstage at the talent contest (""wrap it up, nerd"") or bragging about how great she is, is Mariner at her worst.

What I think/hope the show is doing is evolving/teaching Mariner to move past her abrasive tendancies, while still embracing a need to challenge Starfleet and its dogmatic tendancies.

* I wonder if Starfleet having a constant low-key self-identity crisis (trying to reconcile its mission statement with its defacto military role) could in part explain why they're constantly redesigning the uniforms.",startrek,rbdaviesTB3,False,/r/startrek/comments/idd89x/ld_i_love_mariner_and_starfleet_needs_people_like/

I argue the Producers would not bother showing us this unless it meant the former.

I've been saying for some time Borg membership is inevitable, since Janeway handed their ass to them in Endgame.  The Collective is hitting the limits to assimilation, and expansion by force will no longer be logical.

In fact, voluntary assimilation of selected Borg components will probably become reasonably popular.

56,Long Time Star Trek Fan Finally Watches Voyager: season 1 episodes 6-9,1597926531,"Eye of the Needle: again, honestly, what was Janeway expecting when she tried to tell someone they were that far out? Surely, there must have been a more gentle way to approach that situation. I love her optimism but she has a sort of brute force tactic that she isn’t learning from and it isn’t working for her. 

I really should have seen the time difference coming. So cheers to the show for being more creative than I am. I don’t have much else to say about this episode. None of the characters really shined, except Kes for standing up for the doctor. And awe, all he really had to do is ask for respect. 

Ex Post Facto: no but really, did you cheat on the guy’s wife? Tuvok is asking the real questions here.

I love the concept for this episode but Star Trek is just not good at murder mysteries. Look, he’s the same height and the dog is friendly with him!  But I loved Tuvok as an investigator. Very reminiscent of Odo. He was focused on the truth
and justice, not on saving his crewman, and I appreciate that. 

Honestly, I’d be really interested in an episode like this where the officer was actually guilty. Then their CO’s would actually have to deal with those consequences. 

Emanations: Man the EMH just really loves giving up and sedating people. 

I love every part of this. I love Chacotay’s intentions and respect for the dead of alien cultures. Yet I love the irony when that backfires and they asked Kim for biometric data. I love that, yet again, Janeway thinks that waking up someone who thought they were dead, from a culture of unknown level of development, was going to go well. I adore her optimism but at this point, it’s naivety. Okay I loved every part of it except traveling half a light year in about a second. If it were that easy... I’d love to say I’m not gonna let that bother me every time they do it but of COURSE IT’S GONNA BOTHER ME.

Kim up and forgot the prime directive. I don’t blame him, he was pretty confused. But he woke up and went, “Hey you guys left all these dead bodies on this asteroid over there.” I like the way they showed the people struggling the afterlife. These people are disturbingly consumed by the thought of death.  

And we went straight from a conversation about “Where do we go when we die,” to a conversation about physician assisted suicide to this dude’s family trying to kill him. 

I really like that they look at everything scientifically but gently. 

Prime Factors: I gained a lot of respect for Torres  in this episode. Of course, the part where she disobeyed orders repeated was painful. But the way she reacted to it, the way she responded to peer pressure, is commendable. She isn’t a completely trained Star Fleet officer. We can’t expect her to behave like one 100% of the time. I was expecting her to start talking about Klingon honor but she just said she wanted to be able to live with herself. I think that’s more fundamental than her species. I think it shows remarkable growth. She isn’t just maquis anymore, she almost seems proud of the Star Fleet uniform. It’s like when Picard taught Wesley about honesty.",startrek,MrPotato2753,False,/r/startrek/comments/id9cdx/long_time_star_trek_fan_finally_watches_voyager/

**Episode 3 - ""Temporal Edict""**

* ""This is the first time we've seen an electric guitar in Star Trek"" is what I *would* have said if some nerd on Memory Alpha hadn't pointed out the electric guitar in the wedding band in *Nemesis.*
* It's unclear whether the Klingon Bird-of-Prey is hearing the bass over the comm signal or through space. If the latter, it might denote the first time that Trek's trope of showing sound in space actually affects the plot.
* As the bass shakes the *Cerritos,* the captain's coffee mug rattles on the table next to her, a potential allusion to the beginning of *The Undiscovered Country* when Sulu's teacup is shaken to the floor by the explosion of Praxis.
* The initial destination of the *Cerritos* is Cardassia Prime. Introduced in ""The Wounded,"" the Cardassians were a major antagonist in the back half of TNG and throughout DS9. A war between the Cardassians and the Federation took place offscreen, and a second conflict arose during the Dominion War which ended with much of the population of Cardassia Prime being annihilated.
* The tactical officer behind Freeman could be a Hailian, introduced in ""Aquiel.""
* The design of the brig mimics the design in TNG.
* Rutherford explains the ""Miracle Worker"" strategy of exaggerating the time needed to finish a job. Scotty admitted to this tactic in *The Search for Spock* and later tried to impart it onto Geordi in ""Relics.""
* Boimler sounds like he's humming the TMP/TNG theme in the turbolift. The only other theme music heard ""in canon"" is the PIC theme which originated in ""The Inner Light.""
* Among Boimler's reported tasks is inventorying Cargo Bay 4. This is the same task given to Nog in ""Heart of Stone,"" and Nog seemed just as happy to do it.
* Boimler also claims to have performed a baryon sweep of the warp nacelles; this procedure was performed on the *Enterprise* in ""Starship Mine.""
* The LDers blame the loss of Buffer Time on ""Delta Shift,"" implying the ship has four duty rotations. A four-shift rotation was attempted by Captain Jellico in ""Chain of Command"" and by Kira in ""Accession.""
* The ""something bad is about to happen"" alert chirp heard during the crew's initial meltdown is taken from TNG and VOY.
* Ransom's list of potential away team maladies include
 * Horned gorillas - a reference to the Mugato of planet Neural in ""A Private Little War""
 * Sentient tar - a callback to Armus from ""Skin of Evil""
 * Spores that make you hook up with your best friend's sister - not an apparent reference to any particular occasion (outside of Ransom's personal book of excuses), but spores did mess with the crew during ""This Side of Paradise.""
* The crystal landscape of the Gelrakian homeworld is reminiscent of Gamma Tauri IV, the last outpost of the Tkon Empire.
* Mariner's enjoyment of being surrounded by spears like ""Kirk"" in ""the 2260s"" evokes the many times the OG captain fell ass-backwards into trouble on planets throughout TOS.
* On multiple occasions in this episode, characters spout colorful metaphors, but they are bleeped out. It's possible I didn't notice this happening in previous episodes, but otherwise I do not think there has ever been a ""bleep"" in Star Trek.
* Mariner has a scar from Magus III; this is where Guinan got the phaser rifle she showed off in ""Night Terrors.""
* Scottsdale has never been name-dropped in the franchise before, but Arizona was featured in ""Future's End.""
* Ransom applies the famous Trek combat move of ""clasp your hands together and bring them down on your enemies because the only thing more powerful than a fist is two fists.""
* The music heard during the duel shares elements with the iconic TOS fight music.
* The Boimler Effect plaque is the same design as the starship dedication plaques typically seen on bridges.
* It is not clear how far in the future the ""far future"" is. VOY, ENT and DIS all depict eras centuries after the main events of the franchise and this scene could potentially fit in any of them.
* A Borg is among the students, suggesting relations between the Alpha Quadrant and the Collective have thawed.
* Boimler is depicted alongside ""one of the great birds of the galaxy."" This mysterious creature was invoked as part of a blessing in ""The Man Trap,"" and offscreen is a nickname given to Gene Roddenberry.
* The most important person in Starfleet history is Miles Edward O'Brien, the perennial everyman and always-dependable transporter chief of TNG and later the chief of operations on DS9. O'Brien grew from a glorified redshirt to one of Trek's most prolific characters. He likes real meat and no-win scenarios, gets jerked around a lot, and as of this writing is currently floating in space waiting to die so that he can be resurrected by Wesley.",startrek,Antithesys,False,/r/startrek/comments/id8r2h/canon_references_temporal_edict_spoilers/
58,Why I believe Lower Decks' comedy is an insult to Star Trek,1597923924,"Here is my problem with Lower Decks and why I think it's an insult so Star Trek. It's an insult because the Starfleet officers in the show are behaving worse than children. Now, I'm not against humor, I know Star Trek has plenty of humor in it and that's fine, I enjoy it. However, the way they made these officers behave is not fitting of Star Trek in any way shape or form. You may say that these are fresh ensigns and that they are allowed to goof off, but we see even senior officers behave the same. We also see in the actual Lower Decks TNG episode how lowly ensigns actually behave off duty and on. They are mature and respectful and behave like 24th-century Starfleet officers. This show is having us believe that a Federation starship is not much more than a 5th grade classroom. I'm not against humor in ST, but I feel they're making fun of ST with this show, just like a parody would.

My point is that you can't fundamentally change what Star Trek is in order to get a younger audience to like Star Trek. It's not Star Trek anymore... People should like it for what it is. I grew up watching all of the older series and I liked it that way as a kid, with serious issues and proper humor when appropriate; if you don't like Star Trek for what it is, don't watch it. Yes, this show is funny, but this is not how we have seen 24th-century Starfleet officers behave. Starfleet and the federation were originally written to be mature and advanced, not to behave like children. This show cheapens ST and makes it abandon the mature and advanced ideologies that are the cornerstone of the ST universe. Ultimately I believe this is just a blind cash grab by CBS...",startrek,mx1701,False,/r/startrek/comments/id8qsj/why_i_believe_lower_decks_comedy_is_an_insult_to/

64,"Did Voyager get new writers during season 4, or something?",1597913402,"I'll try to keep this brief: I'm pretty new to Star Trek. I watched half of TNG on Netflix and thought it was okay, a friend got me into DS9 and I loved it, and then after that I went back and finished TNG with a new appreciation, and then decided to move onto Voyager.

Voyager in my opinion is...not great...for like its first three seasons. It doesn't seem to be able to decide whether or not it wants to be TNG or DS9, and in trying to be both at the same time it ends up being neither. There were definitely some surprisingly good episodes tucked in there still (even in season 1, stuff like Jetrel and Faces were great), but overall the show was just sort of...beige. Not truly awful, but not really good, to me, either.

Then around the end of seson 3 and for all of season 4, just...*wow*. Not only are the stories more interesting (they finally stopped trying to destroy Voyager or kill the entire crew every single episode), but the writing seems to have been spiced up as well. The characters are actually interacting with each other and acting like people, the actors are getting a chance to show off their chops and display actual connections and friendships and emotions to each other, rather than spouting off whatever drab lines the writers shoved into their mouths.

Maybe I'm just drunk (and I definitely am), but I've done a total 180 on Voyager. I'm about halfway through season 4 right now, and if they can just maintain this, the show is gonna end up being a lot more appealing to me than I thought it would be at the start.

76,DS9 Overrated?,1597890908,"I've seen all the love that this subreddit showers on DS9, but I personally do not believe the show merits such adoration. The most consistent praise for DS9 is that the main characters are fleshed out and they have satisfying character development compared to the other series. Undoubtedly, there are several strong character relationships - the father-son relationship between Ben and Jake Sisko and the bromance between O'Brien and Bashir come to mind - but many of the other characters fall flat, especially in the later seasons. Quark was one of my favorite characters in the first few seasons, and the idea of having one of the main cast being a non-Starfleet-issued shady bartender was a genius idea. It seemed like he was steadily becoming more and more human the longer he was exposed to the crew on DS9 - his scene with Garak perfectly exemplifies this, the more root beer you drink, the more you get used to it. For some reason, Quark hit a brick wall in Seasons 6 and 7, and his character actually began to regress for no good reason. Instead of getting an enlightened Ferengi Chad, we get a bigot who throws a temper tantrum when Moogie and the Grand Nagus begin to reform Ferenginar. Odo was perhaps my least favorite character in the main cast. He was always pouty whenever Sisko brought another security officer on board and whenever he was ignored by Kira. If he didn't belong to a species that served as the main antagonist of the series, he wouldn't have had anything interesting going for him. Many people seemed to like Kira's progression. She started as a hotheaded rebel and eventually mellowed out into a (somewhat) diplomatic official by the end of the series. The arc is certainly there, but it's soooo cliche. I've seen the Kira types in dozens of TV shows and movies. Dax was super confusing to me. She was a shy mute in the first few seasons (""cold fish"", as she was described in the Rumpelstiltskin episode), and she suddenly became a charming jokester out of nowhere by the time Worf arrived on the station. Also, it seemed there were more episodes that focused on Curzon than actually revolved around Jadzia. I like Curzon, but I'd rather learn more about Jadzia than the crusty old man. Some of the initial O'Brien episodes were strong, but I got tired of the O'Brien must suffer at least one episode every season trope. Outside of his burgeoning friendship with Julian, does he really develop as a character? And what the hell happened to Dukat? A cunning, resourceful dictator who loses his mind and becomes the anti-christ-  are you kidding me?

It's insane.",1597886138,"It's otherwise a reasonably interesting episode, but there desperately needed to be another two or three minutes near the end to better flesh out the immediate consequences of Worf's discovery that his friend, K'mtar, is actually his time-traveling son. 

The weirdness of how he even got there is completely glossed over (""forty years from now the ways are well known. But few are willing to risk the dangers""), and the episode ends literally a minute after he and Worf share an emotional embrace as Worf tells him... he *won't* be doing what the guy traveled back in time to beg him to do, and that he should just return to the future in which the House of Mogh has been decimated and K'mtar himself has become a laughingstock and keep plugging away at it, it will probably be fine.

There is no resolution to this *at all*. We get no more clarity on how K'mtar feels about this or what he actually decides to do. It's not even clear if K'mtar has any way of leaving the ship, so he either has to go awkwardly stay in his quarters for days until they can drop him off somewhere, or he has a time traveling device that's small enough to carry around concealed with him everywhere. That being activated on the Enterprise would presumably trigger some kind of sensor, and Worf would have to offer explanations about harboring a secret time traveler for days or weeks that are not even hinted at.

There's a brief coda of Worf telling Alexander on the holodeck that their training can wait, and that K'mtar had to go away forever, but that's it. An actual smash-cut to the credits mid-sentence wouldn't have been less jarring, and would at least have been entertaining enough to be justified.

82,I'm digging Star Trek: Enterprise much more than I thought I would.,1597885304,"Back in the day when Scott Bakula was cast in the lead role of Enterprise i decided to take a hard pass on it. I can't explain it but there's just always been something about him I never cared for.

Fast forward to a few weeks ago when I noticed its streaming on Netflix so I decided to give it a shot.
I've been really enjoying it and am now on S02E23. 

The stories so far have been far better than I expected and the NX-01 is a great looking ship.

I can't say the majority of the casting is anything special and I wish someone had told Jolene Blalock that a Vulcan may be suppressing their emotions but it doesn't mean T'Pol has to speak in a monotone voice.
Still, I think she was cast well but just needed some better direction developing the character.

86,Loving DS9 doesn't mean you have to hate VOY - 2020 Rewatch (spoilers),1597881438,"I rewatch DS9 at least 2 times a year. In. COVID times I think I'm on #3 of just this year. Finally challenged myself to rewatch Voyager for the first time since Middle School. 

As of S1E11, here are some points that stand out to me:

- Mulgrew acts the s**t out of her role, even better than I remember. The scene in her ready room after Torres and Tuvok steal the trajector / space folding tech is Avery Brooks level. I felt like *I* was the one in trouble. She was under-appreciated then and still is. You can literally see the dispair/agony of being a science officer flung in to a seemingly hopeless/doomed leadership role from the get-go and she just sells the crap out of it.

- The Seska/Cardassian/Kazon plot is introduced way earlier than I remember it. This was so gripping when I first watched and now I understand why. Anyone who stands by the argument that VOY was the unserialized yang to DS9's Ying is mistaken. It's just less serialized.

- Horrible character aside, Robert Beltran really sucked. I want to give him all the benefit of the doubt given ST's/Roddenberry's less-than-questionable relationship with native American culture, but he just isn't compelling. He also struggled with the techno-babble well past the first season. Besides, Janeway defaults to Tuvok for advice when needed and only seems to go to Chakotay when something involves a Maquis character. I think he was stuck in an endless cycle of under acting, having his role reduced, being totally unsupported by the writers, under acting in response, then rinse/repeat etc.

- Robert Picardo is a goddamned national icon and held a lot of S1 together. I'm glad they smoothed his character out around ep 9/10 or so. No facial hair to mark the transition here...

- Neelix isn't anywhere near as frequently featured or annoying as most people make him out to be (I changed my opinion to this view during this rewatch).

- Both crews (Maquis and Starfleet) integrated/reintegrated waaaaay too smoothly and quickly to overcome suspension of disbelief. The Maquis were the dirtiest of all humanoids in DS9 (Federation Traitors!) and this seemed to be glanced over too quickly. I wish we had a better idea of the time span of the transition past the ""several weeks"" mentioned in one of Janewway's Captains Log monologues.

- Jennifer Lien deserved a better character than Kes. End of point.

Looking forward to the Year of Hell.
