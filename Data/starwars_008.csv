They meet back up with Cody and they go on a couple missions with him and then they find intel on captain rex. Then for one episode it‚Äôs all about Rex, and him finding Wolffe and Gregor, then the next episode or 2 it‚Äôs back to the bad batch and Cody instructs then to hunt down rex who is now a traitor. And then they find Rex with Wolffe and Gregor. Rex then explains what‚Äôs happened and removes echo and the rest of their chips and then the last episode or 2 the empire (including Cody) realise that the bad batch has joined the traitors and then have a big battle wit them, all of the bad batch die to save rex, Wolfe and Gregor.",StarWars,Unsilenced_Chaos_,False,/r/StarWars/comments/htk1tm/how_i_want_bad_batch_to_go_at_least_see_these/

32,Favorite Head Cannon that makes the Sequel Trilogy Better,1595090672,"I'll start, the Holdo Maneuver only worked because of DJ.  He opened up a section of the shield on the Supremecy on purpose to aid Holdo when he escaped after betraying Fin and Rose.  I like this because it redeems DJ a little, we already saw that he can do this, it gives him some purpose, and no one would still understand why the Holdo Maneuver worked.

The second of my favorite head canons is that Light Speed Tracking only works because the First Order can track all stormtroopers (because of an internal chip similar to the order 66 inhibitor chips)  Fin would be the reason why the First Order could follow them and when Fin left and went to Canto Bight everyone would have been safe to getaway!  It makes Canto Bight a little better and it's sort of twisted because for half the movie everyone could have escaped.

In my head, both of these are true when I watch The Last Jedi and it makes the movie better for me.  What other great head cannon is out there for the sequel trilogy?",StarWars,emjay4189,False,/r/StarWars/comments/htjowe/favorite_head_cannon_that_makes_the_sequel/

72,The Last Jedi didn't end the trilogy. Stop saying that.,1595018637,"One extremely persistent complaint about Last Jedi is that it ended the trilogy prematurely and that  Rise of Skywalker was *doomed* because of the creative choices in that movie. If you've been on this sub and read any comments sections at all, you've read the argument I'm describing that Rian Johnson somehow preemptively sabotaged Episode 9 by wrapping up everything that it could have been about.

This is close-minded and wrong.

Yes, Snoke was killed. Yes, killing Snoke was seen as the natural endpoint of the trilogy. However, the most interesting stories come once characters no longer have tasks provided to them, but are free to make choices. If there is a 'big bad' that they need to fight, then they fight it or him. 

Kylo Ren's story is not over because Snoke is dead. I would argue that his story only really *begins* once Snoke is dead, because he's a man now free to make his own choices and watch the consequences unfold. Rey no longer *must* kill anyone because Kylo Ren is objectively worse at this stuff than her, so she suddenly has a choice to make.

If you guys really wanted another movie about Rey waiting for parents to show up or Kylo Ren listening to Snoke, I guess that's fine, but I, for one, think the Force Awakens is boring because that's all those characters do - wait for someone else to show up or call a shot. I'd like a movie where they have to make choices and live with them.

Episode 9 could have been a whole movie about Kylo Ren's struggles to govern a First Order that maybe doesn't respect him and the Resistance gaining political footholds just because he looks so incompetent. Imagine an Episode 9 that ended with him *failing* to be the 'next Vader' that he wants so badly to be despite having the whole First Order at his command. He would have to grapple with being objectively worse. Rey would have to decide if someone who was objectively worse at using the Force than her needed killing the way Palpatine and the Separatists, in their day, did. And, in a movie about people losing faith in the First Order, it seems pretty obvious that Finn would have plenty to do as a leader to rehabilitated Stormtroopers, but he would have to choose once and for all that he believed in democracy and in himself to do it.

The argument that Last Jedi left the franchise nowhere to go is objectively wrong, and the fact that Rise of Skywalker fails to pick up on the plotlines and themes of Last Jedi  does not mean that Last Jedi left nothing to build from.",StarWars,TheT-Rexr,False,/r/StarWars/comments/ht3irz/the_last_jedi_didnt_end_the_trilogy_stop_saying/

Right before COVID hit I became a passholder to WDW and visited galaxy's edge. It was amazing but I didn't understand it at all. I decided i would start watching Star Wars, I watched in chronological order and it took me 4 sessions to finish EP 1, maybe 3 sessions for 2 and 3. I slowly made progress then COVID really kicked in down here in FL and in the last month, I was able to sit through and watch rogue one, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 &amp; 9. I am fully hooked. I finished Mandolorian in 2 days, lego star wars &amp; just finished Battlefront II campaign and now I am starting clone wars. I also was a big lego fan growing up but really only had city stuff, I love tinkering, building, etc so I jumped into buying lego star wars stuff! Here is my collection as of today. I built the shelves and tried to set up a nice little display! Im sad that i missed out of so much amazing stuff from this franchise for so long but im so happy i finally did it. I have reservations for hollywood studios Aug 23 and cant wait to expeiernce galaxy's edge with full knowledge of what im actually looking at.

79,[QUESTION] [Rebels] Why is it seemingly ok for Jedi to mentally manipulate sentient creatures,1595016322,"I am watching Rebels, still in season 1 for any spoilers. Kannan emphasizes that force bonding with other animals is a way to control them. On numerous occasions Kannan and Ezra mentally force manipulate sentient animal creatures like lothcats to attack the empire often to their death. There seems to be no sense that this is super immoral. However, that the Empire installed cybernetic chips in Greebo to control him is seen as a horrible thing to do to him.

Why? Do the Jedi deem it ok to do this to animals but not people? What is the justification for that if the Force does not make this discrimination?",StarWars,RumIsTheMindKiller,False,/r/StarWars/comments/ht2tp1/question_rebels_why_is_it_seemingly_ok_for_jedi/

7,"Confused about People's Interpretation of ""Broom Boy"" in Last Jedi",1595011150,"First off, I realize Last Jedi is still divisive. This isn't meant to spark a debate about the film's quality as a whole. I'm just focused on one scene. The kid with the broom at the end who uses the Force.

I keep coming across articles or people in conversation talking about how the ending of the Last Jedi ""changed""  Star Wars lore so that a person didn't have to come from a powerful Force-wielding family like the Skywalkers to be Force-sensitive. 

[https://www.themarysue.com/democratization-of-the-force-in-star-wars/](https://www.themarysue.com/democratization-of-the-force-in-star-wars/)

""Even more important is the fact that **these average people can be Force-sensitive**. Right now, Rey is the most powerful example of that, but the movie ending with Temiri Blagg using the Force means that the power is something anyone, perhaps even *everyone*, can have access to.""

This more recent article suggests that it's a concept that has yet to be utilized.

[https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/star-wars-the-saga-still-needs-to-follow-through-on-the-end-of-the-last-jedi.html/](https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/star-wars-the-saga-still-needs-to-follow-through-on-the-end-of-the-last-jedi.html/)

""So much of *Star Wars* has revolved around legacy, midi-chlorian counts, and the like. *The Last Jedi* attempts to **create a universe in which a person from nowhere could become a powerful force** for good or evil.""

I understand that to a certain degree, people are talking about the shift from the film saga centering on legacy and lineage to the idea that THE central, extraordinary person can come from anywhere. The Last Jedi's idea of Rey's parents being nobodies serves this. 

However, I'm baffled by people seeing this as a change in the way the Force works. They speak as if Rey and the Broom Boy not being related to any known Jedi is inherently a change to the mythos. Do people just...not get Star Wars? I don't understand how this can be someone's understanding of what determines a person's Force-sensitivity unless the only Star Wars material they've seen is the original trilogy. 

While the Jedi code of no attachment might not be explicitly stated in Phantom Menace, it's a central focus within Attack of the Clones. So if Jedi aren't getting married and probably aren't running around getting people pregnant, clearly Force-sensitivity is a pretty randomly occurring trait. It's quite clear that the Skywalkers are the exception, not the rule.

The vast majority of Jedi, including central heroes like Obi-wan, Qui-gon, Mace, Ahsoka, Kanan, Ezra, Cal Kestis, etc all come from essentially nowhere significant. Aside from Yoda (whose race is mysterious and seemingly central to The Mandalorian) and now Rey, there has not traditionally been any emphasis on the family lines of the non-Skywalker Jedi. Yet for some reason, there is this very pervasive idea that the Broom Boy represented a paradigm shift that the series has yet to explore.

 Those images of Kylo Ren's version of a Star Destroyer got me thinking about him as a character.¬† It is already established lore that Jedi often work on something to keep themselves grounded in reality. Be it piloting ships, working with droids, or speaking with other people. I think it would have been an interesting change of pace if Kylo kept himself grounded by designing ships. What if he designed the absolute fleet killers of the First Order? It would help flesh out his nostalgia for the Empire and it would be a change of pace to ""evil guy in a mask."" I can imagine him being skilled in the Force but also intelligent when it comes to designing a fleet. It makes sense, his father was one of the best and creative pilots, his mother was the general of the Rebellion, and his mentor knew how to take down large targets. Kylo Ren could have been the perfect choice for designing a ship to counter the New Republic/Resistance.¬†

and from a lore standpoint, I believe that (since the planet wasn't blown up) Kylo would have spent more time on Corellia as a Kid before joining Lukes' Jedi Praxeum, meaning that Ben (had he became a Jedi) would have gotten some experience with the Corellian Engineering Corporation and have easily been susceptible to the playful rumor that Kylo ""had Jet-Fuel for blood"" (A common joke made about Corellians due to their apparent love for being both the best pilots and the best shipwrights in the Galaxy). Having grown up most of his early life on Corellia, Kylo would have quickly jumped at the opportunity to design and fly his own capital ships when he became part of the First Order, often showing up Hux whenever he tried to assume command of one of the ships that Kylo had personally designed and that only he knew the ships layout and design faculties. Or if Kylo hears that Hux ended up using one of his designed ships in a way that caused unnecessary damage or preventable loss-of-life had Hux used the systems that Kylo had installed within the ship in the first place, only for Hux to keep getting fed up at Kylo trying to assume command over his fleet like this. It would have provided a more believable and realistic rivalry between the two of them that would feel more organic and grounded instead of being contrived and out-of-place like it was in the trilogy.

4,"Don't know if this has been done before, but I had a thought on how to improve TFA and TLJ",1594989501,"What if Rey is actually a dark side user, and kylo is using the light side of the force?

For starters, this is the only explanation for Rey's ability to use the force without training within the original canon. Dark side users don't get power from training, discipline and control, they get it from emotions and from wild abandon. This is more what we get from Rey. Even the way she fights is with big wide baseball swings instead of fine controlled movements. She doesn't use years of practice and tight control, she just sees someone attacking her friends and emotions take over and she rushes to help. She sees her friends buried under rocks and just... Wants to help. It's possible, reasonable even, that she is using a form of the dark side. It's not like the dark side can't use positive emotions as well as just anger and hate. Anakin's entire turn to the dark side is driven, not by hate, but by his love for Padme.

And, you know, a lot of shady Jedi dealings and a bucketload of manipulation from Sheev, but mostly his love for Padme.

Meanwhile, Kylo is prone to temper tantrums, but he was trained in the light side of the force, and he isn't taught using emotion, he is taught using strict training and discipline, even by Snoke. Judging from Snokes actions, he clearly isn't telling Kylo to kill people in order to enhance Kylo's dark side usage the way that Sheev does with Luke. Rather he is directly using Kylo to just bump off enemies. Kylo is using the light side of the force, yes he's angry but his anger doesn't fuel his power, killing his father does *nothing* for his dark side abilities.

This more sense, since these characters' actions and traits (relating to their force powers) are actually much more aligned this way. Kylo, at least in how he uses the force, treats the force the way a light side user would, while Rey acts more like an exceptionally powerful dark side user, using her emotions to achieve incredible things. It also makes more sense for Luke to be scared of her in TLJ, since in his experience emotion fueled power is evil - it's how Sheev tried to turn him to the dark side, it's how Anakin was turned. It makes more sense for him to be afraid of her power if she is getting it from the dark side. Hell, basically the only thing they do to suggest they're from one side or another is what colour lightsaber they use!

As an added bonus, this idea brings a whole new dimension of actually interesting moral grey area to the story, with the idea (which was already implied in the prequels!) that light side users definitely can be evil or do terrible things, as Kylo does, and the idea that the dark side can be morally defensible is brought up in RotS. You could argue that the dark side not being intrinsically evil is a major philosophical theme in RotS.

This doesn't fix all the plot holes in the sequels or the bad chorography, and it's totally incompatible with Rise of Skywalker, which at this point should be totally written off as a stinking dumpster fire with no artistic merit... But I think this does greatly improve the dynamics of the first two sequels. They definitely had enough potential to redeem themselves, and with this aspect they would finally have a unique moral conflict, as opposed to just shamelessly copying the OT.",StarWars,Passance,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hsuxvo/dont_know_if_this_has_been_done_before_but_i_had/

38,The Palpatine family is the most powerful Force sensitive lineage,1594976832,"Warning! Spoilers for The Rise of Skywalker

Hello there,

After watching the entire Skywalker Saga, it seems to me that the Palpatine family bloodline is the most powerful and also influential Force-sensitive lineage in the galaxy.

Here are some reasons why I think this is the case (Canon):

1. This one is obvious. In canon, Palpatine is easily one of the most powerful and influential Sith Lords of all time. As a Force user, his powers are nearly unparalleled, showing he has this innate ability. 

2. New Canon establishes Rey as sort of a Choosen One destined to bring balance to the Force. She is confirmed to be Palpatine‚Äôs granddaughter. 

3.  This point is hypothetical and is based on speculation. 

Assuming that Palpatine is actually Anakin‚Äôs biological father (seeing how Palpatine was able to father a son in Canon), the Chosen One is actually descended from the Palpatine lineage. 

What are your thoughts on this theory? Does it seem reasonable that the Palpatine family is actually more powerful than the Skywalker lineage?",StarWars,LeGrandAmiral,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hssgi8/the_palpatine_family_is_the_most_powerful_force/

50,Why the heck was Obi Wan sent to Utapau to kill Grievous?,1594970762,"Now I know that in the Revenge of the Sith novelization, there's a scene where Mace gives him the assignment and says that since he's THE master of Soresu, he's the absolute best choice to face Grievous. This makes sense in the context of the movies and novelization, but the logic falls apart as soon as you take either clone wars series into account.
First off, the CGI Clone Wars. I was watching ""Grievous Intrigue"" from season two and I was surprised to see that Obi Wan and Grievous fought before Revenge of the Sith. Now Obi Wan holds his own against Grievous and his guards but he doesn't really overpower him or show himself to be Grievous's ""perfect match."" Not only is the fight pretty balanced, but Grievous only uses two arms for most of it and easily manages to escape. This is Grievous's main strategy in a fight, either overwhelm his opponent or run away, and he does it pretty well. He's done it to Obi Wan in the past, even though he was on Obi Wan's ship which was full of his troopers. So why did they think Obi Wan would be able to stop him from escaping like always, especially when he hadn't in the past?
The biggest take away from rewatching the Grievous episodes is that Obi Wan isn't the best pick to fight Grievous. He stands his ground which is impressive but he's not amazing against him. You know who is? Kit Fitso. He utterly humiliates Grievous. He's never even scared and is smiling the whole time when he duels him. Soresu is defensive and precise which is good for opposing Grievous but Fitso's form 1 Shii Chi style is much better because it was literally meant to fight multiple opponents ei, multiple lightsabers. Sure, he didn't kill Grievous that day but he disarmed him and had him on the ropes. That counts for something.
The hand drawn Clone Wars series brings up another issue. Now, this is no longer canon but at the time Revenge if the Sith was released, it was and it even acted as a prelude to the movie. In it Grievous faces off against six Jedi, including two masters. He duels Mundi and Shak Ti at the same time and Mundi is at least close to the skill level of Obi Wan. So my question becomes: why did they send Obi Wan alone?
There's no advantage to him fighting alone, especially since he didn't use the element of surprise. Grievous is literally the only Sepratist leader left and he's the most wanted man in the galaxy,. The Jedi council thinks he's a monster and wants him destroyed. Why wouldn't they send more Jedi? I know their forces were stretched thin and Anakin couldn't go but they had people to spare. Kit Fitso, who'd more than held him own against Grievous in the past, was at the Jedi temple, along with the two other masters Mace took to arrest Palpatine (Who were great warriors, just not near Palpatines level.) Heck, Schr√∂dinger's Jedi, Shak Ti, was maybe kinda probably alive and in the Jedi temple at that time and had faced Grievous three times. So why not bring multiple Jedi, especially when Grievous always cheated and used his electro staff guards? I know that the Star Wars movies and series mess with each other in weird ways (Anakin not being able to meet Grievous in The Clone Wars, ""My powers have doubled since we last meet."" When they double, in the span of like two weeks?) But it just seems weird to me. Of course, it worked and Obi Wan is awesome but if anyone has a response to this, I'd love to hear it.",StarWars,Both_Tone,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hsre0b/why_the_heck_was_obi_wan_sent_to_utapau_to_kill/

It could also allow writers the freedom to explore alternate endings to several events in the mythos, such as Order 66 or The Battle of Endor.

93,Thoughts on Force-Healing,1594958685,"A common argument on the internet since the release of *Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker* has been against the use of Force-healing in the film. Critics and fans alike have complained about the ability, calling it a plot hole in the overall narrative of the franchise, citing the ability as a last-minute addition that detracts from key moments in the Original trilogy and undermines the entire plot of the Prequel trilogy. While I agree that the use of the ability in the film could have been executed more neatly, I personally don't believe that Force-healing feels out-of-place in the story or the *Star Wars* universe as a whole.

In *The Rise of Skywalker*, Force-healing is shown to have several key characteristics. Firstly, Force-healing is shown as a transfer of life-force between the user and the target. Secondly, Force-healing is shown to be at least somewhat physically draining for the giver of the energy. Thirdly, all instances of Force-healing are shown to be committed by characters the narrative has explicitly established as being strong in the Force. Finally, Force-healing is not all-powerful, the ability is established throughout *The Rise of Skywalker* as having limitations and, in some cases, lasting consequences for those involved.

A common question raised since the release of *The Rise of Skywalker* is why we haven't seen this ability used throughout the saga. Why was Obi-Wan not able to heal Qui-Gon in *The Phantom Menace*? Why couldn't Anakin heal Padm√© in *Revenge of the Sith*? Why, in *Return of the Jedi*, did Luke watch Vader die aboard the Death Star II rather than heal him? One reason the ability may not have been used beforehand is because it applies to neither Jedi nor Sith teachings as depicted in the first six films. The Jedi, seeing death as ""a natural part of life,"" would have no use in an ability that could be interpreted as interceding with the will if the Force. Perhaps Obi-Wan saw Qui-Gon's death at the hands of Darth Maul in *The Phantom Menace* as fate or destiny, and therefore not his place to interfere. Palpatine, obsessed with his own plans and power, would similarly have no need to be giving his Force energies to others and certainly would have no purpose in helping his new apprentice save Padm√©, who would only serve as a temptation away from the Dark side of the Force for Vader.

Perhaps Force-healing was a known ability in the earlier *Star Wars* films, but inaccessible due to the amount of power in the Force required. The Sequel Trilogy goes out of its way to establish Rey, Kylo Ren, and Palpatine as the most powerful Force- users in the galaxy up to that point. In *The Last Jedi* Luke Skywalker, who had spent his life among the likes of Kenobi, Vader, and Yoda, had said about Rey: ""I've seen this raw strength only once before: in Ben Solo."" It is therefore safe to assume that the grandson of Vader and the granddaughter of Palpatine were beyond anything Luke had seen in his journey as a Jedi. Palpatine, meanwhile, had proven his own power in the Force by raising thousands of Star Destroyers from under the surface of Exegol before he forcibly took Force energy from Rey and Ben. It is therefore not beyond the realm of possibility that the ability of Force-healing is unique in the narrative to Rey, Ben, and Palpatine.

 Another possibility is that Force-healing as a skill was lost to the Jedi of the original films only to be recovered by Luke Skywalker's search for lost Jedi knowledge after the Original Trilogy. It would therefore stand to reason that he would teach the skill to Leia and Ben, with his sister later passing the information on to her apprentice: Rey.

So while the obvious out-of-universe reason of the ability being introduced in *The Rise of Skywalker* may be unsatisfactory to viewers of the film, I hope I've made at least somewhat of a case for the in-universe reasoning for the lack of Force-healing in the other films.

97,Cool idea for answer to Luke/Anakin‚Äôs (Rey‚Äôs) lightsaber reappearing in the Disney sequels using ‚ÄúThe Mandalorian‚Äù,1594956139,"Ok so let me start by saying it was infuriating having Anakin‚Äôs and Luke‚Äôs lightsaber show up in ‚ÄúThe Force Awakens‚Äù with so much intrigue only to have no answer ever given (a good question for another time BS). Ahsoka Tano we know is confirmed to be in ‚ÄúThe Mandalorian‚Äù season 2. How awesome would it be to Ahsoka pick up her old master‚Äôs saber and wield it in his honor (maybe after losing her own and Kyber is hard to come by now)?! You could even have Snips making a connection with Maz to cause her to be aware of its existence. This would be the kind of cool continuity between the sequels and the show that would not feel forced. Mainly, I just think the idea of Ahsoka wielding Anakin‚Äôs saber in the future is just perfect.

10,What is the difference between Terminator 2 and 1 and all of the original trilogy and the sequel trilogy?,1594954015,"I have an idea of why one sequel is seen as better by the respective movies audience. From my observations on youtube videos I found that one of the main reasons why the sequel trilogy isn't liked is because the sequel trilogy takes away the victories the characters accomplished in the original trilogy by  regressing Hans character arc, there being a new threat and bringing back Palpatine. 
What I mean by victories taken Away is between the two movies, the ""normal world"" of Terminator 2 doesn't take away the  victories that the main characters acheived in the first movie. Such as not having Sarah Conner dead, the first Terminator although may have seemed like a victory taken away from the first movie at first, it is revealed that this is a different terminator of the same model. 
What Force Awakens immediantly did in the normal world was have the victory of the galactic threat being gone being taken away and having the normal world under attack by a new threat, the first order.
I feel if the normal world of the force awakens expanded on the victories of the previous story such as the new republic thriving, Luke being a master Jedi and the leader of a council and then introduced the new threat soon after, it would make the audience more accepting of the force awakens.

Day 2: The ISS is either destroyed or Boarded by Stormtroopers who would be surprised at the lack of gravitational technology.

Day 3-6: With the Empire showing no signs of letting up, an emergency UN meeting would be called. The Star destroyer sends a legion of stormtroopers and a fleet of tie fighters to occupy the Planet. First thing they would be met with would be missiles and heavy AA fire from the ground. Tie fighters would stand no chance as they lack countermeasures. The ground troops would struggle to land as the AA systems would shoot the transports down. The ones that do reach the ground would be overwhelmed by the military. Stormtrooper armour is weak to bullets so would be penetrated easily. Any AT ATs that landed would be blasted by Tanks. The first few days would be a win for earth.

Day 7: The Star destroyer begins aerial bombardment of the planet. This would cost lives and make it alot harder for us.

Day 8: Several Nuclear warheads are launched at the star destroyer and its other ships.

People often call Ashoka, qui gon and Revan ‚ÄúGrey Jedi‚Äù. Both qui gon and Ashoka were detached from the Jedi order but never achieved balance with the force, they were just what true Jedi were meant to be. Revan fell to the dark side after the mandalorian wars, he found out about the true sith in the unknown regions and used the dark side to unite the republic in this goal, It‚Äôs even said he sacrificed himself for his ‚Äúfall to the dark side‚Äù. The closest thing you can ever get to being in the grey area is Kreia, and that‚Äôs because she hated both the light and the dark.

I think this goes for anyone the fans label as balancing both light and dark perfectly. It just doesn‚Äôt work because what eventually happens is that you lean more to the dark side because it‚Äôs a vacuum cleaner that wants to make you do bad things.

54,"I think the Star Wars sequels aren‚Äôt as bad as everyone says they are, and will be appreciated more as time passes.",1594940975,"I‚Äôve seen all 3 of the sequels multiple times, and I have to say I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre as bad as everyone says they are. But before I start talking about why, I‚Äôd just like to get this out of the way: THE SEQUELS ARE NOT PERFECT, AND HAVE A LOT OF PROBLEMS. 

The sequels introduced a lot of new and interesting ideas, but the three movies were not executed well. 

The Force Awakens: Finn‚Äôs character is a great example of execution gone wrong. The idea of a stormtrooper who escaped from the First Order is a great one, but unfortunately outside of The Force Awakens, this concept is mostly ignored. Aside from this, I actually think TFA is a strong movie that is a pretty good watch. The writing feels a little too jokey/Disney-fied, but overall it‚Äôs pretty good. Also, I liked what they did with Kylo Ren and Han in this.

The Last Jedi: This movie is probably the most controversial of the three. I have to admit, when I first saw this movie in theaters I absolutely HATED it. I thought everything about the movie was wrong. I felt like much of the movie was wasted on the rebel‚Äôs ship,  on Canto Bight, and I thought that the Battle of Crait was a boring mirror of Hoth. I also didn‚Äôt feel like Luke‚Äôs death was fitting at all. What I liked about the movie when I first saw it was Kylo Ren thinking twice about firing on Leia, and the throne room fight. 

AFTER REWATCHING the movie, it felt much stronger to me. I thought Poe and Finn had nice character development, and while I still felt like much of the movie was a little boring, I ended up liking what they did with Luke. Haunted by what he felt like he spurred in Kyko Ren, he exiled himself, and when he realized his mistake, all he could do was buy the resistance some time and face his nephew one last time. I thought Luke‚Äôs force projection was meaningful, as he went out like a true Jedi, facing his enemy head on, but in the smartest way possible where no one gets hurt. That was all he could do. Like he said, he couldn‚Äôt face down the entire First Order himself. I also really liked how conflicted Kylo Ren is during the entire movie. It really makes him more human, relatable, and interesting. The entire throne room fight was great, and Kylo‚Äôs betrayal of Snoke was great too. This movie was not perfect but it wasn‚Äôt bad either.

Rise Of Skywalker: This is the movie that I‚Äôm actually most conflicted about. The movie starts off strong. Kylo Ren slaughtering people and is clearly dead set on finding the Emperor, and will stop at nothing. The only problem is... he finds him so quickly. This is what I feel is the movies biggest problem. It is TOO FAST. The first half of the movie moves much too quickly, and feels odd due to the cuts and the speed at which everything is happening. I would have loved to see a parallel of Kylo Ren and Rey‚Äôs search for the Emperor, as there were two pathfinders. Kylo Ren slaughtering in a relentless search for him, paired with Rey solving an archaeological Sith mystery with her friends. Instead, we see much of the movie is Kylo Ren trying to find Rey, instead of the pathfinder which he found literally five minutes into the movie. I do have to admit, though, the part about that I do like is it sets up Kylo Ren and Rey‚Äôs relationship, and it makes sure you know Kylo Ren isn‚Äôt taking orders from the Emperor, just buying time to get Rey on his side to betray Palpatine. Other than this, the first half of the movie is way too fast, and, of course, the ‚ÄúTHEY FLY NOW!‚Äù line is probably the worst in the entire saga. I also think the search for Ochi‚Äôs ship on Pasaana was very weak and boring. Also, Rey force healing that serpent was ridiculous, not because she could force heal, but because that was an unrealistic risk to take, and felt like it had no place in the movie. 
The second half of the movie, on the other hand, I actually really liked. This part of the movie felt much more devoid of stupid jokes, and, focuses more on Kylo Ren and Rey. I feel like when the battle on the ruins of the Death Star II starts, the movie picks up so much. During that battle, I feel like you really feel how strong Kylo Ren is, as he pretty much overwhelms Rey and only gets stabbed because of Leia‚Äôs intervention, which felt like the best they could do to give Kylo Ren a reunion with her due to Carrie‚Äôs death. I REALLY enjoyed Kylo‚Äôs moral struggle being personified in the form of him talking to his father. Kylo feeling like he‚Äôs too far gone now that his mother is gone was great, and this scene really was emotional. This scene is also the only time in all nine movies when the word ‚Äúdad‚Äù is spoken. After realizing what he wants to spend the rest of his life fighting for, Kylo hurls his lightsaber into the ocean, completing his transformation back into Ben. Rey‚Äôs reunion with Luke was good too, as he acknowledges that he was wrong by going into exile, and assures her that it‚Äôs not the right thing to do.  The climax of the movie on Exegol was so-so, as after we see these great scenes of Ben defeating his knights and showing his true self, he gets thrown down a shaft for the entire fight with Palpatine. I also hated how Palpatine gets injured/defeated with his own lightning AGAIN, and there was no actual battle besides Rey blocking some lightning. It would have been much better if there was an actual choreographed battle with Ben at her side, along with many of the former Jedi‚Äôs force ghosts lending strength. But, of course, Rey defeats him alone and Ben sacrifices his life for hers, feeling happy for the first time in his adult life. I liked the bittersweet ending for Ben, but honestly, it would have been better if Rey died and he had to figure out how to live and atone for his past actions. And Rey ‚ÄúSkywalker‚Äù was predictable, but not as bad as people make it out to be. 

Rise Of Skywalker is a mess, but it‚Äôs a giant mess with a few diamonds in it, as the movie has its moments. Kylo Ren and Rey (but mostly Kylo Ren) were the stars of this movie, and it sucks that Finn and Poe were shafted, not to mention General Hux‚Äôs poor excuse of a part, and not explaining how Palpatine came back was awful.

Overall, the movies are DEFINITELY not perfect, but I don‚Äôt think they deserve all the hate they get, especially after rewatching them. There are so many things that could be better, but that also goes for the Prequels (which I also love). People have to keep in mind that the Prequels were vehemently hated for a long time, and only recently have people begun to come around to them, and I really think the same will happen to the Sequels. Kylo Ren is actually my (and many other people‚Äôs) favorite Star Wars character, and I know Rey is a character that many young kids (and adults!) love. I would not be surprised when people start showing appreciation for these movies, even though it might take some time.",StarWars,GrayGoliath,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hskjq9/i_think_the_star_wars_sequels_arent_as_bad_as/

I know this issue has probably been addressed before, but my knowledge of Star Wars universe stops with the movies, cartoons, and games, I know nothing about writers and producers, and I was wondering if it's possible they completely shifted the plot from the original plan.

If that's the case, my personal opinion is that Rey coming from nowhere and nobody was a way better idea than Rey Palpatine. But, again, I think this is a popular opinion.

32,The kiss at Resistance base in TROS feels like JJ Abrams' Star Wars in a nutshell. Trying to be important and relevant with no substance behind it.,1594921347,"I'm not sure how others feel about it, but the kiss between the Resistance Doctor and the other lady at the end of TROS felt so tacked on and obviously a ""Hey look, equality!"" thing, except that it lacked what would have actually made people feel included which would have been making it a normal part of the story. 

Not saying that Finn and Poe should have been gay or whatever. But it just feels like that's JJ's thing in general with his Star Wars movies. ""Hey look, I clearly care about this thing and it's important!"" on a meta level, while any story reasoning and buildup is in-existent. 

The dude wrote so much stuff in TFA and (especially) TROS that is could almost be 4th wall breaking if the character just looked at the camera. 

Billy Dee Williams shows up on a random desert planet for no reason aside from, hey remember Lando?! He's totally stayed here for years just waiting for you guys to stop on by!

TFA where Finn is literally just pulling out old Star Wars props in a quick succession. 

Hey look, it's Palpatine! And uhhh Snoke was his creation too! Totally planned that! (btw at this point, anyone who tries to claim JJ had any plans whatsoever in TFA can shhh). 

Anyway, back to the point I was trying to get to. I used to defend the sequels a ton because I really love Kylo as a character, and Rey I enjoy while she could have been better written... but it's really hard to defend the movies themselves (primarily TFA and TROS imo) because they're so blatantly soulless. TLJ at least had some soul and care put into it, even if you disagree with the story it chose. 

TFA is just copy pasted ANH, when they could have literally done ANYTHING. Completely blank slate. Fucked the ST from the start by doing that, causing whatever 8 was gonna be to need to follow in some extent (rebel vs empire dynamic, young force kid goes to seek jedi master on remote island, emperor figure to vader figure, etc). 

 and TROS completely ignored every original idea that TLJ introduced that might have made 9 interesting and vomited all kinds of shots and scenes that COULD have been meaningful, if they ever had any time, build up, or care put into them. Part of JJ agreeing to do 9 was that he could literally straight up ignore the story group at LFL lol... which is why Poe's backstory was fucked, and clearly a ton of LFL people hated TROS with a passion if you look at their twitters. 

**TL;DR: JJ Abrams is a hack and ruined the ST more than any other individual (except maybe Kennedy for hiring him twice). He shoves short moments into the movies that he thinks are meaningful and relevant (like the same-sex kiss), but refuses to actually normalize or create meaningful moments by making them a more inclusive and important part of the story.**",StarWars,kidwifi,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hsean7/the_kiss_at_resistance_base_in_tros_feels_like_jj/

53,Fixing Midichlorians,1594914672,"I know some people really hate the Midichlorians from the prequels. But I had a thought, what if the term just came from Mitochondria? Meaning, that the force resides everywhere still, but can just be noticed and measured in Mitochondria only? Give me a chance, please keep reading.


To make it fun, remember that Mitochondria were and some still are free living prokaryotes. At some point in our planet's evolution, single-celled organisms started ""working together"" as an ""individual"" unit. This is called the Theory of Endosymbiosis. Who is to say that these organisms responsible for almost all energy production on our planet are not influenced by the Force?


Also remember that black matter/energy exists. These essentially have impacts on gravity that we cannot physically observe. But it literally exists everywhere. Including Mitochondria. Sounds like the Force to me.


So maybe, in a galaxy far, far, away, is actually when humans have traveled so far enough into space that the effects of gravity and time no longer effects our astronomers. While time passes on Earth, it no longer does for our space heroes. But because of the rate at which light travels, when they look back at Earth, they see a premature planet, not yet what it is now. So when they beam their stories home, they fail to realize that time hasn't moved backwards, but they are actually looking at the past. Failing to understand this, and feeling that they have travelled through time, we are told of a story from a long, long, time ago.

In Rebels, you can hear him utter the line: ""the apprentice lives"" which would indicate that he is somewhat surprised but it seems to me that he assumed it was a possibility in that very last scene of TCW. Obviously the narrative of the latter was written AFTER so they might have changed that on purpose. 

This might share some of my views on the matter: [https://youtu.be/CIvez8JhR-o](https://youtu.be/CIvez8JhR-o) 

You could also interpret that scene in a different manner entirely and that is actually how I choose to look at it. Vader assumes that Ahsoka is dead and in that moment the persona of Anakin is completely lost, before it was maybe at like 90% Vader 10% Anakin and now after losing Padme, Ahsoka and everything he cared about, Anakin is truly gone, and only that 1% of him is left for Luke to reignite.",StarWars,Devizz,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hsaz5u/did_vader_assume_ahsoka_survived_order_66_at/

86,"I hate the scene where Anakin becomes Vader, and here's how I think it should've gone",1594907944,"Even when the prequels were universally hated, RotS still had many people saying it was almost on par with the OT. I however, have always thought it was the worst one of all 6, and I still hate it. The scene where Anakin becomes Vader is a huge reason why. 

In the movie, Ani walks in as Windu has Palpy on the ground, begs him not to kill him cos it's not the Jedi way, chops off his hand, whereupon Palpy uses Thundershock until he blasts off again, then Ani drops to his knees in tears, pledges himself to the Sith (wtf), and in literally the next scene we see him, he *murders defenceless children in cold blood* (mega wtf). 

How I think it should've played out: **Anakin kills Mace Windu**

In the Stover novelisation, we see how Anakin is struggling with the hypocrisy: he *murdered* Dooku, and he rightfully feels terribly guilty about it. But here is a Master of the Order about to do the exact same thing. So it's obviously a very confusing moment for him.   
He pleads with Windu for order and lawful justice, growing more desperate as he sees the only way to save his wife about to be killed (just like in the movie). Windu shouts him down, then tells him ""stand down, Skywalker. This must be done."" Anakin does his Anakin scowl, says ""no"", and it is in that exact moment that Anakin Skywalker dies, and he succumbs to the anger within and falls to the dark side.   
He pulls out his saber and slices off Windu's hand, just as in the movie, but instead of Palpy launching him off into the distance with lighting, Anakin uses the Force to push him over the ledge, killing Mace Windu. 

Palpatine stands up, realising Anakin has turned, gives some spiel about how the Jedi will cast him out for what he has done, and Anakin says ""I'm done with the Jedi."" Palpy gives him another spiel about how if he joins him, he can give him the power to destroy the people who stole him from his mother, enslaved him to their dogma, tried to murder the one person who could help him, etc etc. By now, we've got a full on dark sider on our hands, pacing back and forth in rage, who *willingly submits* to Palpatine's teachings, and looks genuinely enraptured about his new handle of Darth Vader. Palpy gives him the order of going to the Temple to end the future of the Jedi Order (which turns out to be the younglings), and Vader leaves. 

----

In doing it this way, it stops being an act of desperation that somehow turned into the embodiment of evil in a span of 5 minutes, and instead becomes the culmination of all of Anakin's emotional growth. In AotC and the first half of RotS, we see *exactly* where Anakin is heading, but when the climax happens, he starts crying like he broke his mum's vase. Change it so he wanted Palpatine's teachings so he could kill the Jedi he purposely turned away from, and it becomes much better.

In ""the rise of skywalker"" film there is a scene where Rey and the others are dropped into pitfall holes in the desert. Rey, in the caves after, pulls a lightsaber OUT OF NOWHERE to light up the cave. 

Earlier in the film Rey tosses aside the very same lightsaber \[given to her by leia\] and leaves it behind. She does not take it with her, as the film cuts away without her taking it. 

She did not have the blade and yet suddenly we see her holding it later in the desert cave scene. The force dyad thing only works between her and kylo and she cannot just yank random things from random locations. 

How exactly did she just ""magically"" have the lightsaber she very much discarded? 

Also, this reminds me of the scene with han solo in the OG movie where greedo gets killed, then like 5min later you see greedo alive walking in front of the millennium falcon. Like, no joke, in the first movie ever made if you look in front of han solo's ship AFTER greedo is killed, greedo is alive walking in front of hans ship.",StarWars,SPon23567,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hs9zpa/someone_explain_this_plothole/

However, before he was even a Sith Lord, Gunray and the Trade Federation had been communicating with Darth Sidious directly, probably for a while. And even if they didn't have direct communications beforehand, they definitely had conversations during the Clone Wars.

Now, I'd like to think that even if you didn't watch the Original Trilogy first, you probably could recognize that Darth Sidious was just Palpatine under a hood. I'm pretty sure I watched the prequels before Ep 6 when I was a kid.

So do the Separatists ever make the connection between the old British-accented male human under the hood and the old British-accented male human currently serving as the Head of State for their Enemy? It seems unlikely that Gunray, self-serving as he is, would hold this information secret if he felt it could prove useful.

82,Not sure if I should be posting here-- dumb question about LEGO Millennium Falcon for Boyfriend,1594867465,"Hi all! Like the title suggests I'm unsure if I should be posting here, I've been having a tough time with my mental health, I'm a 19 year old female and my boyfriend has been super supportive the past few days and weeks. Additionally, he has put a lot of effort in changing his communication style so that I feel more secure and happier in our relationship. 

I feel really grateful for him and I know he loves Star Wars, I couldn't think of anything to get him (he does BJJ, boxing, loves doughnuts, lifting weights etc.) that I haven't already given him or that simply doesn't have enough value for me to demonstrate how much I appreciate his strength and support. 

I found out there's  LEGO Millennium Falcon that I found in Australia for $1300 approx. 

My question is, because I'm inexperienced with all this and unsure if this is the right gift, whether this is too much as a gift. I'm a university student and I don't work, I do have enough savings to afford this but I look at the price tag and it is steep. If anyone has any experience, is this worth purchasing? Is it really enjoyable? Will it decrease or increase in value in future etc.?

Mostly I just want to give him something so surprising that he has a look of pure joy in his face, I know I can achieve that with buying him some socks and boxers but I want to really I guess dazzle him and I want something special so he understands the depth of my appreciation and gratefulness to him.",StarWars,sharonshi_,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hs1p6z/not_sure_if_i_should_be_posting_here_dumb/

85,I really wish I liked The Last Jedi,1594866791,"I'm wondering if anybody else feels this way. I don't passionately hate The Last Jedi. But I also don't really like it. The best way to describe it is that The Last Jedi severely and viscerally disappoints me. There are some great ideas and moments in the movie, and the other day I was thinking about those moments, and it inspired me to rewatch the movie. I went in open-minded and optimistic; I really wanted this to be the time where I liked it, the time everything came together and made sense to me. And the exact opposite happened. None of it came together or made sense to me, not even the things I like. Those things that I like felt so isolated and disconnected from the rest of the film. I love Luke's arc on its own, but when put into the context of this film, it doesn't have the same impact. By the time Luke showed up on Crait I was just exhausted. The film had completely lost me about 40 minutes ago and I could not muster up the strength to care. I love the scene with Yoda. The theme of failure being the greatest teacher is beautiful. But when put into the context of this film, it's meaning is lost. Every character fails, but only Luke and Poe really learn from their failures. The battle of Crait is cool and visually stunning, but given the way it's awkwardly shoved in at the end of this movie, it ruins the pacing and leaves me wondering why the movie is still going.

I think that my problems with this film are legitimate, but I nevertheless less want to love it. Not liking this movie is actually really sad for me, because I feel like I'm missing out. I've heard people make the most amazing and beautiful arguments for why they love this movie, and all I want is to see what they see. HiTopFilms had a great quote in his Avengers: Endgame video, where he said something like ""The thing about not loving something that everyone loves is that it's fucking miserable."" The Last Jedi makes me feel miserable

I'm posting here because I think it would be awesome if I could make something Star Wars-related. (Before someone suggests it, I did think about making an astromech, but fabrication would take too long and it's also kind of expensive)

Financial constraints say probably no more than $500 in total and I can dedicate a month plus most weekends between August and June of next year. In terms of fabrication machinery, I have a laser cutter, 3d printer, and hand and power tools (drills, saws, etc).

There are some who are wondering of what kinds of stories can and will be eventually told after this saga. Here‚Äôs a rough idea I thought up and wanna see what you guys think. I‚Äôd set it 200-300 hundred years after *TROS*, the galaxy is in a state of peace, the Republic is restored and the Jedi are back to their might. However, a threat from beyond approaches. These are the Grysk. Yeah, those bad guys Thrawn mentioned in his books would eventually come into play in the movies. He mentioned where they could be a threat to the galaxy at large. I‚Äôd have it where they plan to roll across the galaxy and reshape it to their desire. Rather than having yet another story of rebel underdogs and lone Jedi vs big empire, I‚Äôd have the Republic and Jedi at their strength trying to keep the galaxy safe from the Grysk. I‚Äôd have nobody in the Grysk be Force sensitive. Now you‚Äôd be wondering ‚Äúwhere‚Äôs the evil dark sider?‚Äù Well, this is something else in the story. With the Grysk being from the UR, I‚Äôd have some evil cosmic presence influencing and manipulating them from the darkness. I would have this entity be something kinda like Abeloth. It wouldn‚Äôt crave or desire power, but it influences others to create war, misery, and suffering, which then in a way feeds this entity. So we‚Äôd have a story that has a galactic invasion from a highly advanced race while an ancient evil pulls the strings, while our heroes fight to keep the galaxy safe and to prevent everything from being destroyed and reborn in a twisted image.

He slaughtered a village of Innocent men, women, and children, just to get the attention of the Jedi who sent him down this path. He goes back into hiding, and gets his own pirate allies, which are lead by one of the most greediest men in the galaxy, Hondo Onhaka. His legs are now heavily damaged, Savage's arm is cut off, and their ship has crashed, leaving them stranded in Space for most likely DAYS. He is found by Mandalorians, Warriors, who despise the current ruler of Mandalore. He joins the Death Watch, and gets many crime bosses to give them resources, weapons, armies, and credits. He gets revenge on Obi-Wan by KILLING one of his loved ones, in the same fashion he killed his master. Later on, his Brother is killed by his Old Master. He goes into hiding on Mandalore, still ruling from the shadows. The Republic and Some Mandalorians who did not pledge themselves to Maul. He goes back into hiding after Order 66, where he lived on a Sith World, and is found by a Jedi.

77,Small Fixing Episode 9: Make The Mandalorian Rey's Father / Change Her Lineage,1594848324,"# ""This is the Way"". - Din Djarin

A good change that wouldve been awesome is the change to Rey‚Äôs lineage. Her being a Palpatine adds nothing unique, meaningful, or worthwhile that we haven‚Äôt already seen in the story.

*The Mandalorian* aired before Episode 9. I think it wouldve worked to have the whole show air right before 9‚Äôs release. Then in Episode 9 after the world has watched *The Mandalorian* we learn that Rey‚Äôs true parents were ‚Äúnobody‚Äù from a certain POV. She didnt see their faces in the Force but that was because their faces were hidden.

A full flashback / Force vision would show that Din Djarin and an unknown Mandalorian woman are Rey‚Äôs parents. However they fled their people as Rey showed Force abilities and were trying to seek out Luke Skywalker. They knew of him from stories &amp; believed he could train her.

Unfortunately Kylo by this point betrayed Luke and the temple was destroyed. Kylo then hunted down Mando and his wife across the galaxy. In order to protect Rey, Djarin dropped her off on Jakku. The idea being he and Rey‚Äôs mom would go back to a random planet and kill the Knights of Ren and come back for her. Rey‚Äôs mom (whose name &amp; identity is intentionally hidden so it can be explored in future media) says they cant leave Rey alone.

Djarin‚Äôs reaponse? ‚ÄúThis is the way‚Äù.

And it is the way. This is how they can keep Rey out of harm from Kylo Ren &amp; Snoke and face their enemies. They leave Jakku and meet the Knights on a far away planet. The Knights locate them and The Mandalorians fight back. Only to be overwhelmed and both killed.

Djarin is strong of mind and unable to have his mind read by Kylo so that is how Rey went unknown for years.

Rey wouldn‚Äôt quite identify as a Mandalorian after learning the truth. She‚Äôd just have a but more closure over her parents not being legendary heroes or larger than life warriors. True both were Mandalorians but neither was particularly famous or well known. She accept what made them special: ‚Äúthey were my parents‚Äù and that they were just two souls trying to survive in the galaxy is good enough for Rey.

In the final battle, Rey embraces being a Jedi and can hear all the voices of past Jedi. But she also hears a womans voice - her mother. She may have worn Mandalorian Armor but there is more to her than we realize. Rey kills Kylo and avenges her parents and stops Kylo from spreading darkness across the galaxy.

The final shot would see Rey celebrating with her friends and the Resistance. Leia would appear and give Rey her blessing (she doesnt stupidly die) as her apprentice to embrace ‚Äúa new identity‚Äù. Leia kind of officially adopts Rey here and Rey embraces being ‚ÄúRey Skywalker‚Äù. To justify this a bit more, the time skip between 8 &amp; 9 would be significantly larger, like five to six years. Rey and Leia built up a relationship as apprentice and master in that time.

(Aside from that, itd be a nice parallel to her father who wasnt born a Mandalorian but was a ‚ÄúFoundling‚Äù. Like George said, ‚ÄúIts like poetry, it rhymes‚Äù. Rey too wasnt born a Skywalker or born a Jedi but there is no doubt that she is both).

However, while Rey accepts being the new Skywalker, she feels a pull at finding her lineage. Departing on the Millennium Falcon, Rey decides to go out into the galaxy to search for other Mandalorians and maybe even relatives of her parents. Chewy and R2 are with her but then Finn hops aboard.

She tells him ‚Äúitll be a long journey‚Äù or ‚Äúits my journey‚Äù and Finn‚Äôs like ‚ÄúI dont got anywhere else I‚Äôd rather be‚Äù. Kind of a romantic moment but Finn wants to help Rey because he too also has no family he knows of. He wants to help her find hers at least and even if they dont succeed, they have each other. The Falcon flies off into the galaxy.

I wouldn‚Äôt be as dumb as to have a post credits scene. This is the last chapter of the saga. Id want to keep 9 final in that way. But I would revisit both Rey and Finn in a far future finale of *The Mandalorian* show which followed up on where they went and what they found.

Id see Rey &amp; Finn go and find Din Djarin‚Äôs ‚Äúfirst child‚Äù, Baby Yoda, now grown and studying the Force in the far reaches of space or even with his species. In a way he‚Äôs like Rey‚Äôs ‚Äúbrother‚Äù and they bond over that. Rey would also find closure with her father‚Äôs legacy since he wasnt famous but definitely had his fare share of enemies. She'd also learn more about her mother who I imagine as a Force sensitive woman introduced during the events of later seasons of *The Mandalorian.*

85,"With Respect to Sequel lovers, A Critique of Luke Skywalker's The Last Jedi",1594846838,"To those who love the Sequels, I ask you to take a step back and look at the Luke Skywalker that was depicted in Legends. He fought the rogue Jedi clone Joruus C'baoth, the reborn Palpatine of the Dark Empire, and the Yuuzhan Vong invaders. He became the Grandmaster of a New Jedi Order; powerful, wise, virtuous and venerable. He had a beautiful wife, Mara Jade, who he redeemed from the Dark Side and had children with. That was a legitimate and viable progression of his character, not only did it make sense; it felt right. Most Jedi we have seen were flawed; Windu was too dark and aggressive, the Jedi Council was too political and rejecting of emotions, and Obi-Wan was wise but didn't believe Vader could be redeemed, whereas Luke had flaws but overcame them. Compare this to Rey; who's character never even had an arc. She had *zero* apparent flaws, but rather existed as an unstoppable force that barreled through the First Order and Kylo with little effort.

It made no sense, from a storytelling perspective and a character perspective for Luke to become a reclusive hermit like he did in TLJ. Mark Hamill came about so may times disagreeing with this shift in character, I find it very sad to see one of my heroes on screen lamenting at his prized character disintegrating. I haven't had the pleasure to read many of the Expanded Universe novels, but what I have come across depicts an uplifting, believable Luke Skywalker. His character had a full arc, he began as the learner, flawed but hopeful eventually becoming the father of a new generation of Jedi. . 

Juxtapose this to the Luke Skywalker that appeared in TLJ. To quote Mark Hamill, ""I almost had to think of Luke as a different character, maybe he's Jake Skywalker, he's not my Luke Skywalker"". 

If Mark Hamill on video describes that the portrayal of his character was ""not my Luke Skywalker"", something was definitely *wrong*. Now I'm not saying that all actors know their characters better than writers; Harrison Ford wanted to Han to be killed in Return of the Jedi. However, in the case of TLJ where the writers did not coordinate with the writers from The Force Awakens, there was no consistent planned story for the character of Luke, let alone the entire trilogy. As a result, I believe that Mark Hamill had a far better understanding than those that wrote TLJ.

In TLJ, Luke tossed his lightsaber over his shoulder carelessly. So much has been already said about this so I will keep this short. The ending of The Force Awakens saw Luke staring at Rey nearly with tears in his eyes. Abrams clearly had intended something far more consistent with Luke's character then what we saw with Rian's treatment of Luke. Luke immediately tossed it without second thought, it literally came out of nowhere. The next biggest thing was him ignoring Rey's initial plea for him to return to Leia. In The Empire Strikes Back, Luke did not hesitate to drop his training to go to Bespin and put his life on the line for Leia. Yet, when told inTLJ that Leia needed his help, he told Rey to simply ""Go away"" in a grouchy old man voice. And when told that his lifelong friend Han Solo was murdered by his son, Luke's nephew responsible for Luke's current state of mind, Luke didn't even receive a scene in the movie to mourn. Again, an objectively inconsistent and arguably insulting portrayal of Luke Skywalker. And finally, when Luke ""appears"" on Crait to fight Kylo, it was only a Force Projection from across the galaxy. And he died inexplicably right after doing it. So many issues exist with this thread Im not going to even address it, ultimately it is not different than if Luke went there in person to fight and died holding off the First Order, so why have him Force Project in the first place?

Luke's character in TLJ just makes no sense, it was lazy writing intended to shift the spotlight away from the original hero to the new generation protagonist Rey. Its not necessarily wrong to do this (contrary to popular opinion I think J. J. Abram's Star Trek reboot did this very well), but the way it was done in the Sequel trilogy was lazy and inconsistent with existing material. I hope those who have seen the controversial feud between Sequel lovers and Sequel haters read this with an open mind, and understand my perspective on the matter. 

Now, the main counterargument to all of this is that Luke Skywalker's grumpy and pessimistic nature was a refreshing and unexpected take on his character. Viewers of the movie felt like they could relate to his past failures and improve their own selves. My response to that, is we have already seen the ""dark event in a character's past"" cliche that causes said character to radically shift in behavior, actions or beliefs. We saw this with Yoda, who having been defeated by Emperor Palpatine during his duel in the Senate Building, exiled himself to Dagobah. Even though he did train Luke successfully, prior to that he had accepted failure and his eventual death in solitude. Obi-Wan endured the same relative experience; he dueled his lifelong friend and believed that he has killed him on Mustafar. He then became a hermit himself in the deserts of Tatooine. I am not discrediting Yoda or Obi-Wan's character arcs, they worked beautifully; rather I am explaining that what was done with the Luke's character in TLJ had already been done onscreen with two other characters. It would have been more refreshing to see something more akin to the Luke in Legends, because that portrayal of the successful ""learner becomes the master"" arc had never been done before onscreen.

And all this being said still ignores the actual response from Lucasfilm and Rian Johnson on Twitter to valid criticisms and complaints from fans. Rian, along with actors such as Freddy Prince Jr. harassed fans and insulted them over the platform, generalizing them into labels such as ""white supremacists"" and ""manbabies"". This not only is just inaccurate to call such a large group of diverse people who share the same opinions against a film such harsh terms, but also simply just immature and inappropriate. It was *rude*, and unjustified. This is what I and many others find to be the most reprehensible of the Disney era, the treatment of fans. 

Now, some fans *can* be toxic, that I am not disagreeing with. There ARE toxic fans that hate the Sequels, but to generalize that entire section of that part of the fanbase is just inaccurate. It would be no better if that same thing happened to the Sequel enjoying part of the fanbase. *Its just wrong*. 

George Lucas sold Star Wars because of the initial response to the Prequel trilogy. Original trilogy fans and others absolutely butchered the Prequels, and while they had their flaws, much of the criticism was beyond any level of decency. I personally like to call those fans ""fake fans"", because put simply, you cannot be a true fan while displaying such a great and vitriolic disrespect towards the father of Star Wars himself. Sadly, we have seen a similar experience, but the situation is reversed, with Lucasfilm, Disney and a portion of Sequel trilogy fans decrying and harshly attacking fans with genuine criticisms of something they love.

I say all of this with respect to all Star Wars fans. The Disney era of Star Wars has been, controversial to say the least. My views and my emotions towards the Sequels can be very polarizing, but I wanted to take the time to construct a meaningful explanation of how I and many others view one of the most polarizing aspects of the Sequels, that being their portrayal of Luke. I could've used words such as ""bastardization"" or ""humiliation"", but words mean things. The ""bastardization"" of Luke to me could be the ""heroism"" to another. *That being said*, we sadly live during a time where words can mean too much, and people cry out in fury to silence those they disagree with for their differing opinions and perspectives. There is no middle ground anymore, people simply just aren't decent anymore. I do not want this to continue, I support free open dialogue no matter who may be speaking. I respect the right for others to have opinions and voices just as I hope you respect my rights to the same thing. I want Star Wars to be beloved again, not a barren wasteland of controversy where people walk on egg shells.

I grew up watching the clone wars, and That‚Äôs what attached me. I watched the movies when I was 13 or so. The only movies I had a fresh watch were the sequel movies which I did not like. I decided to rewatch all 6 of the movies in the past week and it‚Äôs been quite something. I liked them, but I didint love them like most people do. PT wasc cool and heartbreaking, but I kind of slept through most of the first despite there being some great scenes. The OT was well written I can say, but it felt really black and white for me. 

I liked the prequels more because they weren‚Äôt so good vs evil thing, but they also fell flat while being executed. My favorite one was probably rogue one in execution and writing. I know some of you are going to think that I‚Äôm super negative and that I‚Äôm just a ‚Äútoxic fan‚Äù who hates the movies, but I really didint find the OT all that appealing. It was made during the 20th century, so that makes sense why it felt like it was just pure black and white. Granted, I don‚Äôt hate the OT, I just found it ok. I just really like when Star Wars dives into complexities, which is seen sometimes like in the game KOTOR 2 and occasionally in the clone wars. 

This is simply my taste for Star Wars, I enjoy more grey stories that makes you question the whole light vs dark thing, and I think kotor 2 did that wonderfully.

Now, it‚Äôs kind of falling the structure of a tv show. (It‚Äôs a tv show that I‚Äôm writing for fun). 

This is kind of the plot summary, it has no effect on the actual post, I‚Äôm just really proud of it. :)

So, it take solace three years after Solo and it‚Äôs about three years after solo. 
The general outline is episode 1 and 2, Han and Chewie are hired to track down some Beskar for hundred-thousand. Over the course of the mission they learn that the Beskar is actually Cortosis and that they‚Äôre being swindled. So, they opt to sell the Cortosis to make more money, and their employer sends Boba Fett to track them down. One thing leads to another and Fett shoots them out of the sky and they end up stranded on a planet. So, they have to sell the Cortosis on that planet, to repair the falcon, while evading Boba Fett. And when they finally do, Han goes to their employer and shoots him. 

3-4
Han and Chewie celebrate their victory only for the Falcon to get stolen while they are. They then realize it‚Äôs on a star destroyer and have to sneak onto it, and after fighting their way off with the falcon, they get shot out of space ‚Äî again. And crash land in Cloud city. Where the meet Lando, who explains he won cloud city in a bet. I know it‚Äôs very coincidental that they landed on cloud city, but I really wanted Lando in it. 

5-6 
They spend awhile in cloud city, before the empire find them, and Lando helps them lead the empire away. 

7-8
After a couple days of evading the empire, Boba Fett finds them, and he and Han have a final fight, which at one point during it, Fett cliches Han‚Äôs chin, to explain Harrison Ford‚Äôs scar, like in Indiana Jones. 

Anyway, sorry for that tangent, I‚Äôm just really excited about this. 

Now, Chewie growls. It‚Äôs a well known fact.

10,I‚Äôve been wanting to get this out for a while,1594842482,"I don‚Äôt quite know if this is the right place for this but here it goes, Star Wars is a vast beautiful universe of stories that has always been meant to be inclusive and let everyone find joy in tales of a galaxy far far away that let us enjoy hope, levity, and a break from reality. The movies, books, comics, video games, Tv shows, heck even the fan stories (the SFW ones are least), are all great and enjoyable. But even if they aren‚Äôt some one out there enjoys them and that‚Äôs what Star Wars is about. There is something in it for everyone, whether in legends, canon or what ever comes next. And I feel that as an overall community we are generally great about that, we acknowledge that even if we don‚Äôt enjoy it some one does and we don‚Äôt want to take that away from them, nor should we. But more recently a not insignificant group of fans have started becoming vile and quite frankly un acceptably disrespectful of portions of Star Wars, in this particular post I am referring to some of the prequel fans and their views towards the sequels. Legends and the sequels both made some mistakes, no one denies that and no one should, that said even George Lucas himself didn‚Äôt like where legends went after return of the Jedi but he knew it didn‚Äôt matter, because those stories brought joy to people and that the galaxy he created was larger than any of us even him. I think that we all need to take some time to think about all the greatness that comes from Star Wars, it‚Äôs a vast story of struggles between light and dark good and evil, a tale everyone can relate to in some form or another, it brings people together, it can inspire young minds to be interested in space and science, and most importantly what it means to all of us. I think that we all need to remember that this epic saga  legends canon or what ever we call it is bigger than any of us, even if we don‚Äôt like something we still need to accept it for all the people who do like it because some one did it before us, someone accepted what you like the most about this amazing story before you did and it‚Äôs or job to pay it forward, take the good with the bad and let people enjoy this beautiful universe we all share.",StarWars,Prudii_Tracyn2,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hrum4u/ive_been_wanting_to_get_this_out_for_a_while/

45,"If You Were to Fix the Last Jedi, What Would You Do?",1594834748,"A lot of people have issues with this movie. Even I, who enjoy it, think it has its issues, but I think that this movie took a break from nostalgia. I deeply think that with a mix of story planning, a HINT of JJ‚Äôs nostalgia mixing, and Rian Johnson‚Äôs editing and cinematography the sequel trilogy would have been way different. I like Rian Johnson a lot more than JJ Abrams, at least he did something different.

If I were to fix the last Jedi I‚Äôd have:

-Finn, Rey, and Poe together the entire time throughout the movie. Maybe they‚Äôd communicate on base to Leia once in awhile. Maybe there could be two subplots that tie in together, like Finn and Poe on base with Leia, then Rey and Luke on the island and they meet up a quarter through the plot. We need unity throughout the team, especially since last movie, Rey hadn‚Äôt even met Poe (or they could meet at the end of Force Awaken??) 

-I think we should give Kylo Ren actual motivation for taking over the galaxy other than he hates his family. That‚Äôs stupid.

-Rey‚Äôs character should be more developed, I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs a Mary Sue in the Force Awaken, but they really drove it home here. I also like that she‚Äôs a nobody. 

-If we took away ALL the Cantobight crap, I don‚Äôt know, but Rose would have as much point in the plot as Babu Frick is TROS. I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôd need her if we outline the story more. There‚Äôs no reason to add another ‚ÄòLando‚Äô if it doesn‚Äôt call for the story

-I think that Luke would be hiding to try to find something to help the Resistance but since in my hypothetical movie, Rey is a bit untrustworthy of him, because he‚Äôs LUKE SKYWALKER and he needs to go SAVE HIS FAMILY. But Luke would be a mix of Yoda, Obi-Wan, and his old farm boy self.

-I do think if they hadn‚Äôt had Kylo Ren torture Rey in the first one, Reylo would be better received in general. It‚Äôs a cool, different concept for Star Wars. If if we were to hypothetically change nothing of the Force Awakens, we‚Äôd have Kylo Ren set on beating Rey to get to the goal. And then they force speak, but I think this is where Kylo‚Äôs OTHER motivation than ‚ÄúI hate my family,‚Äù might appeal to Rey. After all, maybe Kylo could tell Rey some bad stuff Han Solo did as a smuggler (it could tie in with why he was at the cantina in A New Hope) 

-I think that Rey turning to the dark side (from all her revelations) is a good plot line. Finn and Poe (her friends, must mostly Finn) would have to find a way to turn her back near the end.

-This would also set up the TROS where I think the concept of ‚Äúgrey jedi‚Äù is the better end to the Skywalker Saga.",StarWars,leavemeinpeace10,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hrs38m/if_you_were_to_fix_the_last_jedi_what_would_you_do/

75,Here‚Äôs a what if scenario for a possible different way The Rise of Skywalker could have gone in the script.,1594828385,"I had several problems with TROS but most of them could have been easily fixed. The biggest problem that I‚Äôve had is the main villain. Now some problems with this are that the Palpatine reveal was really out of nowhere. Plus it undoes everything Anakin and Luke accomplished in the OT which kind of crushed Anakin being the chosen one. Here‚Äôs what I was thinking, Maybe instead of bringing palpatine back to life they brought back a different villain. The first person who came to my mind was Vitiate. The immortal emperor of the second sith empire, and student to the emperor of the first empire. This would have been great but perhaps would require too much exposition and Disney recanonizing too much lost content. Maybe they could have brought back the Rakatan infinite empire. This was something I like less than the first idea but more plausible. They could mention in TLJ that snoke was a big history buff like palpatine and studied the rakatans. And he finally found a way to revive them or perhaps they froze an army in stasis in the past. I would like to have seen that, but it seems like something that couldn‚Äôt be solved in the runtime of one movie. Here is one I think more people could agree with. The brother from the clone wars, I think the main villain turning out to be Vitiate would have been my preferred ending but the brother makes the most sense. Plus this one actually has a connection to the skywalkers. Is there anyone in particular you would have liked to see instead of palps?

92,True reason why EP. 9 was so bad.,1594825479,"7 and 8 were acceptable, even though shit ton of forced propaganda 
problem with them was lack of classic star wars environment and acting. 
mainly ep 9 looked like a jumanji or something. 

So people blame director for doing bad job and not following the casual path of sw franchise. While he might not be a good director, it was not his fault. 

It was also not directly linked to lack of time they had for filming. 

It was intentional. 

I have no proof but thought it is pretty obvious they might either intentionally ruin such a popular franchise, intentionally made people desperately crave for a good sw so they can later give us the Mandalorian. 

As you may know, Mandalorian is only available on Disney + which is paid service. 
This was a marketing strategy because Disney can apparently put effort in something that will make a lot money. 

They even had less time for Mandalorian and still managed to polish it as if they had more time. 

Which brings me to conclusion they either used the un - success of sw9 to ""redeem"" and satisfy the fans and basically made easy money or did it entirely on purpose and made fans blame J. J.

95,A couple issues with the sequel trilogy I think I have the answer to,1594824349,"I loved the sequel trilogy it could have been better yes but cause nothing would make me hate any Star Wars movie as I love Star Wars so much...unless Palpatine won in the end that would suck...but there were two major issues with it that some fans weren't happy with which I think I've found solutions for. A disclaimer, I normally don't notice flaws in movies until others point them out and I am on the autistic spectrum so often interpret things in the world differently to others.

Luke throwing away the Skywalker lightsaber in the Last Jedi made a lot of fans mad after that cliffhanger and him dissing his Jedi heritage just for funny moment. However I thought him doing that was a big twist on what was expected and also showed us that he had changed a lot over the years. This change gave a big challenge to Rey to get him to return to how he was before and in Rise of Skywalker he was redeemed with ""A Jedi's weapon deserves more respect."" Like character development changes characters so I'm quite confused at how some fans weren't happy with him flipping his mood. I did however see one comment on youtube saying he might have thrown away the lightsaber as it was the one he used on Bespin when he learnt Vader was his father and lost his hand so associated with trauma. 

The next thing is Rey calling herself a Skywalker despite not being a Skywalker by blood and a Palpatine instead. Me and some other fans argued that it was more than blood that makes family with how Luke and Leia trained her as a Jedi and were more like family than Palpatine who is the satan of the galaxy and not someone Rey would want to remember being linked to. But then I thought maybe she calling herself Skywalker WASN'T making herself a member of the family that were now all dead, but rather starting a new family line named after the Skywalkers. It's like not everyone called Smith are part of the same family that's a common surname.

TLDR: Luke throwing away the lightsaber then treating it with respect was a major character development arc presenting a challenge to the plot of restoring the old Jedi to how he used to be and Rey calling herself Skywalker might have been naming herself and whoever comes after her after the Skywalkers and not being part of the Skywalker family kind of like how having the surname Smith doesn't make you connected to all Smiths.",StarWars,Atalkingpizzabox,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hrov4n/a_couple_issues_with_the_sequel_trilogy_i_think_i/

85,Rey is a mary sue and Luke is not.,1594783248,"Reasons why she is,

Rey

No explanation on why she is that powerful in the first film

Bad story writing,

Beats the crap out of every enemy with barely any assistance at all shown on screen. It's like just creating a character and using a boost to max level and clearing all missions.

Doesnt care for others episode 7 etc all sequels ""she doesnt want bb8 fully, she didnt help out the other residence in jakku, doesnt care for her surroundings at home and somewhat other places, Yes I know she healed kylo but that only served plot and reylo fans :/""

Luke why he is not,

Is assisted on blowing up the deathstar by obiwan kenobi,

doesnt fight vader in episode 4,

doesnt win at bespin at episode 5

Gets his arm cut off in episode 5

Experience loss that actually means a lot to him ""It felt like he was a some sort of father, meanwhile anakin,"" episode 4

Capture leia plan failed partially, episode 4

Makes a crap ton of mistakes in books and in the films and etc.

And one of the most used excuses I mostly hear to defend her is that ""she is awesome"" just awesome. Mostly nothing else. The only people that I know that like her are mostly sjw, feminist, racist ""mostly because of finn, amidst rian johnsson joking keeping him in a concussion."" Kathleen Kennedy, The Pro Kathleen Kennedy team at Lucas Films, Some hard fans, not all.

In conclusion, Luke is not perfect. He grew as a character and improved in the films, He grew to fight Darth Vader and eventually in a way saving him. He is not a perfect character in any way. So Mary Sue doesnt apply here. People call him the name because they are hypocrites and say calling Rey is sexist but calling Luke one is not :/ Rey, Most definitely. She Lived by herself, Mostly cares only for herself. And it's not explained on why she has full skills on screen. She goes from a staff to a blaster and to a lightsaber with the only training on screen being a leaf. Kathleen Kennedy just make characters with good righting. And not bad ones.

In my opinion I like Finn and Kylo better because at least they were interesting and they could have made Finn gay and made it more interesting but then the Chinese government did not like Finn for being black so Disney bended there knees.

96,"If you could write your own Episode IX, what would it consist of?",1594779594,"I'd have found it interesting if it focused much more on Kylo Ren's redemption. The main plot would consist of Kylo trying to take Snoke's place and ruining the First Order terribly until Hux stages a coup with every Stormtrooper, which would backfire in a full scale uprising like in Duel of the Fates. That way the Hux/Kylo rivalry would come to a conclusion while Hux stays loyal to the First Order. After that, the Knights of Ren abandon him and he turns to the light after a conversation with Han identical to the one in TROS, where Luke and Anakin welcome him with open arms.

Poe would be in charge of the Resistance while Finn travels the galaxy showing planets the atrocities committed by the growing First Order. Those feel like the natural paths for their characters after Poe's lesson in TLJ and Finn's origin.

Rey would be organizing a new Jedi Order under Obi Wan's, Luke's, and Leia's guidance. She would also have trouble with leadership. Maybe Qui Gon could come in and teach her to move beyond the flaws of the Order he was a part of.

Something I think would be neat but not necessary is the First Order invading the Unknown Regions so the Chiss join the fight.

Overall, I think a theme of leadership is something that hasn't been explored much in Star Wars as a whole and barely at all in the movies.

45,Pong Krell Gamemode Idea For The Next Battlefront (Unfinished),1594765477,"# Pong Krell's Betrayal

**Pong Krell** has betrayed the Republic! Tricking the clones into killing their own, Pong Krell is on the run and must be stopped before he can join the Separatists Alliance. Hidden within the dense Umbara forests, the clones must locate and eliminate the traitor before he escapes or kills them all.

The map will be pretty big. Every player is spawned randomly around the map in small groups. Clones don‚Äôt pick up Pong Krell on their minimap but Pong Krell does. When a clone shoots at Pong Krell and does damage to either his lightsaber block or him, his teammates can see which direction it came from on the mini map. After 15 seconds of being hidden, Pong Krell is spotted on the mini map increasingly until its his exact location. Engaging in combat stops this and leaving combat resets the timer.

This gamemode is essentially a 1 v 25

The Clones have 80 lives. If they lose all of them players cannot respawn. If Pong Krell kills all of the clones or stays alive for 15 minutes he wins. If he is killed the clones win. Earn battle points by finding or damaging Pong Krell

\-**Captain Rex**(will be worked on after I finish the original Battlefront 2 heroes/villains)can be deployed but costs battle points. Has his star cards and can be leveled up.

\-Clones have access to all of their classes and star cards. Clones have the ARC Trooper reinforcement that costs battle points. There can be 5 of them.

# Pong Krell

\-**Pong Krell** has 900 health and does 125 damage with his lightsabers.

\-Killing an enemy starts health regeneration.

\-Has 2 dodges with a 80% increased cool down.

\-Pong Krell has a 20% damage reduction to enemies within 5 meters of him.

\-Killing enemies grants 5% stamina.

\-Blocking blaster fire has a reduced stamina cost at first but over time drains more quickly. Starts with 25% stamina reduction and can go up to a 25% increased stamina drain. For every 50 damage blocked, stamina drain is increased by 5%. Resets after not blocking for 5 seconds.

\-His attacks drain 15% less stamina.

\-Pong Krell can use two of his arms to grab his enemy within 2 meters of him and deal 50% more lightsaber damage(Right stick for controllers). Cool down 20 seconds

His left ability is **Duel Throw**. Pong Krell can throw both of his lightsabers doing 15 more damage than his main attacks. Can throw one at a time or both after one is thrown. Cool down for one lightsaber throw is 10 seconds. Throwing the other increases the cool down for both by 2 seconds. Throw distance is 15 meters.

His middle ability is **Surround Me**. Pong Krell can force **Pull** or **Push** enemies within a 8 meter radius around him(If using a controller, Y or Triangle switches between the two). Each does 50 damage. Each has a cool down of 35 seconds. Using both increases the cool down time by 15 seconds.

His right ability is **Silent Step**. His footsteps are silent and the enemies minimaps show him in every direction while also being taunted from every direction. His movement speed is increased by 20%. Increases stamina regain by 25%.

8,Serious question to people who like both Last Jedi and Rise of Skywalker; how do you reconcile the two movies?,1594754281,"I'm confused. I, for one, really like Last Jedi. It's daring and character-driven, and Snoke getting killed to make way for Kylo Ren's descent into crazy was genius.

However, Rise of Skywalker in no way built off of the foundation that had been laid. It consciously avoided answering the questions posed by Last Jedi.

Now, I can understand liking Rise of Skywalker because it was fast-paced, because you wanted to see Kylo Ren redeemed, because of the nostalgia of seeing Palpatine, etc. However, I struggle to understand liking them both. Sure, it's okay to like more than one kind of movie, but these two movies blatantly contradict each other to the point that, for me, you almost have to choose which one is the 'real' final movie in the Star Wars saga.

Not looking for a flame war here, I would just genuinely like to hear from people who are comfortable with both movies, because I can't imagine them as anything but at odds with each other, practically demanding that you choose one or the other.",StarWars,TheT-Rexr,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hr7x2m/serious_question_to_people_who_like_both_last/

39,Who‚Äôs Stoked for the Bad Batch series? Here‚Äôs my burning questions and plot predictions. What are yours?,1594748495,"With the exciting announcement of the upcoming *Star Wars: The Bad Batch* Animated series dropping in 2021, I thought it would be fun to ask some questions and theorize on what the show will be about. What kind of hijinks Hunter, Wrecker, Crosshair, Tech and Echo get into? Let‚Äôs explore!

First a few burning questions about Clone Force 99:

**1. Did the Bad Batch remove their inhibitor chips?** If so, when and how? I feel Tech will be the answer to all of this. Maybe he figures it out as order 66 is happening, or found the chip years ago and removed it not knowing it‚Äôs true purpose.

**2. In the press release it revealed that they will be mercenaries, but who will they be working for?** Who do they align with after the fall of the Republic? I think we‚Äôll see them taking all kinds of jobs from either the Alliance, Empire or the syndicates.¬† Throughout these jobs they will slowly start to eek out a living and find a purpose for their lives.¬†

**3. Do they age the same as other clones?** The BB are unique, maybe in more ways than we think. They could age slower or faster than the other clones. This could open up possibilities of their stories exploring further time periods beyond the aftermath of the clone wars.

**Now it‚Äôs time to speculate!** Based on the info provided by Lucasfilm and my own half-assed knowledge of the Star Wars universe, this is what I predict for the shows plot:

The Bad Batch will start with a flashback of the cloning process on Kamino. The BB clones will nearly be discarded before Kaminoan notices their unique abilities. They will be separated from the core clones and trained and experimented on to eventually become the venerable Clone Force 99.¬†

Flash-forward to the present time. Order 66 is executed, and Hunter senses the ensuing chaos. The Batch doesn‚Äôt turn on the Jedi because Tech had already removed their inhibitor chips. Echo still has his chip, so the Batch use him to figure out more about the Palpabtine‚Äôs plans before removing his chip as well.

The boys will try to help their brethren, but ultimately the task will be too much for them to handle and they retreat to the unknown regions.

This is where the brunt of the show will start. Force 99 will hop around throughout the fringes of the galaxy taking any mercenary work to stay afloat. Tech eventually has a breakthrough and figures out how to easily deactivate chips remotely.¬†

The crew now aims to start liberating as many of their brainwashed brothers as possible.

The latter half of the show will focus on the Batch liberating clones and setting up a free clone colony hidden in the unknown regions of the galaxy.

The Bad Batch will go to any lengths to protect their fellow clones, even if it means close encounters with the empire, the inquisitors or anyone else that may harm the clones.

There you go, that‚Äôs my early prediction for the show. Where do you think the show will go? What characters do you think will make an appearance? Ahsoka? Maul?¬†

61,Parallels between Kylo and Rey's fighting styles: symmetries or poor choreography?,1594744239,"Hello there! I just saw on Twitter [this video](https://twitter.com/adambsolodriver/status/1282108528199688193) in which are shown some similarities between Kylo and Rey's fighting styles. Is it a way their dyad is showing or is it just bad choreography?

Let's consider some facts.

Kylo is well trained, first by Luke and then (probably) by Snoke. He's been handling a lightsaber since a very young age. He has discipline and  technique. On the other hand, Rey is a self-taught fighter. She shouldn't even know how to switch on Luke's saber. She has no technique at all, so her fighting comes from her ""heart"", from her instincts. I don't think she knows how to handle a lightsaber because she was used to her long stick, because it's a very different weapon. 

There's no way you can consider Rey a master in the art of lightsaber fighting. Think about how much Anakin had to train (basically from his childhood to his maturity) and yet, as we all know, he was not granted the rank of Master. At the same time Kylo's fighting stile is not traditional, but rather erratic and uncontrolled, which is understandable for what he's going through; however, if we consider Anakin's fighting at the and of Episode III it's much more disciplined even though he's absolutely ferocious. 

I've seen someone say that it's because they were both trained by Luke, but that's not true. Kylo was, Rey actually wasn't. She didn't even complete the three steps of her Jedi journey with Luke, and it wasn't about fighting but about spirituality.

Many people consider these fighting styles similar because it's a way for their dyad to be showing. But how are they so similar if Kylo's over-trained and Rey is not trained at all? This reading would overestimate Rey and underestimate Kylo. 

As much as I'd love to believe it's a nice parallel, I honestly think it's just a matter of bad choreography. There's not much going on. It's not a difficult fighting style, technically speaking.

He was sweating. He didn‚Äôt like sweating. It suggested hard work, something he wasn‚Äôt fond of, and just didn‚Äôt give the impression of someone who was infinitely cool, infinitely in control.""

That just seems like Lando to me. No matter what he wants to at least appear like he's the man in charge even if things are blowing up around him. Speaking of blowing up around him the scene is quickly followed by one of my other favorite Lando moments 

""Lando grabbed him by the collar of his tunic and dragged him close. The trooper had to be younger than twenty, despite his apparent poise. ‚ÄúListen to me, bantha fodder,‚Äù Lando said. ‚ÄúI blew up a Death Star before you were born. In twenty seconds I can conclude a conversation with General Antilles, who blew up that Death Star with me, and I‚Äôll be General Calrissian again, and and you‚Äôll spend the rest of your military career cleaning refreshers on Kessel. Or you can dig. Which is it?‚Äù

The trooper looked at him for one long moment, during which streaks of plasma began to look like solid lines in the air above them. ‚ÄúI guess we dig, sir.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight.‚Äù Lando released him. He looked at the Twi‚Äôlek engineer and gestured at the trooper. ‚ÄúGive him your shovel.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, sir.‚Äù

Lando stretched out, took up his blaster rifle, and took the trooper‚Äôs place at the perimeter. He fired a few times at distant Yuuzhan Vong warriors and once at the creature. Then he turned to his bodyguard and smiled. ‚ÄúYou know, that‚Äôs the kind of worker negotiations I really love.‚Äù

60,Why do people consider darth sidious to be smarter than Thrawn?,1594706525,"I‚Äôm not the most well versed in legends, but it seems clear to me that thrawn is the most intelligent character in the galaxy by far. Palpatine orchestrated his rise to power beautifully of course, but he did so because he had something thrawn lacked: an obsession with gaining as much power as possible. If thrawn were to have similar ambitions, I don‚Äôt see why he couldn‚Äôt do so successfully even without the force. Thrawn has been shown to be absurdly, superhumanly intelligent. It‚Äôs ridiculous how brilliant he is at everything he puts his mind to with seemingly little difficulty. 

This isn‚Äôt an argument for my point, but i find the most interesting thing about thrawn to be his incredible success among the most powerful people in the galaxy without being force sensitive. I know palpatine is a caricature of a villain anyway, but it just doesn‚Äôt seem fair that he‚Äôs the strongest force user in the films and in legends (tied with or above yoda and well below full chosen one potential realized, grandmaster Luke obviously) the emperor of the galaxy, and apparently the smartest being inhabiting it.

67,What if: Obi-Wan becomes Darth Vader,1594701816,"I think it would be neat if Disney decided to do a What-if series in the animation style of Clone wars. The first of which I think should be a ‚ÄúWhat if Anakin did go and confront Maul on Mandalore‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhat it Obi-Wan became Darth Vader instead‚Äù both end at the same conclusion and I‚Äôll explain below.


Leading up to this event, Obi-wan and Anakin would have had a brief encounter with Maul in which he kills several innocents on his way back to Mandalore. After escaping Obi-wan and Anakin, Obi-wan pleads with the Jedi council to provide resources for a mission to hunt down and finally bring Maul to justice. The council refuses, having been stretched too thin at the time with politically fueled missions on nearby planets, and orders Anakin and Obi-wan back to Courscant for assignment. This irritates Obi-wan, feeling that striking while the iron is hot and capturing an already compromised Maul would be East and will save innocent lives he has and will take again. 

When Ahsoka goes to ask Anakin for help capturing Maul, Obi-wan denies this request. Anakin looks apologetically at Ahsoka who is aggravated by the old wise Jedi‚Äôs stubbornness. In a moment of clarity, Obi-wan experiences flashbacks to both Qui-gon‚Äôs and Satine‚Äôs death as well as the innocents Maul slaughtered. Obi-wan remembers how the council denied his request to hunt down Maul, and in an unheard of moment of spontaneity and lack of better judgement, Obi-wan turns around and tells Ahsoka that he and Anakin will go and Capture Maul. Ahsoka is shocked but not as shocked as Anakin who barely recognizes the defiant behavior of his master. Obi-wan tells Ahsoka that there is a catch, She is to go in their stead to rescue Chancellor Palpatine while Anakin and him go to Mandalore. Ahsoka protests but Obi-wan states that Maul is far too powerful for her to take alone and a score must be settled between them. Anakin again shoots a sideways glance at Obi-wan that he does not notice. That statement is completely out of character for his master. Anakin promises Ahsoka that they will take care of Maul.

On Mandalore, Anakin and Obi-wan face off against Maul. During the battle Maul tells Anakin of his inevitable fall to the dark side and the pain and suffering he will inflict on the galaxy but does not name Palpatine as Anakin‚Äôs master and the puppeteer of this dark path. This triggers a vision where Anakin sees that he is the one who causes Padme‚Äôs death, orchestrated by Palpatine. Overwhelmed by this, Anakin purposely lets his guard down to Maul in the heat of the duel and is struck down to save his wife and unborn children from himself

Obi-wan, in a fit of rage viciously cuts down Maul for the final time. Maul is smiling menacingly as Obi-wan brings his lightsaber down on Maul‚Äôs collarbone, cutting his torso diagonally in half, Monks Robe cut style . Obi-wan then rushes to Anakins side and the final word that Anakin manages to utter is ‚ÄúPalpatine‚Äù. Obi-wan, who at the time had little to no suspicion of Palpatine as the Sith master, takes these words as sign that Anakin wanted Obi-wan to believe like he did that Palpatine was a good person and was an opportunity for change in the republic and the Jedi. After Anakin‚Äôs death, Obi-wan begins to blame the Jedi Council for Anakin‚Äôs death for not having prioritized the capture of the known former Sith and dark side user in the past.

Ahsoka, having saved the Chancellor during the battle over Coruscant, slaying Grievous but allowing Dooku to escape, hears of Anakin‚Äôs death and rejoins the Jedi to honor Anakin. Ahsoka feels guilty for listening to Obi-wan and taking orders to go on a mission concerning politics and saving the Chancellor, rather than accompanying and possibly saving Anakin. She goes to visit Padme after Anakin‚Äôs death, and knowing that Anakin trusted Ahsoka, Padme reveals that she is pregnant with his child. An estranged Obi-wan distances himself from Ahsoka and the rest of the council.

Obi-wan is in a compromised state and has had to confront his desire for revenge and the doubt he has of the Jedi. He‚Äôs been stripped of his will to keep at bay the desire to confront the emotions of something as painful as the Jedi order being responsible for his lover‚Äôs and Padawan‚Äôs death. Obi-wan begins to lash out at fellow Jedi, harshly reacts to clone troopers mishaps or failings and questions and challenges master Yoda and master Windu‚Äôs wise council. During a mission, Obi-wan in passing tells a clone who is relaying the news of s prisoner‚Äôs escape, to shoot himself in the foot and the clone does so. Obi-wan Is briefly shocked, but then intrigued at his accidental coercion of the clone and smirks cruelly. He quickly comes back to his senses and is horrified at how he could be so cruel as to enjoy hurting someone. He attends to the clones injury who is ignorant to what has just happened. The injured clone and those who rush in after the blaster fire chalk it up to be weapons mishap. 

Obi-wan is then seen deep in thought, contemplating his accidental implanting of the suggestion in the clones head to shoot himself. He recalls the time he spent as a youngling and padawan being trained in the ways of the force and how he spent years honing his abilities and controlling them and that this accidental use of his powers is similar to how he was then, raw and unstable. 

Obi-wan goes to speak to Palpatine about Anakin‚Äôs passing finally, wishing to understand what his apprentice saw in him. After mourning Anakin and exchanging words over his passing, Palpatine mentions Obi-wan seems cold, troubled and less formal and proper than usual. Obi-wan hesitantly explains he has been feeling guilty over Anakin‚Äôs death. Palpatine prods at this statement, saying its ‚Äúonly natural‚Äù that Obi-wan would feel guilty but that it was the Jedi who mishandled Mauls capture these past years and allowed him to run rampant, slaying Qui-gon, Satine, and now Anakin. Obi-wan looks up when he hears these names, looking back down then hesitantly saying that Anakin shared a similar viewpoint of the Jedi, that it handled things in the wrong manner, and could be improved upon. 

Palpatine tells Obi-wan the Jedi go unchecked in the galaxy and champion their emotionless, disconnected sense of morality which only ends up hurting them and others and has been twisted. It creates a divide in the hearts of Jedi who would otherwise think with a level head and use their emotions in their favor instead of burying them. Palpatine digresses, ‚Äúbut this is all just my opinion‚Äù Palpatine then doubles back saying ‚Äúbut, it does raise concern, limiting such a powerful being such as a force user from acting on natural emotions seems like it would brew catastrophe, who knows the pain a troubled Force user could unintentionally inflict when pushed past their breaking point‚Äù. Obi-wan thinks back to the incident with the clone. When normally not swayed whatsoever by someone like Palpatine, Obi-wan is desperately looking for any explanation of his distrust of the Jedi and his recent unintended Jedi mind trick he could not control. 

Obi-wan latches onto the Chancellor‚Äôs words. He is easily swayed after this to believe Palpatine is the only hope at correcting the Jedi order due to his wanting to honor Anakin‚Äôs wishes of the reformation of the Jedi. 

Over the course of this new ROTS, Obi-wan would become convinced over time by Palpatine‚Äôs frequent ramblings about Master Yoda‚Äôs connection to Dooku that Yoda might be the unknown Sith master. At a council meeting, Mace Windu and Ahsoka are sent to find and capture Dooku. Yoda is sent to Kashyyyk. Obi-wan is left at the temple due to Dooku deeming Obi-wan unfit because of recent behavior changes they‚Äôve become concerned about, possibly due to his apprentice‚Äôs passing. Sitting in the Jedi Council chambers by himself, fueling his own distrust, Obi-wan begins to hypothesize that Yoda could in fact be the Sith Lord due to his allowing Dooku to escape on Geonosis. This solidifies Obi-wans distrust of the council.

Obi-wan secretly goes to Kashyyyk to murder Yoda, believing him to be the Sith master. He finds Yoda meditating on a vision of a dark future he sees of 2 shadowy figures looming over the Jedi temple and is in a deep state of pain, overwhelmed by what he sees. Obi-wan would then catch Yoda off guard and stab him in the back, Obi-wan is overcome with remorse for murdering the Jedi Master and flees, leaving quickly to return to Palpatine, the only person who he could think of to go to for council. Palpatine tells Obi-wan he is carrying out Anakin‚Äôs will. Palpatine then calmly reveals that Yoda was not the sith master, but he was. Obi-Wan is stricken with guilt, but Palpatine begins telling Obi-wan it was the Jedi who allowed Anakin to be murdered after mishandling the capture of Maul, so who was the real villain of the galaxy? Was it Palpatine for simply seeking radical reformation and a new order by wiping the slate clean, or the Jedi for its military occupation of the galaxy via clones and all powerful, all good Jedi who go unchecked? Was killing Master Yoda not justice for Anakin‚Äôs death?

Sidious tells Obi-wan that he knew what Anakins‚Äôs last words were and that he would have been here at their side this very moment if not for the Jedi and Obi-wans blind following of the Jedi way. Sidious tells Obi-wan that he could redeem himself by finishing what Anakin started. Obi-wan pledges fealty to Palpatine and dons the title of Darth ________. Darth _____ asks Sidious about Dooku to which Sidious quickly retorts that hes being dealt with as they speak, all a part of his plan. 

On an Unknown planet, Ahsoka and Windu battle Dooku. A light show of red, purple and blue sabers, Dooku is impaled through the chest from Ahsoka and through the back by Windu. In similar fashion to ROTS, Obi-wan is sent to kill the jedi at the temple but also, to ‚Äúuse his speciality to retrieve the younglings‚Äù. Mace Windu and Ahsoka, on their way back from defeating Dooku, receive transmission from Kashyyyk that Yoda was cut down by lightsaber. The transmission is cut short abruptly by the clone on Kashyyyk. Clones on Ahsoka‚Äôs and Windu‚Äôs ship raise their blasters to the two Jedi and Ahsoka quickly disarms them and knocks them unconscious. 

On their way back to Coruscant, Ahsoka has to convince Windu that they should not kill the clones because they are being manipulated, Windu is reluctant, and sees no point in wasting time on the treasonous clones. They arrive back to the Temple and find all jedi knights and masters who were present, dead, and the younglings missing. They check the holograms which reveal it was Obi-wan who killed the Jedi and used a powerful Jedi mind trick to coerce the padawans to come with him. 

Ahsoka and Windu would then arrive at Palpatine‚Äôs office to ensure his safety where they see footage of Palpatine‚Äôs confession of being the Sith Lord in question and Obi-wans proclamation of destroying the Jedi and forging a new order. Mace Windu directs Ahsoka to hunt down and end Darth _______ and tells her it is paramount that she set aside the ideals of mercy for the clones she preached about to him on the ship back to coruscant. He tells Ahsoka she must harness and control her anger if only for now and eliminate Obi-wan by whatever means so that they can save the padawans, the Jedi order, and defeat this new Darth _______. 

Windu goes to kill Sidious in the galactic senate chamber. Sidious tells Windu that Obi-wan‚Äôs strengths as a Jedi lay in his dedication to the jedi code, but that his true untapped potential in the ways of the force as Darth _______ were suppressed and had yet to be harnessed fully due to the faulty jedi ways. Windu says that Obi-wan has been engulfed by the dark side, and that Jedi in the past have been able to find inner balance and be at peace with dark urges and even harness them when absolutely necessary without succumbing to the dark side. Sidious cackles and the two duel for sometime until Sidious is disarmed of one light saber and his other arm cut off completely. Sidious looks at Windu, shocked, and uses force lighting which Windu deflects and then says ‚ÄúI am one of them‚Äù and beheads Sidious.

On Mustafar, Ahsoka arrives and is greeted joyously by a wide-eyed Obi-wan who is smiling ear to ear. Ahsoka is weary and notices that this is not the charismatic witty Obi-wan that she is familiar with but one that appears to be in a state of psychotic bliss. Ahsoka draws her lightsaber, Obi-wan circles her and keeps up the jovial act at a distance, and tells her that he has finally succeeded in honoring Anakin‚Äôs will and finding balance between light and dark. He asks her to join him but Ahsoka declines and says Anakin would never have done what you did. Obi-wan turns off the act and his face goes cold and emotionless, his brow drops and he draws his lightsaber, as well as Anakin‚Äôs lightsaber and assumes his signature lightsaber stance but instead of his hand pointing forward with 2 fingers out, he points with Anakin‚Äôs lightsaber instead. 

They begin their duel in similar fashion to ROTS except with 4 blue sabers flailing endlessly. The similarities stop there though because The fight is not so evenly matched as it was with Anakin and Obi-wan, the two Jedi have quite different styles. Obi-wan has the upper hand almost the entire fight and disarms Ahsoka‚Äôs shoto half way through. Ahsoka cannot bring herself to channel her anger to defeat Obi-wan. Towards the end, Obi-wan bests Ahsoka by slashing her face and blinding her left eye. 

Ahsoka flees, and returns to Windu at Polis Massa. Windu asks if she located the padawans to which Ahsoka quietly replies no. She then sees that Padme is there and Ahsoka is momentarily confused as to why, her mind is still dwelling on her failure on Mustafar. Ahsoka‚Äôs eye suddenly opens wide and she realizes why Padme is there right as Windu explains it to us. Windu had suspected Anakin‚Äôs and Padme‚Äôs relationship for a long time and brought her here to keep Anakin‚Äôs child safe as they would undoubtedly be force sensitive and if Darth ______ had collected and coerced the padawans at the temple, he would certainly be looking to abduct more force sensitive children, especially his slain friend and apprentice‚Äôs child if he ever found out about them. 

Darth ______ arrives back on Coruscant and finds Sidious dead. He takes up both Sidious‚Äôs red light sabers and a holodeck device which contains information only Sidious and the separatists were aware of: the Death Star. 

Padme goes into hiding on Tatooine with the Owen family. Mace Windu stays close by for protection. Ahsoka says she is going to go into hiding as well to find peace for her failure to save her master, and stop Darth ______.

A training center inside the Death Star is shown with Darth _______ siting atop a throne with his hand held out using the force on something off screen, he seems to be unamused and has a blank stare on his face, almost seeming bored. The camera would then pan over to one of the younglings in black garb suspended in the air being mind probed/tortured with the force. Other younglings in the back are training combatives with red lightsabers against droids. There is a mark on the youngling‚Äôs face who is being tortured, implying he failed to dodge or deflect a training droid and was struck, and is being disciplined for it. 

On an unknown planet, we see Ahsoka meditating in silence for a moment, she has a cloth bandage over her left eye. Zooming in on her face a moment more and then a blue light shines on her from off camera. Her eye opens and we pan to see a force ghost Yoda sitting on a log, Ahsoka smiles.

Edit: Also could have Ahsoka staying on Tatooine instead of Windu, that kind of makes more sense tbh but I like the idea of Ahsoka taking on the Yoda type role.

93,Saddest Line in all of Star Wars,1594698002,"‚ÄúMaul realized he was older.‚Äù

Bear with me on this one.

When this line was said in episode 10 of the last Clone Wars season it struck me as incredibly sad. It conveyed so much of the message of the Clone Wars and how the show was really a tragedy. It matured with its audience, and delivered an ending that was meaningful but also tragic...the bad guys won and almost every character you grow to love in the show is now dead or evil.

What makes this line so sad? It conveys both the horror of what the Clones were made for and put through by those they served and also the reminder of the loss the viewer has gone through. 

First, it portrays the dark reality of the clone army that the movies did not. They were made to be expendable, but it soon became apparent to the Jedi, the clones, and the viewers themselves that they were anything but. Because of the accelerated aging, they were essentially child soldiers. Sterling refers to Jesse as older, a way that a 9 year old might see a 12 year old (about around their real ages).

Second, the viewer is reminded that aside from Rex, Jesse is the only ‚Äúolder‚Äù clone left (from the 501). All other characters have died... Fives, Tup, Hardcase, etc. This small line reminds the viewer of that. It parallels actually history, where soldiers that had survived until 45 were surrounded by replacements, almost a completely new unit! These replacements were often only a few years younger, but those view years were quite a gap in that context as in the Clone Wars.

TLDR Those five words remind the viewer both of the horror of using the clones as soldiers and the cost of war which the audience as seen, many beloved characters no longer being around in the show. That is why I think it is the saddest line in all of Star Wars... well, that and ‚ÄúNoooooooooooooooo!‚Äù",StarWars,AAJBatteries,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hqu74t/saddest_line_in_all_of_star_wars/

First when the Resistance arrives I will tell the star destroyers to fire all weapons at the Resistance. Even when they go to the same altitude as the star destroyers I will tell them to switch to point defense cannons and ion cannons, no turbolasers. All TIE Fighters have to be deployed.

When the ground crew lands on the Steadfast to destroy the antenna, i'd transmit the signal back to the tower, and have a turbolaser fire on the landed ship, I don't care if the Steadfast suffers some damage, it can take a few hits. The last few Resistance members will be easily dealt with.

When Lando's fleet arrives, the obvious solution comes. Focus most of the fire on the fighters. Xyston Class Star Destroyers have more point defense cannons than regulaur star destroyers. A few destroyers will be lost, but we all knew that would happen. Anyway, once enough fighters have been dealt with we can begin firing on the fleet. The star destroyers can chare their superlasers a little bit and the Resistance is done for. Then the Final Order fleet can flee Excegol win.

36,why i think the new bad batch series will have a much darker tone then rebels.,1594688079,"1. despite doubts from the fandom early on (when the first clone wars season 7 trailer dropped) disney, and lucasfilm under disney, showed a willingness to greenlight  darker scenes then what was seen in rebels, such as the maul hallway scene and the clones getting slaughtered in the sewers. 
2. the representation of the title card, with it being  a rusted grey that seems to have intense corrosion. this s presentation alone suggests a darker, and grittier take on ealry empire days then what we got in rebels. 

&amp;#x200B;

honestly, i am pretty excited for this series, i really trust dave filoni to do good by these characters, and we all know how amazing he is at writing characters (see: mandalore arc, which he himself wrote)  and as states above, disney seems willing to go the darker route after seeing success with the darker tone and elements in clone wars with the maul scene.

MANDALORIAN S2

When the Mandalorian first came out, I was immediately an avid fan of it. So much so, that it is so far the only streaming exclusive series I‚Äôve ever watch more than once (first time by myself, second time with my mom.) So, when I found out that there was going to be a season 2 of the show, I was not surprised seeing how much of a success it was, but admittedly still excited. But as I started to hear more news in terms of returning characters and castings, the excitement went down a little. Let me explain.

Ahsoka making her live action debut is certainly nothing to scoff at. And seeing that she‚Äôll be played by Rosario Dawson like so many fans have wanted is good to see, but that doesn‚Äôt immediately mean she‚Äôll end up being good in the role. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs a bad actress or anything, it‚Äôs just with such high expectations going in, there may end up being something fans find a bit off and not be please by it. And chances are, she might not have even seen Clone Wars or Rebels before being cast in the role. So, if you are exited, at least take it with a grain of salt.

Temeura Morrison return to play Rex and Boba Fett is a logical step, that I‚Äôll start by saying. After all, he did portray Jango fett and his clones in the films and voiced Boba Fett in the special editions of ESB, but it wasn‚Äôt much in my opinion. Jango was never anything special in terms of the movies, just a more of a badass henchmen. All the clones were bland, one dimensional and not nearly as fleshed out as they would be in CW. So, given that, I‚Äôm not sure how well he‚Äôll be able to play Rex and Boba and not make them seem more like the same character. Which leads me to my next point. In ESB, Tem wasn‚Äôt really given enough to work with to justify in my eyes that he is Boba Fett. After all, he only had 4 lines in not just that movie but the entirety of the OT (excluding his scream in ROTJ). So, I‚Äôll have to see how big of a role both characters will have in the series.

And now for my least anticipated character return, Bo Katan. Now, I personally don‚Äôt get how or why this character is so special now. In the clone wars (excluding S7), all she really did was just fight and scowl a lot. Her character didn‚Äôt even have a lot of room to develop. The only thing ever did know was she was a part of Deathwatch, was Satine‚Äôs sister and pretty much has a permanent scowl. It was only when rebels came around that she all of a sudden became so important. And that was only through events we hadn‚Äôt yet seen at that point. And sure season 7, sort of justified her important, but to me it wasn‚Äôt enough. Maybe someone can justify why in the comments if ya don‚Äôt agree.

So, overall all, I‚Äôm at least cautiously optimistic. I‚Äôm still looking forward to seeing how the story will be continued and seeing certain characters return, I‚Äôm still afraid it would end up being fan servicey.

STAR WARS SQUADRONS

This is was the one that mainly prompted my to write a post like this. Am I excited to a game like this, sure. But I can‚Äôt help but be cautious. I mean, this is a $40 multiplayer game with a single player campaign and no micro transactions. If you told me EA would release a game like this in 2020, let alone a Star Wars game like this, is probably say you were high. Cause given this, i can‚Äôt help but think it‚Äôs too good to be true. I mean if this is going to be sold for only $40, then chances are EA don‚Äôt consider on the same level as other higher profile games like Jedi Fallen order or the Battlefront games. So, while the news about I mentioned does sound good, there may be something we haven‚Äôt heard yet that people aren‚Äôt gonna like.

In conclusion, while I am indeed excited for these upcoming projects, I‚Äôve been burned enough before to know that I should take even the most promising of news about upcoming projects with a grain of salt.

I don‚Äôt know about you guys, but I sure as hell gave no shits about the clones in the Star Wars movies. They were souless, replaceable, and they were just a disposable CGI army and I absolutely had no connection to them. Which is why it didn‚Äôt mean much when Palpatine executed Order 66. 

But then I watched The Clone Wars, and this show gave them life, and personality, and relatability, and we all connected with them. Now the order 66 scene is a *very* different scene. 

If you didn‚Äôt like the bad batch, just give them some time to be properly developed over a long format and fleshed out characters.

Ben climbs up to find Rey. I assume she is supposed to be dead at this point, because she‚Äôs lying still and not moving, although maybe she‚Äôs just gravely injures from reflecting Palpatine‚Äôs attack. Anyway, once he finds her he holds her and uses the force to heal her as she did for him earlier in the movie. So he gives his life force to her and basically resurrects her, and they have the kiss. But then Ben starts to lose strength and fall over, because as I believe is said earlier in the movie, you must give up your own life essence to heal someone with the force. So Ben instead starts to die, with Rey looking worried. It is at this point I start to have questions. Once Rey feels Ben dying, what prevents her from using her life force to save him? Why can they not go back and forth healing each other with their life essence? And I guess the answer to that is Ben disappears and becomes one with the force, but then why is that? Why does Ben disappear and presumably become part of the force but Rey‚Äôs body did not earlier? I thought you had to be trained in order to do this like Yoda says to Obi Wan at the end of Episode 3, am I mistaken? And I don‚Äôt understand how Ben knew how to use force heal, is it because of the dyad connection mentioned earlier? They did not go into detail but I guess that means that anything one of them learns, the other does as well?

I'm 28 and that maybe one if the reasons for my issues. But because of the great starwars content coming out recently, aka The Mandalorian, Fallen Order,  the final update to Sw Battlefront 2 and the hype of S7 of TCW, it finally pushed me enough to watch The Clone Wars animated series.

Series 1 was a real struggle, it felt nothing more than a cringey starwars themed kids show and I forced myself through to the end of season 3, yet to start S4. There were a few entertaining episodes, but nothing has wowed me like this subreddit has lead me to believe.

What am I missing? Has anyone else had this feeling and does the show get better from S4 in any discernable way? Am I just too old to appreciate it.

36,I have some concerns for The Bad Batch animated show.,1594667425,"Let me preface this post by saying I am an avid Star Wars fan, of both legends and canon content. I love the Original Trilogy, I get enjoyment from the Prequel Trilogy, and I feel for both sides of the Sequel Trilogy debates. I love the Clone Wars, and I don't love Rebels.

My concerns for The Bad Batch show are somewhat simple but are a bit nuanced. 

First of all, I think they will need to put some thought into how they want to build upon these characters. In the clone wars episodes, they are very trope-y and basic character archetypes. There is the big strong guy, the techy nerd hacker, the sadistic anti -social sniper, and the well rounded leader. This is already a questionable starting point because none of these characters are very original. I mean Hunter legitimately looks like Rambo with a blaster rifle. Jokes aside, the writing team will have a lot of work to do to develop them into more dynamic and interesting characters. The original clones had very tiny differences which were fun to look for, since they are all incredibly similar. You can't play off that with the bad batch though. They are inherently very different.

Second, they need to get away from the comfortable position they put themselves while making Rebels. They never took any risks until the last season, and really did less than I believe they were capable of. 

To paraphrase \*The Cosmonaut Variety Hour\* ""The Clone Wars  was at it's best on the verge of cancellation, it shouldn't be easy to write a fantasy space opera."" 

They essentially made a show for kids, but included things that older fans wanted to see. Which made people disappointed when great characters were dumbed down for this show. Maul and Ahsoka being the obvious ones, but Thrawn being another one. I'd rather they find a medium like clone wars, where it isn't too complex for kids to understand, but it isn't too dumb for adults to enjoy. 

Third, they need to get creative. I touched upon this, but Rebels was incredibly repetitive. If they want people to enjoy this show they are going to need to make episodes worth watching. I understand there needs to be some filler, but there also needs to be plenty that keeps the show interesting. The Mandalorian used lots of suspense and methodical dialogue that kept the episodes interesting and original. 

Another small thing, is that I want them to make fight scenes less static. It seems like in rebels and in a few clone wars episodes, people just slowly walk around while the camera pans to the side. There are no interesting angles, and characters just strafe around, somehow dodging every blaster bolt. Put some people in interesting cover, make the enemies feel smart and have them get behind the heroes once in a while. 

Lastly, I really hope this show doesn't devolve into ""Let's witness the evil of the empire and decide to fight against them!"" I am SO SICK of everything turning into this boring plotline. Rebels, EA's Star Wars Battlefront 2, The Force Unleashed, the sequels, countless novels/comics. Look, I understand that this is the original passion of the star wars universe -- fighting evil. So much more can be done with evil though. Some of the best episodes of The Clone Wars were the pirate episodes where the antagonist isn't the same old droids, but rather they are interesting and funny neutral-evil characters. Another example is the Umbaran arc, where the republic is fighting against a people who want independence. Let's get some creative antagonists. I mean in The Mandalorian, the antagonists for an episode are JAWAS, and IT'S GREAT. 

I love Star Wars and they have made so much great content over the years. I think this show has a really cool premise, but they need to capitalize on it. It could be great.",StarWars,CaptOrdinary,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hqlmmp/i_have_some_concerns_for_the_bad_batch_animated/

*In here, Rey is Luke's Padawan and been training her whole life. She is 16 and also uses a double-bladed yellow lightsaber*

Rey was grown to be the best in everything. And her behaviour represents it.

She is rude and arrogant teenager, who is aware of her power and dark nature. She likes to show her powers around, and basically saying: ""I'm better than you!"" She also seems thick-skinned, because despite the fact that other padawans fear her, she isn't influenced by this. In fact, she is not afraid to bully back when someone bullies her.

But also, she is a very difficult character, with flaws sticking everywhere out of her - she wants her power to be recognised, and always wants more. She has teenager problems - her friend Ben Skywalker-Solo is in love with her and Rey deep down loves him too, but she is too clueless and proud to accept his feelings.

Rey also doesn't like to be protected - like when she wants to be able to go on missions herself, not with the help of her Master - Luke.

For her whole life, she believed that she is a Chosen One, but she isn't. In fact, she is just a powerful nobody.

She also struggles with anger and sometimes can't control her emotions. Her fighting style is even deeply influenced by her emotional state. Usually, she uses her anger and it greatly benefits her.

22,What happened to Rise of Skywalker resembles what happened to Batman v Superman.,1594657962,"I watched some YouTube vids by Doomcock and Midnight's Edge about the troubled production of *Rise of Skywalker* and how Disney is contemplating retconning the sequel trilogy out of the canon through time travel shenanigans.  They say that the production was an awful experience.  Disney panicked after the fans complained about *The Last Jedi* and ordered reshoots which were still being done a month before release.

It feels like a repeat of what happened to the *Justice League* movie.  *Batman v Superman* was such a fundamental disappointment that Warner Bros. decided to ""correct course"" when *Justice League* was still in production, which is how we got this Frankenstein movie that tries to be grim and cheery at the same time.  Perversely, I think *Justice League* is actually better than *Batman v Superman*.  BvS was so terrible that WB's reaction was understandable.

In both these cases, it's the fault of the execs choosing a bad director.  Zack Snyder was never fit to handle superhero movies.  The only good movie he ever made was *300*.  *Sucker Punch* was terrible and *Watchmen* was mediocre.  Likewise, Kathleen Kennedy didn't know how to handle Star Wars.

The reason the Marvel Cinematic Universe worked so well is that they had Kevin Feige.  Additionally, the MCU was built out of B- and C-list superheroes that Marvel couldn't sell during its bankruptcy era, which means they weren't creatively burdened by the memory of previous adaptations.  The reason the Spider-Man movies starring Andrew Garfield were mediocre was because they were dealing with the memory of the Raimi movies.  *Man of Steel* and *Batman v Superman* were filling the shoes of the 1978 Superman movie and the Nolan Batman films.  JJ Abrams thought that rehashing the plot of *A New Hope* was a good way to orient the spirit of the sequel trilogy, then for some weird reason Rian Johnson decided to piss on all that ‚Äî I bet both directors did that out of a feeling of insecurity.

Kevin Feige deserves more praise than he gets.  We don't give management enough credit when they do the job right.  Directors get too much limelight.

45,Would Anakin have fallen to the Dark Side if he had been trained and supported by Qui-Gon Jinn?,1594655867,"Something that has always been a question in my mind is if Anakin's downfall to the Dark Side could have been prevented had he gotten better support from the Jedi and his master?

This is not meant to bash Obi-Wan, but he was ill-suited to train someone like Anakin.  Not only was he recently promoted when he got the job, but he was a firm believer in following the Jedi Order and their dogma.

This led to frequent clashes between Anakin and Obi-Wan, and while the two were close friends, it was clear Anakin often saw himself as superior and felt Obi-Wan held him back.

Making matters worse was the fact that many Jedi such as Mace Windu did not trust Anakin and openly showed their feelings.  Others like Yoda were more understanding but offered misguided advice that drove Anakin away.

Of course, we all know what happened.  Anakin found his support in Palpatine who gradually manipulated him and turned him against the Jedi until finally pushing him to the dark side as Darth Vader.

But let's suppose Qui-Gon survived his duel with Darth Maul and trained Anakin himself.  Could Qui-Gon have prevented Anakin's downfall?

I think he could have provided Anakin with the support that he needed.   Qui-Gon was a well-known maverick among the Jedi and would openly defy the council if he felt it was right.   

Qui-Gon would have understood Anakin's special nature, and done more to help him out.   Qui-Gon also would have better understood some of Anakin's issues and might have given him support, preventing Anakin from turning to Palpatine which led to the downfall of Anakin and the Jedi Order.

So, what does everyone think?  If Qui-Gon had been alive to train Anakin could he have prevented his fall to the Dark Side?

83,How i wanted Ashoka vs Vader to end.,1594647890,"So I‚Äôve been thinking about posting an alternative ending to the season 2 finale of Rebels. It saddened me to think that Vader didn‚Äôt care about his apprentice, yes he lost everything. But Ashoka meant so much to him.

So here is were I‚Äôm going to start.

‚ÄúAshoka!‚Äù Ezra yelled, he needed her to get out of this temple and fast!

Vader‚Äôs eye widened, did he just hear that correctly? He had to make sure he did hear what he thought he heard.

Ashoka was about to get up to leave but someone called out to her.

‚ÄúAshoka‚Äù The Sith Lord called out.

Ashoka felt shock through her body, she slowly turned around.

Vader looked up, the hole in his mask revealing the face of former Jedi Knight: Anakin Skywalker, hero of the Clone Wars.

‚ÄúAnakin...‚Äù Ashoka looked at him feeling heartbroken.

She carried on. ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt leave you! Not this time...‚Äù 

Vader stood up and looked at her menacingly.

They both stared at each other.

‚ÄúThen you will die...‚Äù Vader said as he ignited his lightsaber once more.

‚ÄúAshoka! Nooo!‚Äù Ezra moved quickly to retrieve Ashoka, but she force pushed him away.

Vader made a swift attack from behind causing Ashoka to defend herself.

Vader used all of his brute strength, Ashoka remembering him always using Form 5 during training.

Ashoka defend herself, instead of attacking her former master.

The temple closed down, it was about to self destruct.

Vader used the dark side of the force to attack aggressively, his Sith eye telling his apprentice that Anakin was gone. She was facing Darth Vader. 

Vader looked at ground which was slowly falling to pieces.

Ashoka hugged Vader tightly, tearing up as she did.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry for everything master.... I shouldn‚Äôt have left the order, you wouldn‚Äôt have turned to the dark side...‚Äù She looked up at his eye.

Vader didn‚Äôt move a muscle, he looked down at her with a tear in his eye.

He gripped his lightsaber tightly and dropped it.

The temple had blew up...

A few hours later:

Vader walked out of the temple carrying Ashoka along with him.

She woke up, and looked at her master.

‚ÄúThere is still good in you Anakin.‚Äù She said

‚ÄúThat name, no longer has any meaning for me.‚Äù 

Vader put Ashoka down, and looked at his Tie Fighter. 

He walked up to the Fighter as the entrance slowly opened. 

‚ÄúAnakin...‚Äù Ashoka looked at him.

Vader turned around, his eye still Sith yellow.

‚ÄúMay the force be with you‚Äù Ashoka said confidently.

Vader turned back around and entered the Tie Fighter.

Ashoka looked at the Tie Fighter as it flew away, tears falling down her face.

‚ÄúGoodbye master...‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou will come back.... i know you will...‚Äù

88,"A missed opportunity: if Kylo Ren‚Äôs ""turn"" happens during his confrontation with luke on Crait, it fixes rise of Skywalker's biggest flaws",1594644689,"And here we go‚Ä¶


I am going to admit something; I like Kylo Ren. I like his idolization of Vader, and I especially love the fact that he is trying to find his way in the world overshadowed by a family of heroes. It makes for a fantastic story, but unfortunately, Disney missed an opportunity with him. An opportunity not for Kylo to be redeemed but for him to atone for his atrocities. This works within the current framework of the movie already. It just takes one simple change.

Kylo should have turned to the light side during the confrontation with luke on Crait.

Thematically and narratively, it makes more sense. Kylo and luke come full circle. Luke gets redemption, and Kylo can forgive. The strength needed to force project Luke to Crait still ultimately kills Luke, but we get closure for these two characters. Luke‚Äùs sacrifice would be the spark and Kylo, the fire that lights the resistance.
Kylo could cause the distraction that leads to the resistance getting away. Rey still opens the path and saves them.¬† Kylo would have saved his mother, Leia. The story arc for everyone else is unchanged.¬† But these changes compound, and though they ultimately end in the same place, the meaning is more powerful.¬†

In the rise of Skywalker, we would see slight but meaningful changes from this.¬† instead of MacGuffin hunting, Rey could be on a mission to unite the galaxy against the risen Emporer while Kylo would be free to hunt for the Wayfinder. Kylo would act be the protector, clearing the way for Rey. He would still fight Rey on Endor‚Äôs moon, but the context would be different. Rey would be attacking him, believing that Kylo killed Luke. Leia would force intervene to save Kylo because she knows he still has a part to play.

¬†One of the plot points that would pay dividends would be the knights of Ren storyline. Have Kylo hunting the knights as the knights hunt Rey. He could be the hero in the shadows. Like Cassian, he could be the man that, because of his guilt, could do the unsavory deeds that need to be done. We would see Kylo defeat the Knights to protect Rey.in this version, Kylo would never be Ben solo again, he has gone too far. He can‚Äôt change the past,¬† But he can still help those who have a future.¬†
‚Äò
In the end, Rey and Kylo are still¬† connected by the dyad, and Kylo would still die as a sacrifice for Rey, but his atonement(not redemption) is¬† earned. It does not make up for the pain and suffering he caused but it is not about him; it is about Rey and the galaxy after him.¬† Instead of a last-minute switch to the light,¬† we would see him as a man who recognizes the error of his ways and sets out to make it right. He knows he is past redemption, but he, like Vader, ultimately chooses the light.

¬†Then¬† he would¬† be a true skywalker, a flawed man who sacrifices himself for those he loves",StarWars,TheMediocreCritic,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hqep3r/a_missed_opportunity_if_kylo_rens_turn_happens/
89,"Why we need a Solo 2: To make Han‚Äôs redemption in Empire matter, we have to see Han at his worst.",1594644330,"And here we go‚Ä¶

Like most people, I was underwhelmed by 2018‚Äôs Solo: a Star Wars story. But try as I may, I was never able to figure out precisely why. It has incredible set pieces. I even like Alden Ehrenreich as Han. But the problem became obvious after watching the original trilogy.

*Han in Solo is too good.*

Han is the good guy in Solo. He fights for the little guy, well giant hairy guy. He dumps the wildly profitable Coaxium to save people he only just met. He even helps fund the rebellion at the end of the film. He is, quite simply, a hero. But that‚Äôs not the Han we meet later. The Han we meet later turns into a hero. It doesn‚Äôt work if he was a hero all along. We meet a morally grey Han in ANH, a brash, selfish flyboy who is only concerned with making bucks and giving no f‚Ä¶ cares. So how do we get from the heroic Han in Solo to the jaded Han in a New hope?

*Solo 2 has to be darker. A film that starts as a fun heist that spirals into a life-changing experience for Han. He must be faced with a moral test that he fails. A failure that cannot be undone. The story has to have Stakes. Not just for the fate of the galaxy but also for the fate of our lovable rogue. This film would cement how important his change in ESB really is.* 

Well, so how is that done?. Han has to lose, and not just a little, everything.  We need to see the betrayals and the bad decisions that hurt those he loves, and leaves him jaded, mistrustful, and broken. He needs to do things that are out of character for him. Solo ends with Han going to take a job from Jabba the hut. This job will go south, not just in a financial way, we already know that,  but in a way that makes Han betray his own code of ethics. His ideals. It will be because of these personal betrayals that Han will be a different man at the end of Solo 2. That would set up the man we meet in ANH. 

Han‚Äôs change of heart in The Empire strikes back has an emotional impact because we see the difference in him. He starts scared to open up to others. His whole life has been one betrayal and heartbreak after another. The gruff Nerfherder exterior is a coping mechanism. But then he meets the Skywalkers. He decides against his better judgment to help the people he loves not because it is profitable, but because it is the right thing to do. He is man who has found something worth fighting for. He finds people to care about, a  tribe and a family. And because of that, he becomes what he always was, a hero. 

So in closing.

**Han needs to be lost to be found.** 

What do you think? Under the right direction, could Solo 2 be great?

Looking for my next book suggestions,1594640870,"I've recently started reading some Star Wars novels (a mix of Legends and Canon) and it's been really enjoyable so far. I know there are a lot of books out there which aren't too great so I was wondering, what books are your favourite and why?

So far I've read the following, not reading things in any particular order, just whatever I fancy:

**Shadows of the Empire -** really enjoyed this! It's great having a story that falls between TESB and ROTJ, I wish there were more.

**Thrawn** \- I thought it was a great introduction to his character having only seen him in Rebels. Are the next two new Thrawn books any good? I plan on reading Zahn's Thrawn Trilogy at some point.

**Catalyst** \- I thought this was ok, it got a little boring. Has anyone read **Rebel Rising**? That sounds interesting as I absolutely love Rogue One.

**Lost Stars** \- Although a YA novel I absolutely loved this! I found it a real page turner and got really invested in the characters.

Just started reading **Master and Apprentice** and I have **Kenobi** and **Ahsoka** to read after. Where should I go next (p.s. I'm not overly interested in stories linking to the sequel trilogy but will if they are recommended)?

1,"Unpopular opinion: The First Order was as good as, if not better, than the Empire, at least in the movies.",1594633773,"I've been on a marathon and noticed this.

Now for the First Order. They quietly rose from the ashes of the Empire and obliterated a system with the New Repiblic Fleet. Starkiller probably wouldn't have fallen if not for Solo infiltrating the base. In TLJ, they had the Resistance completely wiped if not for a lucky hole in the back of a cave. Then over the next year they brought the galaxy to submission, only losing because of the Jedi vs Sith thing, and having the entire galaxy rise against them vs just a Rebellion. They did all of this with a fraction of the force that the Empire had. Of course, this isnt to say the Empire isnt badass, and I'm mostly considering movie material.

6,What I think the ‚Äúultimate‚Äù Star Wars game would look like,1594625123,"Now, of course there are tons of game ideas out there, but I felt like I had to share my concept of it.

Several of my ideas have been heavily infuelced by other games i‚Äôve played, which will be mentioned along with the original idea and how i believe it could be implemented.

‚Ä¢A Jedi‚Äôs Full Path and Conflict‚Ä¢

So, I believe the game should follow the story and development of a youngling, later a jedi padawan (the classic star wars story), see them becoming a knight, fighting for the order, eventually becoming a member of the council, training future jedi, getting a padawan assigned to them. The entire arc of a jedi.

I will not give too much specificity and thus restriction to the story itself, but i believe it could revolve around the inner conflict of having been taken from their family as a child and realizing, that becoming a jedi was never actually a decision, eventually having that decision featured in the game (maybe the ending) of whether to stay with the order or leave it to live a life of their own.

‚Ä¢Multiple Dialogue Options‚Ä¢

The storytelling would be in the style of how the story of the Mass Effect trilogy was told, almost always featuring custom dialogue options and decisions, with some having story-changing significance, but most of them simply having the (in my opinion crucial) role of developing and customizing your player‚Äôs character and personality. 

‚Ä¢Character Customization‚Ä¢

And with that convenient segue, I believe the game should feature a fully customizable character including height, weight, garments, and as the gem that Jedi: Fallen Order gave us, lightsaber customization (which would be a prominent element of the story when our character reaches the age when they can make their own lightsaber). All of these are very important in my opinion for getting the full experience and personalization of the story...and are also really cool.

‚Ä¢Limited Open-World‚Ä¢

Something that both Jedi: Fallen Order and Mass Effect did really well is choosing the right balance of limited levels to open world. When you‚Äôre in a mission, you want to be focused on that, but you‚Äôd also like to walk around and interact with the world while out of missions. Full open world (like the one SWTOR uses) in my experience could make the story too drawn out.

‚Ä¢Customizable Fighting Animations‚Ä¢

So, the idea would look something like a mixture of Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy‚Äôs and Jedi: Fallen Order‚Äôs fighting mechanics, and the animation selection of NBA 2k, where you can select which animation your character should use for each certain action (such as dribble moves, layups, jump shots, dunks, so basically there are several options for every movement a player might make). The way this could be implemented for lightsaber (or even force) combat is that there would be a certain number of different animations for one specific move. For each contoller command that would mean a specific kind of move, you could choose to equip a more elegant or agressive or acrobatic animation, or maybe even ones differentiated by which lightsaber form that move belongs to.

‚Ä¢Developing Force Usage Style as a Padawan‚Ä¢

During certain stages of learning, they would make decisions which force power to focus on. For example, in ‚Äúclass‚Äù, you‚Äôd have the option to either delve deeper into learning the jedi mind trick or to push and pull larger objects or so. Later on this same mechanic could mean that as a teenager they could decide to further their understanding of the force or focus on lightsaber combat. This would function as an ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù skill tree where your development of your powers happens during and in the story.

‚Ä¢Staged in the Era of a Flourishing Republic‚Ä¢

The game would have to be set in the time of either the prequels republic (maybe before the clone wars) or the rise of the new republic as it would be set in the time of a stable jedi order, which has either Yoda or Luke as the grandmaster. This would be important since the game would focus on the internal, personal conflict of a jedi, rather than the absolution of galactic chaos and war.

‚Ä¢Summary (TL;DR)‚Ä¢

To summarize, it would be a game with personalized combat mechanics and fully customizable character creation, about the (to an extent) choice-based story of a Jedi‚Äôs life, its development, the responsibility, the struggle, and the realization that whatever a person may be born into, the decision of what to live in is inevitable and fundamental to every person‚Äôs life.

11,Just played and Platinumed Force Unleashed 1 and 2...,1594622227,"So this was my first time playing them on PS3 (through PS Now), when I was younger I only played the Wii versions of both games (but I barely remember my experiences with those).  Just wanted to share my thoughts on the experience.

First game: To say I had a ""fun time"" would be a straight up lie.  The gameplay here does not hold up.  There were way too many times where I messed up, but I know it wasn't my fault.  Tiny rooms with Dark Troopers and Evo Troopers and clunky controls made me want to rage quit.  Fortunately it got better with time, and by the time I reached Imperial Felucia, I was getting used to the controls and input.

Now for positives.  The level design and variety is awesome, really feels like your on this grand quest for redemption.  Enemies had cool designs, none were TOO repetitive.  

The story is awesome, the characters were likable; (I really think you can bring the core idea of Vader having a secret apprentice into canon, you just have to remove the whole ""start a rebellion thing"", because we already have a canonical reason for that.  Maybe bring in Galen as a secret Inquisitor?)

Let's see what else... DLC is a really cool ""What If?"" scenario, and the fight with Darth Maul caught me way off guard, I actually screamed.

Second game: This one... Isn't bad.  So before I went into the game, I did some research, and apparently Lucasarts only took 9 MONTHS to make this.  That explains a whole lot.  Wow is this game short.  I clocked the first game around 7 hours my first playthrough.  This was about 4.5.  

I thought the levels were cool, but they were super repetitive.  And there's only 3 true areas, Kamino, Kato Neimoidia, and The Salvation.  Dagobah doesn't count, because you literally walk a few feet and BOOM, cutscene and your on to the Salvation.  Some areas felt very samey, hallways that looked the same, and gameplay elements that were VERY repetitive, like the skydiving sequences, and the quick time events.  

While those aspects of the gameplay are a negative, a positive is that Galen feels way better to play as on this one than one.  He was so clunky in the first, and in this it felt so smooth.  Double bladed sabers are a cool bonus, and the force powers actually felt more powerful, and packed a punch.  Also this game is gorgeous; for a game from 2011, it honestly wouldn't need that much of an upgrade if it were ported.

The story... Well the idea for it is cool.  I just wish we got 4 more hours of it.  Plus the characters were just not like last time.  Galen was fine, he's a clone struggling to deal with that fact, it's a nice personal struggle, and I like how he says he's free of Vader at the end.  However Juno and Proxy are barely in this, they have like 15 lines combined.  Kota... I like his character, but the VO did a poor job with some of the line delivery, kinda felt like he just went in to record, did it all in one take, and collected a paycheck.

So after playing both games back to back, I guess I can say that Force Unleashed 1 has a great story, but clunky gameplay, and Force Unleashed 2 has great gameplay with an average story.  If I had to go back to one, I honestly would do 2, mainly because I know I'm going to have fun with it and not want to throw my remote at the TV. 

Just wanted to share my thoughts on this really cool series.",StarWars,Jose__Manuel,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hqacy5/just_played_and_platinumed_force_unleashed_1_and_2/
12,Luke Skywalker is horrible in the new Star Wars movies.,1594621989," Star Wars is one of the greatest movie franchises of all time. Ever since A New Hope was released to theaters, we fell in love. The original trilogy was crafted masterfully. The writing was pure genius, the music was beautifully composed by the legend John Williams, and the set and costume designs were ahead of their time. And the performances were captivating, as every character was portrayed and mastered to perfection. But, with the release of the newest movies, Star Wars has lost its magic and charm. The people who worked on these films have lost their integrity, selling out to the likes of Disney. It seems to just be a cash grab nowadays. The thing that makes Star Wars what it is has been lost. Admittedly, The Force Awakens wasn't horrible. JJ Abrams, the director of this movie, had a full arch planned for each character, staying loyal to the formula of storytelling. But when Abrams decided to quit his work on The Last Jedi, Rian Johnson took his position, Abrams basically told him to do whatever he wanted. Johnson then decided to throw out the entire script and all of the ideas Abrams had a start from scratch, which is the absolute worst thing one could do for a trilogy. At that point, everything that Abrams had built up for the characters was gone, and the new movie would make no sense from then on, and that's exactly what happened.  The second you see Luke Skywalker throw a light saber off of a cliff for no reason at all, you should realize that something is wrong. In the original trilogy, Luke's primary character trait was hope and optimism. He was so hopeful, that he even tried to help Darth Vader change his evil ways because he knew he had some good within him. In The Last Jedi, however, Luke is a bitter old man who resents his past and doesn't care about anything or anyone. The Luke I know and love would never behave like that, as it represents everything that he isn't. Star Wars has lost the emotion and wonder that it was previously known for. I hope the new movie is good.

From what I‚Äôve read, it‚Äôs going to take place 8 years after Revenge of the Sith, and *APPARENTLY* Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman may be making a return. I can‚Äôt really think of Obi Wan doing something badass shit during that time frame as his main goal was to lay low and out of the empires sight. However, I do have a few predictions of things we might see

- Fight with an inquisitor. 
To my knowledge, inquisitors are a fairly new concept introduced in Rebels. An encounter with an inquisitor who threatens to report his location to Vader would make for an interesting fight.

- Interactions with Ashoka Tano
With the Mandalaroin season 2 coming up and having an actual Ashoka (not the animated one we‚Äôre used to seeing) could lead to interactions between the two.

- Learning how to become a force ghost from Qui Gon (obvious)
This one goes without saying as we‚Äôre all kinda expecting this. Would definitely shed some light on the whole force ghost thing

- Interactions with a young Luke
This could be very interesting because we haven‚Äôt seen Luke other than him as an old man/young adult/newborn. It‚Äôs common knowledge Obi Wan watched over Luke, and 8 years after ROTS sets up perfectly for a young Luke to make an appearance. Like the fan flick on YouTube, possibly saving young Luke from the Empire?

- Flashbacks with Anakin and maybe Padme
If the rumors of their return are true, it could definitely set up a flash back with the two. Possibly training, clone wars battles, and maybe even Obi Wan walking in on Anakin and Padme and catching wind of their relationship, basically confirming his suspicions

- Duel with Vader (BOLD OPINION)
This one is far fetched because it would take away the duel on the Death Star being their first encounter since Mustafar. However, it wouldn‚Äôt not make sense. In the episode 4, Vader says ‚Äúa presence I have not felt since...‚Äù and then during their fight says ‚Äúyou should not have comeback‚Äù. Although George Lucas did not envision a stand-alone tv series for Obi Wan 30+ years later, the quote ‚Äúyou should not have comeback‚Äù could easily set up a fight between the two that occurred after ROTS and before the Death Star. Possibly Obi Wan goes hunting for Vader out of guilt, and they briefly duel ending a tie. I know the quote ‚Äúwhen I left you I was but the learner now I am the master‚Äù may foil this already very bold prediction, however if it‚Äôs only 8 years after Vader became Palpatines apprentice, he‚Äôs still technically the learner and has a whole other decade and some extra till the duel on the Death Star where he really is the master. 

I know the last one was bold but I‚Äôm just brainstorming here. None of this could happen and we could just get a few hours of watching a depressed Obi Wan walking through the desert.",StarWars,steelhustlin,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hq94jm/obi_wan_series_predictions/

Their Avengers films are straight Science fiction films Infinity war is a war movie on a cosmic scale and Endgame is time travel heist film they all feel like they belong in that universe but the DNA and storytelling approach are very different.

Refugee: ""I saw what you did to those exchange thugs, stranger. Can you spare a few credits, maybe help another refugee in need?""

Meetra Surik (The Exile): ""Of course. Here's five credits."" Refugee: ""Thank you stranger, - I won't forget your kindness.""

(Refugee exits)

Kreia: ""Why would you do such a thing? Such kindness will mean nothing, his path is set. Giving him what he has not earned is like pouring sand into his hands.

Meetra Surik: ""It may help him - if nothing else but to survive. As long as there is hope, there is the chance for redemption every day.""

Kreia: ""And would that be a kindness? What if by surviving another day, he brings a greater darkness upon another?""

Meetra Surik: ""You cannot know that.""

Kreia: ""The Force binds all things. The slightest push, the smallest touch, sends echoes throughout life. Even an act of kindness may have more sever repercussions than you know or can see. By giving him something he has not earned, perhaps all you have helped him become is a target.""

(Through the force, Kreia and Surik watch the refugee as he is mugged by another refugee)

Kreia: ""Seeing another elevated often brings the eyes of others who suffer. And perhaps in the end, all you have wrought is more pain. And that is my lesson to you. Be careful of charity and kindness, lest you do more harm with open hands than with a clenched fist.""

Meetra Surik: ""There is wisdom in what you say. Perhaps I will not be so quick to offer aid in the future.""

Kreia: ""Good. Mind what I have said. Use your power, but in its proper place.""

.

This is one of the best scenes in the entirety of the Star Wars Universe. This shows you the true colors of Kreia's character. She does not stick to the concepts of light and dark. She realizes that morality, and the force, are both spectrums. She is able to show you that the right thing isn't always the right thing to do. Most people cite this lesson to as her being sith, but I despise this viewpoint. To look at it in such a way is to be close minded, and to disgrace the entirety of Kreia's brilliant character. Kreia is the penultimate example of the grey jedi. She casts aside titles such as good and evil and asks the deeper questions. She wanted Meetra Surik to follow in these footsteps, just as Revan did, but ultimately Surik chose not to. Kreia hated the force. She hated the concept of light and dark. She saw them not as they were, but rather as two halves of a bigger whole.To not accept either teaching was foolish, and weak. Kreia was able to look at the Force as it truly was, making her one of the most well written characters in Star Wars history.",StarWars,KensukeTanabe,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hq87zl/why_kreia_is_the_most_well_written_character_in/

24,I think we the fandom are making a mistake in assuming that just because people didn't believe the Jedi existed in the ST/OT that the galaxy didn't believe the Jedi existed during the Old Republic or PT era,1594608331,"I think that the fandom has made a mistake in assuming that the Galaxy at large didn't know the Jedi Order existed or didn't believe they existed. 

Basically what I think is happening is that people are taking that 10,000 Jedi number and the way the Jedi are known, or rather unkown, in the OT and ST era's and thinking that means that the Jedi were unkown in say the PT era or in the old republic. 

So first off I'm talking about the PT era and further in the past. NOT the OT and ST eras. This isn't about how much the Empire would have to white wash history or stuff like that this is about the galaxy at the time of the Jedi Order still being around. 

So while that whole ""Well their are so few jedi most people never met them in person"" argument works a bit for explaining how people could start to think that the Order was made up or charlatans or just made up et all as Republic propaganda it doesn't really work during the PT and pre PT era. 

For example it would be hard but possible to teach the Mandolorian Wars without mentioning the Jedi (if you attribuite all the Jedi and Revan did to the Republic) but you can't do that with the Great Sith War, or the New Sith Wars (Jedi-Sith War) and the NSW invovled the sacking of Coruscant and the formation of the Galatic Republic. Not to mention all of the other wars that popped up with jedi involvement. So even if you never met a jedi personally they are a intrinsic part of Galatic history and would at least show up in history books and movies and books and on and on. 

But the Jedi weren't just a part of the past during those times. They were a active force in the Galaxy. Even if people didn't know of believe that the Jedi used the force they would still at least have a idea that they were in some way connected to the Republic. 

In Master and Apprentiece you have people know that the Jedi are in charge of the Kyber trade and know how Jedi deal with pirates. You have normal people making comments about how people think Jedi are meant to act. 

In Jedi Lost we have Jedi at a major race and it being televised. We learn that its seen as a thing of pride for a planet, and the family, to have a child that joins the Jedi order. 

And in High Republic the Jedi are central to whats happening in all sectors of the story. They are the ones helping map new hyperspace lanes, the ones working with colonists at places like the lighthouse, dealing with the Great Disaster. While people would never physically meet a Jedi they know that they are around and part of the Republic. Like how we may not be able to name a diplomat but we know our country has a diplomatic corps. 

Jedi are in the news both during the war and before, they are central to the history of the Republic and Galaxy while also being a active part of it. 

So while we can say the fact that most never met the jedi allowed the Empire to play them off as fakes or propaganda I think its a mistake to say that just because people in the OT/ST don't think they exist (which isn't even true as Aphra comics, Doc Ondars shop, and other things all deal with Jedi history and people knowing about it) does not people people always thought the Jedi weren't fake. 

Now I could see people outside the republic maybe not knowing the Jedi exist during the Old Republic or PT era but for those in the Republic it would be like someone not knowing the Red Cross or FBI exist or that the government has a diplomatic corps.

TLDR: Just because most people don't know about the Jedi Order/don't think they existed in the OT/ST era doesn't mean people didn't think they existed when they were active in the galaxy and the books prove that.",StarWars,TheMastersSkywalker,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hq7cw6/i_think_we_the_fandom_are_making_a_mistake_in/

Not to mention Durge and Grievous were reborn as cyborgs to give them the very new reincarnation and freedom to lead the crusade against the tyranny that befell them.

It is human nature that they want to be free and non human including aliens and droids show that they are giving freedom to the beings that they want to fight for.

Even the Rebel Alliance is wrong as they continue to deploy humans, aliens, droids, Jedi, and clones alike to restore the very government that the CIS hated.

Would you have changed anything about it?",1594595207,"Cause I was fine with it. I do agree like many fans Snoke could have been a more awesome villain by not being killed off so suddenly in the Last Jedi with hardly any action or at least return in some way but having Palpatine back for the grand finale felt even better as it made him the big bad of the whole Skywalker Saga. Seeing Snoke was just some puppet character created in a tank with other copies of him (so a clone or something else grown with failed versions I dunno) felt kind of anti-climatic and odd at first as it made him feel more like an object he whole time and not an actual character. But later I felt like it was quite a cool twist on his character. 

If I could change things I would have made him much more interesting by having him as a clone or animated corpse of Darth Plagueis. Seeing Palpatine's master that he killed years before in the movies would be awesome and as a throwback to the old ""tragedy of Darth Plagueis the wise,"" he talks about in Episode III. And to think if he was Plagueis, Kylo would have done to him what the Emperor did years ago. I bet the emperor would say something like this in Episode IX when Kylo says ""I killed Snoke, I'll kill you."" 

""My boy...did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the wise? It happened before...and has happened again...by you...for Snoke was a clone...of Darth Plagueis the wise...""

58,The Sequel Trilogy is Redeemable and We May Still Grow to Love It,1594594701,"Expecting some hate some this, but fuck it lmao I think the sequel trilogy could get better with time like the prequels have. It just depends on how well the side shows are done like TCW and Rebels were.
The fight scenes were fucking sick too!! When the storm troopers were chasing them after that festival(I don‚Äôt remember the planet), that choreography was crazy, and the cinematography was incredible in general. That‚Äôs what a massive Disney budget will get you tho lmao.
Most of the characters‚Äô arcs are redeemable in my opinion. 
The whole First Order rise to power will be difficult to explain, because it‚Äôll be tough to believe given how short the window would have been after Luke‚Äôs disappearance so idk about that one. But like Po and Finns stories still have a lot of potential. We‚Äôve grown to love storm troopers before (shoutout Rex!). The revelation that Finn is force-sensitive makes for a really cool arc. Idk how believable any attempt to explain Rey‚Äôs ridiculous force powers will be, but there could be an arc like Anakin‚Äôs where the Father tested him. That may be trash tho who knows lol. 
While, admittedly, the writing was lazy, I‚Äôll admit that fully lol, most of the arcs set up in the sequels are justifiable depending on how different shows are done. 
TLJ made it tough tho cuz that movie was just straight trash lmaoo also the fact that the entire trilogy takes place within a year just pisses me off. 
I really hope there‚Äôs a clone wars-style animated series with Filoni involved, that would 100% be dope af. I hope the sequels can be saved!! I fuckin love Star Wars so I really hope they make them believable and more enjoyable to watch.

For the past few months, there are been a lot of reaction videos on youtube of people watching Star Wars for the first time. It's fun to see how people react, seeing the movies for the first time.  Most of them already know that Vader is Luke's father, but the usually don't expect it in the second movie.  
- No-one knows that Leia is Luke's sister, so that is a big reveal. And everyone immediately remembers the kiss. üòÇ  
- Seeing Owen and Beru's skeletons is pretty shocking by today's standard, and most reactions are of shock.  
- ""Listen to them, they're dying R2"" is still hilarious.  
- When Han says ""Do you think a princess and a guy like me"" and Luke says ""No"", everyone smiles at that. üòä  
- Another holy shit moment is Luke's hand getting cut off.  Again, that's something we just don't see these days.  
- Most people don'y mind Jar Jar. (I do)  
- Nobody understands or cares what midichlorians are

70,Unpopular Revenge of the sith thought,1594590806,"I think Revenge of the Sith is very overrated by this sub even in relation to the rest of the prequels. To me that movie feels like George Lucas was tired of doing this stuff and just made the most functional movie but there‚Äôs nothing special about it. I think about Phantom Menace and attack or the clone and feel George was very very invested and was trying to do something new and weird and made every single choice with intention and purpose. Like episode 2 going to the cloner planet and showing us the ground level of Courusant is George playing with noir movies he loved and riffing on the aesthic of blade runner. That made a very weird ass movies that understandably a lot of people hated and I understand it. However, in terms of score, visuals and sequences like the pod race I enjoy it way more. The visuals of episode 3 just feel like George said make it like Star Wars to the VFX company and let them do there thing. I feel George was playing around with the story and having fun in 1&amp;2. Revenge of the sith feels like he basically just wanted to get from point A to B and due to the reception and grind just tried to get everything done as simply and less painstaking as possible. Like episode 2 basically ends with the clone wars starting and establishing count doku,,,, and then episode 3 basically starts by ending the clone wars and killing off Doku in the most uninteresting or meaningful way, again just feels like he wanted to tie up those plot threads and not deal with them. I have no problems with messing with expectations but it just seemed like he said: well Anakin has to go dark so let‚Äôs just have him kill count doku to set that up, I guess we‚Äôll show him struggle by him not doing it and then the emperor will tell him to do it. Going to Khashek just feels like someone saying: we need another action sequence here, I guess people like Chewy let‚Äôs show that. Even the ending, it feels like he could‚Äôve been Vader longer which wouldn‚Äôt created a little more tension because you wouldn‚Äôt know what happens next where in RoS the entire time you‚Äôre just waiting for that to happen. Again I think George made a bold/surprising choice in episode 1 starting off with a little kid (perhaps the wrong choice to be fair) it‚Äôs surprising to me he ends with the most obvious possible ending. But idk I feel like that‚Äôs because he just wanted to be done with it and not think about what happens right after. I feel like people are very attracted to this movie because it‚Äôs the most functional/normal movie of the prequels with the least amount of weird stuff going on, but to me that just makes it boring. Does anyone else feel the same way because reading this sub I feel like I‚Äôm on an island lol

With that being said: the space opera scene where Anakin and Palp talk (I mean from a screenwriter view it makes no sense he didn‚Äôt immediately realize that‚Äôs the Sith Lord controlling everything) however that‚Äôs the only time in episode 3 it feels George Lucas is trying to do something weird and out there and working super hard on a small detail in the background that does nothing other than a little world building. I feel there‚Äôs a bunch of that type of stuff in episode 1 &amp; 2 and basically none in episode 3.  Obviously that doesn‚Äôt make it a better movie, but if we‚Äôre being honest I don‚Äôt think any of them are good movies, but I respect the weirdness and boldness of episode 1 &amp; 2.",StarWars,southwoc21,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hq2vgw/unpopular_revenge_of_the_sith_thought/

72,Episode V and VIII,1594590575,"I've just been to watch Empire in the cinema and have never really noticed how much The Last Jedi copies plot points. Not bringing hate to it for doing so however I feel that the similarities between 4 and 7 were really highlighted and brought to the forefront of peoples opinion of the movies.

Similarities:

Openings: Both movies open with the rebel/resistance base being found by the empire/first order causing them to abandon the base.

Training: Both movies have the lightsaber wielder trained in a remote location by a master who is initially very against training them. The training also causes them to be apart from the rest of the group for the majority of the movie.

Dark side temptation: Both Jedi in training are called to by a dark and dreary area of where they're being trained and shown a vision of their greatest fear.

Ships: Both the resistance fleet and the Falcon are unable to make it to lightspeed and are closely followed by the first order/empire for large portions of the film.

Last Jedi - I was really hyped for the movie: I saw the trailers a lot of times and I spent a lot of time reading theories on the Internet. But when I saw the movie, I found it dissapointing: I left the theaters with a sour taste in my mouth.

Rise of Skywalker - I was not hyped for the movie thanks to the last movie but I was hoping it was good. I had mixed about it after I watched: while I had more fun watching it than The Last Jedi, as a end to the trilogy and as a finale the whole Skywalker Saga, I thought it was dissapointing.",StarWars,GenericUserName811,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hq2gdn/my_opinion_on_the_sequel_trilogy/
76,What I think the ‚Äúultimate‚Äù Star Wars game could look like,1594587028,"Now, of course there are tons of game ideas out there, but I felt like I had to share my concept of it.

Several of my ideas have been heavily infuelced by other games i‚Äôve played, which will be mentioned along with the original idea and how i believe it could be implemented.

‚Ä¢A Jedi‚Äôs Full Path and Conflict‚Ä¢

So, I believe the game should follow the story and development of a youngling, later a jedi padawan (the classic star wars story), see them becoming a knight, fighting for the order, eventually becoming a member of the council, training future jedi, getting a padawan assigned to them. The entire arc of a jedi.

I will not give too much specificity and thus restriction to the story itself, but i believe it could revolve around the inner conflict of having been taken from their family as a child and realizing, that becoming a jedi was never actually a decision, eventually having that decision featured in the game (maybe the ending) of whether to stay with the order or leave it to live a life of their own.

‚Ä¢Multiple Dialogue Options‚Ä¢

The storytelling would be in the style of how the story of the Mass Effect trilogy was told, almost always featuring custom dialogue options and decisions, with some having story-changing significance, but most of them simply having the (in my opinion crucial) role of developing and customizing your player‚Äôs character and personality. 

‚Ä¢Character Customization‚Ä¢

And with that convenient segue, I believe the game should feature a fully customizable character including height, weight, garments, and as the gem that Jedi: Fallen Order gave us, lightsaber customization (which would be a prominent element of the story when our character reaches the age when they can make their own lightsaber). All of these are very important in my opinion for getting the full experience and personalization of the story...and are also really cool.

‚Ä¢Limited Open-World‚Ä¢

Something that both Jedi: Fallen Order and Mass Effect did really well is choosing the right balance of limited levels to open world. When you‚Äôre in a mission, you want to be focused on that, but you‚Äôd also like to walk around and interact with the world while out of missions. Full open world (like the one SWTOR uses) in my experience could make the story too drawn out.

‚Ä¢Customizable Fighting Animations‚Ä¢

So, the idea would look something like a mixture of Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy‚Äôs and Jedi: Fallen Order‚Äôs fighting mechanics, and the animation selection of NBA 2k, where you can select which animation your character should use for each certain action (such as dribble moves, layups, jump shots, dunks, so basically there are several options for every movement a player might make). The way this could be implemented for lightsaber (or even force) combat is that there would be a certain number of different animations for one specific move. For each contoller command that would mean a specific kind of move, you could choose to equip a more elegant or agressive or acrobatic animation, or maybe even ones differentiated by which lightsaber form that move belongs to.

‚Ä¢Developing Force Usage Style as a Padawan‚Ä¢

During certain stages of learning, they would make decisions which force power to focus on. For example, in ‚Äúclass‚Äù, you‚Äôd have the option to either delve deeper into learning the jedi mind trick or to push and pull larger objects or so. Later on this same mechanic could mean that as a teenager they could decide to further their understanding of the force or focus on lightsaber combat. This would function as an ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù skill tree where your development of your powers happens during and in the story.

‚Ä¢Staged in the Era of a Flourishing Republic‚Ä¢

The game would have to be set in the time of either the prequels republic (maybe before the clone wars) or the rise of the new republic as it would be set in the time of a stable jedi order, which has either Yoda or Luke as the grandmaster. This would be important since the game would focus on the internal, personal conflict of a jedi, rather than the absolution of galactic chaos and war.

‚Ä¢Summary (TL;DR)‚Ä¢

To summarize, it would be a game with personalized combat mechanics and fully customizable character creation, about the (to an extent) choice-based story of a Jedi‚Äôs life, its development, the responsibility, the struggle, and the realization that whatever a person may be born into, the decision of what to live in is inevitable and fundamental to every person‚Äôs life.

And for Obi-Wan, James Arnold Taylor was an amazing choice because in TCW, he sounded almost the same as Ewan did in the prequels. And in rebels he was able to capture the older Obi-Wan sound really well too.

89,Why Rey is my favourite character and The Last Jedi my favourite Star Wars movie.,1594578685,"The Force Awakens coming to theaters is what finally got me to watch the movies at 17. I watched them in the order of cinematic release, and they were pretty fun. I wasn't surprised when I decided TFA was my favourite; a modern movie for a teenager who enjoys modern movies. I also quickly fell in love with Rey; it was so cool to see this young woman to whom I could relate to an extent be so awesome and kick ass.

By the time TLJ came out, I was living in the absolute worst, darkest period of my very short life. I was sitting alone in that theater, a 19-year-old orphan girl who was living alone in a shitty apartment I could barely afford, and I was watching this *19-year-old orphan girl who was struggling and alone* and she was afraid, and in doubt, and confused, but also so fierce and strong and independent and so incredibly optimistic. It gave me so much joy and hope to see her be so brave, and make meaningful connections in the most unexpected places. I walked out of that theatre happy and overwhelmed in a very positive way. I couldn't stop thinking about the movie for weeks. It made me believe that, even though I didn't have this magical cosmic power like she did, I could still keep kicking, and be okay.

(Unfortunately I can't say that I felt the same after TROS. I was quite saddened to see how they turned her character into someone who was scared of herself, who needed approval from others, who was stripped completely of her own agency, who became a mere vessel; I walked out of the theatre feeling miserable and hopeless.)

Nothing in this world is perfect, and that applies to this character and the movies she's in, as well. I'm aware of that. But I'm also aware of the fact that there are many reasons why some people hold certain things close to their heart, while other things don't sit well with them. As long as it doesn't interfere negatively with your life, why be mean about it?

6,‚ÄúAssassination‚Äù - my Star Wars fan fic chapter. Tell me what you think,1594571959,"Anakin saves Padme. My fan fic chapter

Star Wars: Reverse, Season I, Chapter 12

After hearing this, Anakin felt numb and thought he was going to collapse. *What? Bomb? Padme?!*

Anakin flew out of the office in terror. He needed to save Padme. Get to her office in time. *NOW.*

&amp;#x200B;

‚Äì ‚ÄúOh my Force!‚Äù ‚Äì The Chancellor was terrified. ‚Äì ‚ÄúSet a message to the Jedi Council and alert everyone. I want the Council to send a Jedi to save Senator Amidala!‚Äù

Anakin jumped into his speeder, and without alerting anyone in the Jedi Council, flew at almost light speed to save Padme.

‚Äì ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt lose you my Star‚Äù. ‚Äì Anakin was thinking while riding. ‚Äì ‚ÄúNot today, not ever‚Äù.

Meanwhile, the Chancellor‚Äôs message reached out to the Jedi Council. Everyone was in pure shock.

‚Äì ‚ÄúSenator Amidala is help ours needed‚Äù. ‚Äì Said Master Yoda.

‚Äì ‚ÄúMaster Coleman Kcaj, you go and save the senator‚Äù. ‚Äì Said Mace Windu. ‚Äì ‚ÄúAlso, Obi-Wan ‚Äì have you seen Skywalker?‚Äù

‚Äì ‚ÄúThis is not important now‚Äù. ‚Äì Said Obi-Wan. ‚Äì ‚ÄúOur only focus is Senator Amidala‚Äôs safety‚Äù.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, Anakin reached Padme‚Äôs office, that luckily, wasn‚Äôt exploded. He spotted his wife near the window. She was looking calm ‚Äì she still didn‚Äôt know about the bomb? Hadn‚Äôt the Jedi warned her?

‚Äì ‚ÄúGet away from the window!‚Äù ‚Äì Anakin screamed to Padme. Padme looked terrified, but listened and ran away as far as she could.

Suddenly, Anakin jumped and broke the window. Padme was standing there shocked. After regaining consciousness, Anakin ran to Padme and grabbed her by the hand.

‚Äì ‚ÄúPadme, we need to run ‚Äì there is a bomb in your office!‚Äù ‚Äì Anakin screamed.

Padme was shocked and froze, but immediately snapped out and ran away with Anakin. Anakin‚Äôs plan was to jump in the speeder and fly away, but suddenly, while jumping, they didn‚Äôt reach the speeder and fell down.

Luckily, Anakin grabbed Padme and they both fell with a safety. Suddenly, there was a terrible explosion. Padme and Anakin were laying on the ground, covered in dirt and looking at the office that had just blown up.

&amp;#x200B;

Anakin helped Padme to get up and she started crying almost hysterically. Anakin hugged her and they both let out their shock.

‚Äì ‚ÄúEverything is okay now, my Star‚Äù. ‚Äì Anakin kept sobbing silently. ‚Äì ‚ÄúYou are safe now‚Äù.

When Padme stopped crying, Anakin took her by the hand and they prepared to go to the speeder together.

&amp;#x200B;

Suddenly, Anakin sensed someone. He turned, and in a split second, threw Padme on the ground. A blaster shot was made in a place, where Padme was standing *one second ago*.

Anakin spotted that person, a *bounty hunter*, who tried to fly away.

*Anakin was boiling with rage*. He used the Force and the hunter was slammed to the ground.

The hunter tried to get away, but Anakin lifted him up and started strangling him.

‚Äì ‚ÄúWho sent you?!‚Äù ‚Äì Anakin demanded answers.

‚Äì ‚ÄúThe‚Ä¶ Sith‚Ä¶ Lord‚Äù‚Ä¶  ‚Äì The bounty hunter was gasping for air. ‚Äì ‚ÄúHe‚Ä¶ Wanted‚Ä¶ Me‚Ä¶ To‚Ä¶ Kill‚Ä¶ Her‚Äù...

&amp;#x200B;

Anakin threw him on the ground and immediately slashed him in a half with his lightsaber.

Meanwhile in the OT and PT:

Giant creature can apparently breath/survive in space in ESB

there are people walking in an asteroid with the apparent mouth of said monster open, so why are Leia, han and chewie not at all affected?

Lukes plan in jabbas palace has more holes in it than the asteroid i mentioned before

a literal representation of vietnamese soldier teddy bears can take down an entire imperial army 

general grievous despite having organic organs can survive in space

If midi-chlorians  existed as a known thing why didn't obi-wan or yoda mention them (obviously because GL made them up after but the point still stands its an error)

why did the emporer set up a trap for the rebels but then give them the real information to take down the empire if they just got past the trap which they did

hold up han was in a literal snow storm and that wampa could of taken luke anywhere but he just magically finds him?

i guess R2 just didn't wanna let luke know about Leia or anything that happened during the clone wars

or the fact that padme and anakin are supposed to hide their relationship yet at the end of AOTC she runs to him and hugs him in joy

or that uncle owen doesn't remember 3PO

or the fact obi-wan said yoda trained him but nope it was apparently qui-gon

and how did anakin become a force ghost with out training?

even though yoda had fought the emperor and warned him about his power i guess he just thought teaching luke to block force lightning wasn't important 

why would han not know of the jedi/force if chewbacca literally fought with them in TCW guess chewie just didn't think it was important to mention despite travelling with 2 of them in ANH

obi-wan decides changing Leias name is a good idea when being adopted into a family but not lukes, or hell why even raise luke as a nephew tell owen and beru to raise him as their son so he doesn't want to know about his family, or you know take luke from owen when its time to train him, sorry owen and beru but the galaxy needs saving and we don't want another anakin on our hands by training him too late.

obi-wan is told the sith are in control of the senate, he figures out dooku is the apprentice of the sith, he figures out jango fett works for dooku who works for the sith and that jango is the base of the clones but doesn't think to himself ""hm maybe the clones are controlled by the sith/senate and aren't trust worthy""

guess luke doesn't care his aunt and uncle just died, one intense stare then off we go into space

Seems Leia didn't care much about her planet and family dying either seeing as awhile later she's cracking short storm trooper jokes

""terminate her immediately"" some how still hasn't been killed long enough for luke and han to come save her

anakin never said he wanted luke to have his saber, obi-wan seems to really like lying 

Grievous your telling obi-wan about dooku training you as if you haven't met before in TCW

mace windu to palpatine: your under arrest 5 minutes later: ima kill you now

how does obi-wan or yoda not remember R2 or R2 remember yoda

""only a master of evil darth"" oh i guess the name anakin couldn't make it

how did a trash compactor monster get onto a space station let alone into the trash compactor

How tf does Leia remember padme

obi-wan wins using the ""high ground against anakin, guess darth maul didn't get the memo 

since when tf did R2 have rockets to fly and why didn't he use them in the OT

Anakins lightsaber changes literally almost every movie

so a robot (3PO) with speakers but putting your hand over his ""mouth"" stops the noise

why didn't obi-wan use force speed to run through the laser shields to help qui-gon, like dude your master died because of that.

i guess han just forgot lando betrayed them last time he saw them

24,My thaoughts about the whole SW films,1594551654,"Lets begin with the OT moovies. I think they will be always the best of the best all time, cos everything was fresh,new it has a cozy,chilling atmosphere watching them. George Lucas created  an amazing universe with it. The characters, the story, the force and everything feels so good. The most beatiful thing to me is the Luke and Vader conflict, ending with Lukes love for his father and believing him and Vaders redemption. Yoda teaching Luke about the force is also my fav. scene, i always get goosebumps from it. Also Obiwans confrontation with Vader( but it just became when ep 3 was relesed).

Now the prequels. I like these moovies also. The reason why i liked them is this: After the OT films i was wery much interested with the Jedi order, how it was functioned, the clone wars that was mentioned in the OT, Obiwan when he was a young Jedi, fighting in a war. Again George managed to expand the universe, bringing new to the table. These are good star wars moovies,  if you look at them like regular stand alone moovies then they have issues. Ep. 3 was able to fill me with emotins, just like the OT managed. I say i put Ep3 to the very best star wars film. Obiwan and Anakins conflict is just beatiful to watch. Wee saw them through 3 films becaming close friends outside of the formal Master padawan relation. To me this is beatiful. It had a good start, with a weak follow up, but the last is make up for it.

And for last the sequels. I dont like them. The main problem for me is comeing from this: Disney should have not touch or continue where Ep.6 was ended. We had a complete Skywalker saga. A beatiful story, with force, friendship,love,betray, faith and redemption. When Disney bought LF i kinda knew they just want to grab a lot of money out of it and not really care about the franchise. Wich was true. They played safe and made the sequels copy the OT films. They destroyed everything what 6 films before builded up. When you look at them as Star Wars films, they are very bad. When you look at them as normal films, they are blockbusters disguised with Star Wars skin.",StarWars,CaptainKolos,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hpsnjp/my_thaoughts_about_the_whole_sw_films/
25,would a holdo manoeuvre actually do anything substantial to the death star?,1594550288,"so snoke ship the supremacy was 60KM in length

the death star was 900KM in diameter and a lot more dense and armoured, we even see in ROTJ that a star destroyer crashing into it does almost nothing granted not going light speed but still shows that its mass alone couldn't damage it.

and even when the light speed ram hit the supremacy it only took a wing off and the ship seemed largely still functional and from the looks of it not that many people actually died and in addition to that the raddus (the resistance ship 34KM) was the biggest and most valuable ship the rebel fleet had ever owned, its not like they could just buy then in the masses and spam destroy them

Hello! I want some opinions on my the idea I got the other which I haven‚Äôt been able to get out of my mind.

I was watching the scenes from the battle of geonosis and it got me thinking. How awesome wouldnt it be to have a game, that is set in the clone wars and you play as a jedi general. The game will be a singleplayer game where it is about your campaign through the universe and it starts om geonosis. And it either ends at order 66 or is released as 2 games to really flesh out the story.

Im thinking the mechanics should be a little like the mount and blade series, where you will lead your clones into battle. You will be able to name them, talk with them, strategize, split them up into smaller squads, give them ranks etc. 

My favorite era is clone wars and to me its sad that there is lacking quality games from that time. And I this kind of RPG, campaign game would be so cool.

32,Anakin saves Padme. My fan fic chapter,1594541096,"Star Wars: Reverse, Season I, Chapter 12

After hearing this, Anakin felt numb and thought he was going to collapse. *What? Bomb? Padme?!*

Anakin flew out of the office in terror. He needed to save Padme. Get to her office in time. *NOW.*

&amp;#x200B;

‚Äì ‚ÄúOh my Force!‚Äù ‚Äì The Chancellor was terrified. ‚Äì ‚ÄúSet a message to the Jedi Council and alert everyone. I want the Council to send a Jedi to save Senator Amidala!‚Äù

Anakin jumped into his speeder, and without alerting anyone in the Jedi Council, flew at almost light speed to save Padme.

‚Äì ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt lose you my Star‚Äù. ‚Äì Anakin was thinking while riding. ‚Äì ‚ÄúNot today, not ever‚Äù.

Meanwhile, the Chancellor‚Äôs message reached out to the Jedi Council. Everyone was in pure shock.

‚Äì ‚ÄúSenator Amidala is help ours needed‚Äù. ‚Äì Said Master Yoda.

‚Äì ‚ÄúMaster Coleman Kcaj, you go and save the senator‚Äù. ‚Äì Said Mace Windu. ‚Äì ‚ÄúAlso, Obi-Wan ‚Äì have you seen Skywalker?‚Äù

‚Äì ‚ÄúThis is not important now‚Äù. ‚Äì Said Obi-Wan. ‚Äì ‚ÄúOur only focus is Senator Amidala‚Äôs safety‚Äù.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, Anakin reached Padme‚Äôs office, that luckily, wasn‚Äôt exploded. He spotted his wife near the window. She was looking calm ‚Äì she still didn‚Äôt know about the bomb? Hadn‚Äôt the Jedi warned her?

‚Äì ‚ÄúGet away from the window!‚Äù ‚Äì Anakin screamed to Padme. Padme looked terrified, but listened and ran away as far as she could.

Suddenly, Anakin jumped and broke the window. Padme was standing there shocked. After regaining consciousness, Anakin ran to Padme and grabbed her by the hand.

‚Äì ‚ÄúPadme, we need to run ‚Äì there is a bomb in your office!‚Äù ‚Äì Anakin screamed.

Padme was shocked and froze, but immediately snapped out and ran away with Anakin. Anakin‚Äôs plan was to jump in the speeder and fly away, but suddenly, while jumping, they didn‚Äôt reach the speeder and fell down.

Luckily, Anakin grabbed Padme and they both fell with a safety. Suddenly, there was a terrible explosion. Padme and Anakin were laying on the ground, covered in dirt and looking at the office that had just blown up.

&amp;#x200B;

Anakin helped Padme to get up and she started crying almost hysterically. Anakin hugged her and they both let out their shock.

‚Äì ‚ÄúEverything is okay now, my Star‚Äù. ‚Äì Anakin kept sobbing silently. ‚Äì ‚ÄúYou are safe now‚Äù.

When Padme stopped crying, Anakin took her by the hand and they prepared to go to the speeder together.

&amp;#x200B;

Suddenly, Anakin sensed someone. He turned, and in a split second, threw Padme on the ground. A blaster shot was made in a place, where Padme was standing *one second ago*.

Anakin spotted that person, a *bounty hunter*, who tried to fly away.

*Anakin was boiling with rage*. He used the Force and the hunter was slammed to the ground.

The hunter tried to get away, but Anakin lifted him up and started strangling him.

‚Äì ‚ÄúWho sent you?!‚Äù ‚Äì Anakin demanded answers.

‚Äì ‚ÄúThe‚Ä¶ Sith‚Ä¶ Lord‚Äù‚Ä¶  ‚Äì The bounty hunter was gasping for air. ‚Äì ‚ÄúHe‚Ä¶ Wanted‚Ä¶ Me‚Ä¶ To‚Ä¶ Kill‚Ä¶ Her‚Äù...

&amp;#x200B;

Anakin threw him on the ground and immediately slashed him in a half with his lightsaber.

Padme got up and ran to Anakin. He was breathing heavily, but Padme without any words hugged him from behind, and calmed him down.

&amp;#x200B;

Suddenly, Anakin and Padme heard a ship. This ship seemed to noticed them and landed in front of them. Jedi Master Coleman Kcaj exited the ship.

‚Äì ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad that you are okay, Senator Amidala‚Äù. ‚Äì He bowed to Padme and turned to Anakin.

33,Picture This...,1594539387,"Following the end of Season 7 of the Clone Wars, Disney and Lucasfilm begin production on a new animated Star Wars show that would air on Disney+ that takes place during the OT.  Imagine, we get to watch these interesting moments that (would) take place after ANH and up to the end of ROTJ/sometime past it:  we get to see the Rebellion struggle to escape the Empire following the destruction of the first Death Star, because despite the big W the Rebel Alliance took at the Battle of Yavin they still were massively outnumbered, and say we get to see them try to recruit new forces into the alliance, Luke going on quests trying to discover more about his father, Obi-Wan, the Jedi, the Force, etc, and we also get to see the rebels set up their base on Hoth that shows up in the Empire Strikes Back.  Also, we would (hopefully, at least I think this would make sense and also be very fulfilling to both Original Trilogy and Prequel/Clone Wars fans) get to see Luke meet Ahsoka and/or Rex following his defeat by Vader, we figure out what they're up to (and more specifically what Ahsoka was doing during the OT) and perhaps we get to see her train Luke more (which would explain why he was so powerful by the time Return of the Jedi happened), and it would also help Luke learn a lot more about Anakin directly from the people who were around him on a daily basis, (I think it would make a lot of sense for them to have met, as there is a book written by Luke Skywalker that discusses events and parts of the Clone Wars, which also has a passage about Ahsoka, which would most likely mean that their paths have crossed at some point), while also opening the possibility of giving closure to Ahsoka regarding her relationship and friendship with Anakin and Obi-Wan with a force ghost scene of them at the end of ROTJ or something.

First theirs Padme, it's like he just let that happen. And then theres the trouble about his mother, he could of helped Anikan instead of pushing it to the side.  Obi should of sensed Anikan being so troubled and took him for more training, elsewhere. Could Vadar of been avoided?

I'd like to think so after all Vadar had jedi in him all along so its conceivable the dark side was a choice and not some ""ultimate fate"". I'd like to see a Darth Maul spin off as the antihero and old Anikan the jedi.

The prophecy states that the chosen one would bring balance to the force. Its hinted that this was actually Luke who did this, as Anakin turned to the dark side. Instead of destroying the Sith, he joined them.

However, when you look at it one way, Anakin did just that.

The Jedi interpreted ‚Äúbalance‚Äù as the destruction of the Sith. However, how is a republic policed by hundreds of Jedi with only (officially) two Sith due to the rule of 2, balanced? Especially if the Sith are wiped out entirely? Only Jedi is far from balanced.

25,The sequel trilogy is about legacy,1594511122,"Something that I feel often goes amiss when we discuss the sequel trilogy are the themes behind it. While each movie has its own themes unique to film in question the trilogy as a whole is, in my opinion, about legacy and our relationship with legacy. 


Legacy as a central theme is most clearly evidenced in both Rey and Kylo Ren as they face (and subsequently handle/overcome) the legacy that came before them and what it means/how to create your own legacy in the shadow of what came before. 

Rey is a clear example of this. In TFA she's longing for purpose and longing to have her parents come and show her something bigger than the junk planet Jaku. She is confronted with having to create a legacy for herself that's bigger than anything she ever thought possible when Luke's lightsaber calls to her. She has to become a Jedi, a myth. By the end of the film she does become a Jedi, or at least start down that path. 

Kylo Ren deals with legacy in TFA as well. He is a legacy child, the last Skywalker. He's doing everything he can to live up to the legacy of Darth Vader, failing along the way and trying to extinguish his past though the killing of his father. He's something he doesn't want to be and in trying to deny that he only does himself more harm. 


In TLJ the theme of legacy is further reinforced in all of the principal characters. Rey has to wrestle with the fact that she comes from nowhere, is nobody, and despite all of that is fully capable of living up to the legacy that came before her. (While we later learn that nowhere/nobody is a lie what's important is how it effects her in this moment of the story) She learns that legacy is something you can build for yourself, not something you have to inherit. 

Kylo Ren is struggling with his own failure and decides that he wants something more than the legacy left by Darth Vader. Since he can't live up to that legacy he'll create his own. This is a sentiment he references in his famous ""Let the past die. Kill it if you have to."" It's also reflected in his want to dismantle the Jedi and the sith to create something new. 

Luke is also struggling with legacy. Skywalker is a legend and it's a legend that he's failed to live up to. The Galaxy needs the legend but he's just a man who failed. By the end of the film he revives the legend of Luke Skywalker to give the Galaxy one last spark of hope in a pacifist way that's true to the teachings of the Jedi, the legacy he failed to live up to before. 

When TRoS comes around Rey and Kylo Ren wrestle with legacy one more time. Rey is faced with her own history. Her legacy isn't coming from nothing. It's far worse. Her legacy is one of death, destruction, and pure evil. In this film she confronts her legacy and decides to be more than what came before her. She decides to be something better. She creates a new legend and a new legacy that she can be proud of, even taking on the name Skywalker so they can live on in her. 

Kylo Ren similarly struggles with legacy again. He sees where his new legacy is going and who it is serving and instead of following it further he decides to live up to his name and fight the emperor and the first order. This might have been his first choice that wasn't lorded over or influenced in favor of Palpatine through this entire Trilogy.






This is my little rant about what I believe is the throughline that travels through this new trilogy. A meta reading of this trilogy is the film makers struggling with living up to George Lucas. While I find this argument has validity I like to separate the creator from the work they created. 

I'd love to hear what all of you think and continue the discussion. Please keep it civil, I know we all have strong feelings about the sequels but without civility it stops being fun.

47,Why the clones being used doesn‚Äôt mean the Jedi were stupid,1594504364,"I‚Äôve seen a lot of people that say the Jedi are stupid in the prequels. Especially for using a random clone army. I don‚Äôt actually think it shows that.
First of all, Master Sifo-Dyas was part of the Jedi order. While people may have thought he was crazy, there was nothing to say he was untrustworthy.
Second, the Republic was going up against a do-it-yourself army. The Separatists had an enormous army that they built themselves. They didn‚Äôt even need to have man power behind it, just money. The end of Episode 2 shows that the Jedi were vastly outnumbered and easily overpowered by the droid army. They were the only form of enforcement the Republic had so, they needed an army if they wanted to stand a chance and that was the only instant army they had.

Third, this point isn‚Äôt very well informed since I haven‚Äôt read much but was it the Jedi‚Äôs choice to use it? It‚Äôs the army of the Republic. Did the senate or its supreme chancellor make the call and were the Jedi put in charge of it because they were the closest thing to a military that the Republic had? 

Well those are my points.

TL;DR The Jedi aren‚Äôt stupid for using the clones because they ordered by someone that they had no reason not to trust, they were backed into a corner because the Separatists already had an instant army to overpower them and it‚Äôs possible that using the clones was actually the senates choice.",StarWars,Shredhead72,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hpijhp/why_the_clones_being_used_doesnt_mean_the_jedi/

62,My idea for a Republic Commando Sequel,1594502196,"I wont claim to be a writer and this is just a draft I put together for fun. So I will admit a lot of my thoughts are all over the place. This is open for discussion and ideas. I struggled with the ending so thats where I want the most feedback! I would like to adapt this into a fan fiction so I am looking for constructive criticism. I have laid it out as if it was a game 

Picking up right at the end of Republic Commando. Delts squad is called to the forward beach head and rendezvous with master yoda. They are given orders to move to the east of the beach into the forrest where separatist forces have broken through and rendezvous with Omega squad who have been tasked with stopping the separatists from establishing a beach head. Before they depart yoda tells them that he is sorry for the loss of sev and that he was a great soldier. 

Delta squad moves through the forest and eventually rendvous with omega who were working along side jedi knight Qid Proko (a male quarren) when they arrive they bare witness to overwhelming amount of separatists baring down on them. Scorch recommends that they go in around the flank and take out the tanks using a little explosive excitement. Delta takes out the tanks and manages to sandwich the separatists between them and omega. When the battle is over they find Qid holding one of the members of omega in his arms with one of the other members, RC-9999 known as nines, over his shoulder. Nines informs them that this is all that is left of his squad. Boss rests his hand on his shoulder and tells him that he knows its not easy to lose brothers and that when this is all over he will buy him a drink. 

Qid stands up and thanks delta and walks over to the edge of the forest looking over the beach. The squad begins to chat when scorch says they have new orders coming in. Boss raises his hand and palpatine flashes on screen. Its at the point that boss look towards qin and his memories contort. He sees all his memories of jedi being helpful and friends to the clone contort in a way that paints them as enemies as traitors. Boss mutters under his breath. They used us, they've betrayed the republic. Delta and nines raise their bladter and gun down Quinn. The camera fades to the sky and we see the title IMPERIAL COMMANDO come on screen as it fades away we hear the sound of a drop ship in the distance and in aurebesh we see some writing that translates then to ""1 year later""

By this point delta has been issued modified katarn class armor. It is sleeker with shoulder pads designating them apart. Delta has marked their helmets with jedi they have hunted. Now reassigned to the 501st, they have been joined now by nines. On board the dropship are delta as well as few standard non clone storm trooper that the empire has begun to integrate into their army as they have had some disagreements with the kaminoans and cost efficiency(more on that later) 

They have been called to an outer rim color that has been slowly uprising against the empire. An informant within the colony has reported that their are jedi hiding among them. Once they land we are introduced to Cora Grey

Cora is a human female, she is an inquistor tasked to assist delta squad in locating the rogue jedi, delta has worked with her before so we are greeted with some nice banter between her and the squad showing the relationship 

As delta approaches the town they see the citizens lined up being questioned by imperial agents. Boss comments how he doesn't understand why anyone would go against the empire, life has been largely unchanged since the changeover and cora comments that some people don't like change. Whether is be for the better or for the worst.

Delta and cora make their way through the town and are ambushed. Fighting breaks out. They make their way outside the town and encounter a jedi. Delta attempts to subdue as cora tries to cut them off when they finally catch up cora gets ready to kill the jedi, thats when we see who it is her, cere junda. 
As cora prepares to kill her, a young padawn approaches and before the Padawan can strike boss kills the Padawan as he turns his blaster towards the jedi cora tells him to wait. She extends her lightsaber towards cere and asks how many more jedi they know about. Cora cuffs her and brings the jedi back to the town. When they get back cora gets a message saying the bring the jedi to the newly established fortress inquisitorious. 

At fortress inquisitorious cere is tortured it is at this point delta sees first hand what the empire is capable of and some of the dark dealings. Cere cracks and reveals she was protecting other padawans and that she had been in contact with others who didn't trust the empire and that she know of one other planet where a rebel cell had been forming retaliating against empire rule. 

The grand inquistor Orders one of the other inquistors to take another commando squad and storm troopers and return to where delta found cere to capture the other padawns there. The grand inquisitor then informs cora and delta that they will be tasked with finding out how many more jedi are out there. Starting with the rebel cell cere mentioned. 

From here the game would follow deltas missions. Starting with discovering this rebel cell lead by a jedi in hiding. This would lead them on a chase to try and find other jedi as well as taking down enemies of the empire. Over the course of the game slowly delta would begin to question the empires motives and even cora would begin to think some of the things the empire was doing to be a bit unorthodox. 

We would discover that cora had once been a jedi but didn't think the republic or the jedi were helping the galaxy when the empire took over she willingly agreed to join them as she believed the jedi were a plight to the galaxy and this was the answer. But as orders came in to destroy civilian cities and torture enemies of the empire the line slowly becomes blurred for her. 

About half way through the game delta would be recalled to coruscant to join a special ops mission to Kamino. It would be told to them that Kaminoans were rebelling against the empire and formed their own clone army to fight back. The leader of the operation woukd be boba fett. 

Once on kamino delta would be tasked with tracking down the Jango fett data and erase it and then to make sure the kaminions were shut down destory the entire facility. 

Delta would make their way into the cloning facility and locate where the mainframe was where the jango DNA was. Boss would assign fixer with deleting all the data. Fixer, while going through all of the files, stumbles upon the data about the control chips imbedded in them. While he read through it a kaminionan scientist and a kaminoan commando squadron enters the room. Delta swiftly takes down the commandos and wounds the scientist. 

Delta asks about the control chips and the scientist says they were just doing what they were told. The scientist reveals that the empire wanted Kamino to triple its production of clones and not be paid anymore. Kamino told them it wasn't possible and that the DNA was becoming unstable. They would need a new host and more funding. When the empire refused. Kamino shut down cloning for the empire and amassed a small army from any DNA they had on site. The scientist said they had been in contact with an ex clone. Someone who said that he could help them. If they could get off planet they could take any soldiers he could get. The scientist tells them to go to Azure. A small planet near kashsyyk, that whoever was there could answer all their questions and help them. 

Delta makes backups of all the data they found and rigs the facility to blow. They tell the scientist there is still time to get off the the station. They contact boba and tell him that the data has been deleted the facility is set. They extract back to the star destroyer which takes them back to coruscant. 

Delta squad is granted leave after all of their efforts and they head to a local storm trooper bar, 79s. Cora accompanies them, at the bar boss sits with cora while the rest of the squad makes an attempt to woo some local woman. Boss asks cora if she knows about the chips and tells them about their experience on Kamino and about Azure. Cora says its dangerous to question the empire but says that if boss thinks they should investigate. She will accompany them. 

Delta squad returns to their barracks and boss informs them that cora is going to help them get to azure, cora creates a plan in where she will come to them in the middle of the night under the guise that they are to embark on an urgent mission. 

They steal an imperial shuttle and make the jump to azure. Once they land they make their way through the forest and encounter a small force accompanied by a jedi. Cora kills the jedi and the jedis padawn emerges from the shadows after the battle, shaking and nervous, the padawan ignites their saber and one of the squad members raises his rifle to the padawan but cora pushes it down with her hand and kneels down to tell the padawn its okay. She presses her hand against the padawns lightsaber and turns it off. She then takes it and helps the padawan up. As she does this a squad of soldiers emerges from the woods telling them to lower to their weapons. Cora ignites the padawans blue saber as well as her red one. From behind the soldiers we see a clone approach them. None other than Sev. 

Sev relinquished them of their weapons and takes them back to the base him and his soldiers have established. He explains on kasshyk that after delta left the turret he was on was destroyed he was left badly injured but was recovered by a group of wookies along with a jedi. The wookies healed sev, and since he never received order 66, he never turned. With the republic, now empire bearing down on kasshyyk he knew him and the jedi had to get off planet but vowed to help the wookies. They repaired a clone transport snd traveled to azure. They put out an encrypted transmission recruiting anyone who wanted safety from the empire. 

They learn from sev about the truth of the chips. When in contact with kamino sev learned of the chips and removed his. Delta squad gets their chios removed and agreed to join sev along with cora 

The conclusion of the game would see delta helping sevs squad raid an imperial star destoryer for weapons and supplies. While their they would be confronted by the grand inquistor who would inform them that cora told them everything. But then would say she's outlived her usefulness and kill her. The star destoryer was a ploy to lure them their. The inquistor would kill all of the delta and then lead an imperial sqaudron down to destory sevs base. The conclusion of the game would see trilla approaching the base saying this is where the fun begins. And the game would end",StarWars,dunderdan23,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hphxf0/my_idea_for_a_republic_commando_sequel/

74,What is the main reason it was bad for the Jedi to join the Clone Wars?,1594500009,"Some recent questions about KOTOR have gotten me thinking about this. 

In KOTOR and its sequel the Jedi Order is positioned as being in the wrong for not getting involved in the war and staying neutral. Its only after Revan falls that they get directly involved. 

On top of that Revan is seen by fans (and by the game) as being in the right for going out and fighting in the war on the republic's behalf. 

And yet when we look at the clone wars the Jedi are now in the wrong for doing what Revan did instead of doing what Revan's council wanted to do. 

I honestly think this all comes down to the clones but I don't want to go there yet. I want to continue on with other parts of the war for the moment. 

So to start off with we have Revan goes to war (good) council says wait (bad) vs PT Jedi go to war (bad). 

Well first lets look at the war. Unlike Revan's war which was an invasion by a hostile force this is a civil war fought between two opposing sides (well it was all a grand puppet show by the Sith but we the audience know that the characters don't untill its to late). The CIS and the Republic both have good points about themselves as well as having real problems. The main one for the CIS being the Sith. 

A war between the Republic and CIS was always going to happen due to the sith. It was part of a grand plan to weaken the Jedi and the Republic. And while they may not know that the Sith are behind each side they know that the Sith are in charge of the CIS so they automatically are the enemy. 

and this isn't the first time the Jedi have went to war against the sith or to protect the Republic from the sith or fought with the republic against a sith led force. 

Aside from KOTOR we have the Great Sith War, Great Hyperspace War, Galatic Cold War, and the New Sith Wars. The Jedi have always defended the Republic and Galaxy from the Sith and its always been shown as a positive thing. 

Maybe here the argument could be made that most of those wars were made up of sith and sith loyalists. But while a lot of the smaller planets wanted more rights and better support the major players of the CIS still knew who they were working for and wanted personal power from it. 

Those smaller powers were just useful tools as far as the CIS leaders and sith were concerned. Maybe the Jedi should have tried harder to get them to flip sides but its still them facing a army led openly by the Sith. 

What about protecting the Republic even if the sith weren't involved? I mean skipping by the fact that if the Sith weren't around the Republic wouldn't have been as corrupt and the CIS would never have formed we are told first thing in ANH that the Jedi protected the Republic for 1000 generations. And again in KOTOR Revan goes off to protect the Republic from invasion and this is seen as good. 

Well fighting the sith and fighting for the republic has always been something the Jedi have done. Is it that they are leading armies and calling themselves generals?

I find this hard to believe. Again going back to Kotor we see Jedi leading armies, Bastila is renowned for her battle meditation. In other works we see Jedi leading armies (Darth Bane, Knight Errant, Tales of the Jedi) or fighting alongside armies. So it can't just be that Jedi are involved in fighting a war as generals unless we now want to say that Revan was wrong and the council was right.  And in all cases the Jedi have fought to protect the Republic because their allegiance is to the force and while the Republic isn't always the best government its always better than the alternative and the best government to allow the lightside of the force to flourish. 

This is what makes the Clone Wars and the decades of sith manipulation of the Republic and the Trade Federation and other guilds so perfect. It plays into what the Jedi have always done. The Jedi have always protected the republic because that means protecting the Light and protecting the innocent. 

Yes the smaller members of the CIS had valid points (in part due to things Sidious and his master had put in motion) but they were still the invading force attacking the Republic (tell me honestly that Dooku or Palpatine would have allowed the war to stop if the Republic called for peace?) and still a force controlled and aligned with the sith, a group that had brought nothing but pain and destruction and tyranny to the galaxy for 7000 years

So I think honestly the only thing that separates their action in the Clone Wars from every war previously is the army they are leading and who they let lead it. 

As I said before the Jedi have been Generals and Admirals before. However in all of those wars they always led other Jedi and conscripts/volunteers. They led normal men and women who signed up or were drafted into duty. The Clone Wars was the only war in which they led a army that had no say in if they wanted to fight or not. 

And while its not technically the only war where padawans and younger knights were fighting (Some like the New Sith Wars did but only because at that point both the Jedi and Sith orders were nearly exhausted and few were left on either side) in this one they don't really have the excuses of the others for why their are 15 and 16 yr olds out on the battlefields. 

I honestly think that the only problem with the Jedi being involved in the Clone Wars and the only thing that makes it the wrong decision here where it was the right decision in KOTOR is that they are leading a army of basically slaves and letting young padawans take part. 

I mean their was really nothing they could do. That's what makes the Clone Wars such a perfect trap. If they don't take command of the army the Republic would still use it. Or if the Republic didn't use it then the Republic would be destroyed.  I'm not saying the Republic is the light side. No mortal government could be. But its always been a beacon of the lightside and allowed it to grow. And letting the republic fall would be the same as letting the light go out. So as far as the Jedi were concerned they had no choice. 

So honestly yeah other than the Clones and Young Jedi involed in the war I don't see how its any worse or different than all the ones that came before.

1,"My fan fic version of Rey. Don‚Äôt judge too hard, please",1594493822,"My fan fic version of Rey. Don't judge too hard, please

*Here is what I came up with:*

&amp;#x200B;

*In here, Rey is Luke's Padawan and been training her whole life. She also uses a double-bladed yellow lightsaber*

Rey was grown to be the best in everything. And her behaviour represents it.

She is rude and arrogant teenager, who is aware of her power and dark nature. She likes to show her powers around, and basically saying: ""I'm better than you!"" She also seems thick-skinned, because despite the fact that other padawans fear her, she isn't influenced by this. In fact, she is not afraid to bully back when someone bullies her.

But also, she is a very difficult character, with flaws sticking everywhere out of her - she wants her power to be recognised, and always wants more. She has teenager problems - her friend Ben Skywalker-Solo is in love with her and Rey deep down loves him too, but she is too clueless and proud to accept his feelings.

Rey also doesn't like to be protected - like when she wants to be able to go on missions herself, not with the help of her Master - Luke.

For her whole life, she believed that she is a Chosen One, but she isn't. In fact, she is just a powerful nobody.

She also struggles with anger and sometimes can't control her emotions. Her fighting style is even deeply influenced by her emotional state. Usually, she uses her anger and it greatly benefits her.

I think that it would be better to have a bad trilogy made better and repaired than have a bad trilogy just ignored and swept under the rug.

40,Clones and romantic/sexual relationships,1594484844,"

Can clones consent to non clones? And Is it ok for clones to be in a romantic relationship with each other? 
I am going to give my opinion on these questions. 

During the clone wars the oldest clones where 14, but they looked like adults. Did they have the mind of adults? They certainly don‚Äôt act like 14 year olds, but how much of that is training and how much is who they are? the clones don‚Äôt have a still developing brain like most 14 year olds, they are physically adults. But they don‚Äôt have any relationship experience, the clones can‚Äôt recognise the difference between a good and bad relationship, and since they are basically slaves that problem is even worse. I think the clones can‚Äôt consent to non clones especially Jedi who all have extreme positions of power over them.
So that is the first part, in my opinion clones can‚Äôt consent to non clones.

Can clones consent to clones? And Is it incest?
I am of the opinion that if for example Luke and Leia had gotten together it would have been fine, in my opinion the main issue with insect is grooming as well as power differences that can cause very bad relationships. In my opinion a clone cannot consent to there commanding officers, much like with the Jedi the power differences are to big, a commander could pressure the clone under him in command to comply.  
Now I do not think the clones regard each other as brothers, there‚Äôs simply to many of them, I wouldn‚Äôt think of millions of people as my siblings. Instead I think they regard there batch mates as siblings but not all of the clones as that makes the most sense in my opinion.

62,"My fan fic version of Rey. Don't judge too hard, please",1594480225,"*Here is what I came up with:*

&amp;#x200B;

*In here, Rey is Luke's Padawan and been training her whole life. She also uses a double-bladed yellow lightsaber*

Rey was grown to be the best in everything. And her behaviour represents it.

She is rude and arrogant teenager, who is aware of her power and dark nature. She likes to show her powers around, and basically saying: ""I'm better than you!"" She also seems thick-skinned, because despite the fact that other padawans fear her, she isn't influenced by this. In fact, she is not afraid to bully back when someone bullies her.

But also, she is a very difficult character, with flaws sticking everywhere out of her - she wants her power to be recognised, and always wants more. She has teenager problems - her friend Ben Skywalker-Solo is in love with her and Rey deep down loves him too, but she is too clueless and proud to accept his feelings.

Rey also doesn't like to be protected - like when she wants to be able to go on missions herself, not with the help of her Master - Luke.

For her whole life, she believed that she is a Chosen One, but she isn't. In fact, she is just a powerful nobody.

She also struggles with anger and sometimes can't control her emotions. Her fighting style is even deeply influenced by her emotional state. Usually, she uses her anger and it greatly benefits her.

In rebels we then see Fenn Rau and his protectors on concord dawn. These people were supposedly involved in the clone wars, training troops and even fighting in battles with the republic. How doesn‚Äôt this directly contradict the pacifist and neutral Mandalore we saw in the clone wars?

The only group that we see fight with the republic are Bo katan‚Äôs deathwatch and that was strictly for the siege of Mandalore. Why then does Fenn rau consider Bo katan‚Äôs death watch as traitors when they helped to liberate Mandalore from maul and his group of death watch?

This isn‚Äôt even mentioning the Mandalorian show that introduces the cult that we don‚Äôt see anywhere else in the series, the one that has the no helmet rule and foundlings as a major part of the culture. Djin was rescued by death watch as we saw in the flash backs but none of them follows this religion?

I didn‚Äôt grow up with Luke, I was born in 2005 and my love of Star Wars has always been toward the PT and ST. 

My biggest gripe is how everyone says Luke is some saintly optimist when he really isn‚Äôt. He kills everyone who gets in his way without hesitation. The only characters he doesn‚Äôt try to shoot point blank in the face like Jabba are Vader only after finding out the truth and palpatine because.... I honestly don‚Äôt know. Hell even with all his optimism it doesn‚Äôt stop him from beating Vader within an inch of his life after Vader made a hollow threat.

The only Luke I do like is the one in the Sequel Trilogy. His character makes totally sense from my perspective.

Sorry if I insulted any of you. I just get so annoyed with all the hero worship for Luke. He is an okay character as a self insert but I really don‚Äôt think he deserves the praise he gets lately.

Things i really like and it does well:

gives deeper insight into the resistances relationship with the new republic

it actually goes deep into how the first order rose to power, something that always bugged me is how the new republic could let another empire rise and this show seems to be going into and answering that pretty well

Poe and BB-8, thanks to this show i actually think i might like poe and BB-8 over luke and R2, poe is just adorable in how he treats BB-8 and how much he cares about him its pretty funny and made me appreciate their relationship a bit more

we get to see characters like Poe, Leia and Kylo, hux and phasma

and we get to see a bit more of kylos strength in the force as well which is pretty cool

now things that aren't too great:

The animation is still not great or easy to get over

i agree with the sentiment that the show doesn't get interesting until after the first 6 episodes and it should be noted even after those some episodes are still not very good that is just when good episodes begin to re-occur

the main cast outside of Kaz, torra and yeager and Doza are sort of boring or annoying there isn't really an in between.

So does resistance hold a candle to clone wars or even rebels? no absolutely not but it's honestly not that bad either and seeing as were stuck in quarantine anyway, might as well give it a watch and get some more insight into how the first order rose to power.",StarWars,NoNameMike92,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hp8r0d/star_wars_resistance_is_actually_alright/

*I'm sorry for not posting long. Hope you enjoy this one.*

&amp;#x200B;

Padme was standing in front of the Jedi Council members and was telling her story to them. Both Padme and Anakin were immediately dragged to the Council meeting and didn‚Äôt even got time to change, so they both were in the same dirty and torn clothing. 

 ‚Äì ‚ÄúI told you everything I know‚Äù. ‚Äì Padme said end sat on the sofa. Mace Windu bowed to her and turned to Anakin.

 ‚Äì ‚ÄúNow, Master Skywalker, you told us that it was the *Sith Lord* who tried to kill Senator Amidala, right?‚Äù

 Anakin breathed in.

 ‚Äì ‚ÄúYes. The bounty hunter told me himself. I sensed everything - he wasn‚Äôt lying‚Äù.

 After Anakin finished, everyone for some reason looked at Master Yoda. Yoda had a thoughtful look on his face. Finally, he got up.

 ‚Äì ‚ÄúTo a serious war we prepare must‚Äù. ‚Äì Was all Master Yoda could say. 

 Everyone looked devastated. The Sith hadn‚Äôt shown their noses since the Clone Wars. *Now, they declared a war.*

&amp;#x200B;

 Anakin exited to the balcony to breathe some fresh air. He was scared, but the rage of the revenge was stronger.

 Now, he was almost *obsessed* with finding the Sith Lord and started to invent a plan. Suddenly, he heard the door opening and Obi-Wan had entered the balcony. He saw Anakin and went to talk to him.

   ‚Äì ‚ÄúWhat are you thinking about? Aren‚Äôt you supposed to discuss plans with the Council?‚Äù

 ‚Äì ‚ÄúWhy bother?‚Äù ‚Äì Anakin said. ‚Äì ‚ÄúMaster Windu will not hear me out or accept one of my suggestions anyway‚Äù.

 Obi-Wan laughed a little.

 ‚Äì ‚ÄúYeah, you are sure not his personal favorite. But I say it‚Äôs entirely your fault‚Äù.

 Anakin raised his eyebrow.

 ‚Äì ‚ÄúWhy? What do I did, you think?‚Äù

 Obi-Wan laughed even louder and patted Anakin on the shoulder.

 ‚Äì ‚ÄúYou are not a boring emotionless monk‚Äù.

 Now, it was the turn for Anakin to smile.

‚Äì ‚ÄúThen, based on your words, *you* shouldn‚Äôt have been a fan of me either‚Äù.

Obi-Wan rolled his eyes and they both laughed. 

Anakin looked to the void. The smile was disappearing from his face. Obi-Wan looked at him too and just said one sentence:

‚Äì ‚ÄúI miss our younger years‚Äù. 

Anakin turned to Obi-Wan and gave him a bland look. It was clear Anakin missed those years too.

&amp;#x200B;

 ‚Äì ‚ÄúWho do you think is the Sith Lord?‚Äù ‚Äì Obi-Wan suddenly asked. Anakin was taken aback by this, but still replied: 

 ‚Äì ‚ÄúI honestly don‚Äôt know. It must be someone with power, to cover himself or herself up‚Äù. 

 ‚Äì ‚ÄúI agree‚Äù. ‚Äì Obi-Wan answered, but Anakin started thinking more.

 ‚Äì ‚ÄúSomeone important‚Ä¶ Politicians‚Ä¶ Senators‚Äù ‚Ä¶ ‚Äì Anakin was thinking. He didn‚Äôt trust politicians very much, but still didn‚Äôt want to make accusations without any proof. 

‚Äì ‚ÄúSorry, Obi-Wan, I need to go‚Äù. ‚Äì Anakin stopped thinking and suddenly quickly left. Obi-Wan just looked at Anakin‚Äôs direction and didn‚Äôt stop him. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anakin was quickly walking around, and saw Padme. He took her to a nearest room and quickly closed the door.

‚Äì ‚ÄúAni, what‚Äôs happening?‚Äù ‚Äì Shocked Padme asked him, worried. Anakin held her, looked her deeply in the eyes and told with a serious voice:

‚Äì ‚ÄúStar, listen to me: you are going to fly home and *stay there*, understood?‚Äù 

Padme was even more shocked now.

‚Äì ‚ÄúBut the kids! What about the kids? The Sith Lord is out there, it‚Äôs too dangerous to leave them here‚Äù.

‚Äì ‚ÄúPadme‚Äù. ‚Äì Anakin said calmly and seriously. ‚Äì ‚ÄúIt will be too suspicious. From the Council‚Äôs point of view, you are a nobody to the kids‚Äù.

Padme sighed and looked at Anakin.

‚Äì ‚ÄúAnd where are *you* going?‚Äù ‚Äì Padme asked with a little worry in her tone.

Anakin sighed.

‚Äì ‚Äú*I will do what I must*‚Äù. ‚Äì Anakin said confidently. ‚Äì ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry Padme, but that‚Äôs my duty as the Chosen One. I will do it while the footprints are still fresh‚Äù.

Padme sighed again. She knew it was pointless to ask anything else.

 Anakin leaned and kissed Padme before he left. Padme silently hugged him. Anakin hugged her back and left.

 Anakin, without warning anyone again. He already had a plan*.*

 

 Anakin flew to the Senate and in secrecy and he went in without anyone seeing him. Anakin‚Äôs plan was to plant little cameras in each of the most influential senators‚Äô offices and try to catch the Sith Lord.

 Anakin understood that his plan was crazy and somewhat stupid, but it was everything he could do right now.

 He ‚Äúvisited‚Äù every office, tricked the guards and planted the cameras in there. Anakin was afraid, he felt horrible and guilty, but continued doing it.

 When Anakin finished and connected the cameras to his tablet, he prepared to walk out. Suddenly, he saw the Chancellor‚Äôs office and remembered that he forgot to plant cameras there.

 ‚Äì ‚ÄúThis is wrong‚Äù. ‚Äì Anakin thought to himself. ‚Äì ‚ÄúI trust the Chancellor‚Ä¶ He couldn‚Äôt be the‚Ä¶ Then why do I want to plant the camera in his office?‚Äù

 Anakin felt like garbage. Overpowering himself, he entered the Chancellor‚Äôs office and planed the camera.

 ‚Äì ‚ÄúEverything is going to be okay nonetheless‚Äù. ‚Äì Anakin was calming himself down, but deep inside he *knew* that there was something wrong.

 After the job was done, Anakin quickly left the Senate building. He didn‚Äôt fly very far away, but positioned himself where no one could find him. After everything, Anakin was just supposed to wait.

 And the wait was horrible. Anakin was looking on the screen for about two hours already. *Nothing*.

 Anakin was already thinking about to just drop this stupid plan. He turned off 3 calls from the Jedi Council already because of it.

&amp;#x200B;

 Suddenly, Anakin‚Äôs eyes feel on the Chancellor‚Äôs office. The Chancellor entered it, without *anyone, even the bodyguards*.

 Anakin became wary and looked closer. The Chancellor called somebody and begun talking. Anakin turned on the sound and saw something **horrible**.

 The Chancellor was saying *this*:

 ‚Äì ‚ÄúSo, the warrior failed to assassinate Senator Amidala. There is a change of plans‚Äù. ‚Äì *The Chancellor*said.

 ‚Äì ‚ÄúYou told me it‚Äôs a good thing, ***Darth Sidious***‚Äù. ‚Äì Said the Chancellor‚Äôs interlocuter. ‚Äì ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù  

Anakin‚Äôs eyes wided and he begun breathing heavily. **Darth Sidious?! WHAT?!**

 ‚Äì ‚ÄúI already told you not to call me by that name‚Äù. ‚Äì The Chancellor said with annoying tone.

 ‚Äì ‚ÄúI apologize, my Lord‚Äù. ‚Äì ‚ÄúWhat is the change?‚Äù

 The Chancellor smiled sinisterly.

 ‚Äì ‚ÄúPadme Amidala is not that disposable as I thought‚Äù. ‚Äì Said the Chancellor. ‚Äì ‚ÄúThe Chosen One killed the hunter. The Dark Side is still alive in him‚Äù.

 Anakin was boiling inside and did his best to calm himself down. *How dare The Chancellor call Padme disposable*! *How dare he trick everybody!* Twice, Anakin reached out his hand to choke the living heck out of the Chancellor, and twice Anakin was stopping himself.

 ‚Äì ‚ÄúNow, I just need to finally seduce him with the Dark Side and‚Äì‚Äù

 Suddenly, the Chancellor stopped talking and looked at the window. 

 ‚Äì ‚ÄúWait, I sense something‚Äù. ‚Äì ‚ÄúSomething strong‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs anger‚Ä¶ *This is Force*‚Äù.

&amp;#x200B;

 ‚Äì ‚Äú*Shit!*‚Äù ‚Äì Anakin breathed in and run away.

&amp;#x200B;

 The Chancellor excused himself from the call and looked around. He looked like he was suspicious, but dropped it and got back to the call.

&amp;#x200B;

 Anakin didn‚Äôt hear the rest of the dialogue. He turned off his tablet and ran behind the bottom of the Senate building, fell on the ground, and started breathing heavily.

&amp;#x200B;

 He couldn‚Äôt believe this. His friend, one of his mentors‚Ä¶ **Is a Sith Lord?!**

 Anakin didn‚Äôt know what to do with everything, but right now, everything was pretty *clear ‚Äì* ***The Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine is a Sith Lord named Darth Sidious.

Yet that's what Star Wars manages to do, and do very well. 

The lack of spite towards Vader from the filmmakers frames his story with such a compassionate and humanistic lens. You simply don't see that in mainstream cinema. 

Often there will be a cheap twist or the bad guy won't actually be bad - or controlled by some evil spirit. But nothing as complex as: here's this person who has done truly evil things, yet there is still some good in him. 

I just think tonally, that's so refreshing - any hint of 'revenge' or 'punishment' seen in characters is not rewarded by the writers - instead it's about converting people into being good. It's so much better than stories that either have comic book villains (yes palpy is kind of one, but he also represents evil/devil thematically and isn't the focus) or ""revenge-p*rn"" stories that get so morose and poe-faced that things just become a depression-fest.

Episode X:

Circa 45 ABY

Open with two alien fleets fighting. One is noticeably larger than the other, and does not use lasers. Neither is familiar.

Suddenly, six  *Resurgant*\-class battle cruisers appear from hyperspace. Each is heavily damaged, and the camera makes sure to show the first order symbol. The ships‚Äô engines flare and they fly toward the larger fleet at maximum speed, crashing into the largest warships.

Elsewhere, the galaxy is split. A number of worlds are independent, and the others are split between the FIRST ORDER, CONFEDERATION, and GALACTIC ALLIANCE. The Confederation and Galactic Alliance are allies against the First Order, although there is relative peace. The Galactic Alliance is led by Finn, while Poe is a general in its special forces.

Poe and his second-in-command, Sora, are examining an intercepted First Order report that details the disappearance of six battlecruisers two years before, as well as their last known locations. Wondering how so many ships could disappear, the two of them assemble a fleet. With them, they bring a much-older Hera Syndulla and Rey, who has been building the Jedi Order on Ahch-to. 

They travel to the Unknown Regions, where the battlecruisers were last seen, but find nothing. After exploring, they find the wreckage of a massive battle. Every ship in the system appears destroyed, except for one small vessel that identifies itself as the *Springhawk.* 

*Springhawk‚Äôs* commander contacts the Alliance fleet, and when his hologram appears, Hera immediately recognizes him as Thrawn. The leaders meet on the *Sprinhawk,* where Hera asks where Ezra is. Thrawn explains that the Chiss Ascendancy, and Ezra, have been fighting the advance forces of the Yuuzhan Vong, invaders from another galaxy, for decades. He explains that several others had fought with the Ascendancy, such as the Vagaari and Grysks, but only the Ascendancy is still standing, and is near falling.

After learning that a new force has attacked the planet on which Ezra is fighting, Thrawn and the Alliance fleet meet with a group of Chiss ships, and they go to fight the Vong. Though they are outnumbered, Thrawn‚Äôs tactics allow them to win, until a worldship drops out of hyperspace (not really hyperspace, whatever the dovin basaal travel is called). It is the first worldship that the Chiss have seen, and it causes huge damage to the Alliance/Chiss fleet, until Rey travels to the ship and destroys it, killing herself in the process.

Later, we see a series of short shots: more Vong ships arriving, Finn negotiating an alliance with other governments, and the few remaining Jedi joining the Alliance, ending the order for the final time (for real this time).",StarWars,VergenceScatter,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hp29n7/star_wars_episode_x_pitch/

1,Seeing C-3PO get bullied and belittled by the cast of Return of Skywalker was the perfect send off for such a useless character.,1594430881,"I'm so happy that JJ Abrams delivered on what the fans wanted and threw him in scrapheap and by extension, Anthony Daniels who was whining about his character (if you can even call it that) not getting enough screen time? I mean really? He is basically an appliance. 

&amp;#x200B;

I mean, other than the fact that in Episode 1, he is an example of Anakin's ability and love of tinkering to escape from the hell of living as a slave, and the fact that that ability allowed him to develop skills as a pilot and the force through pod racing, and the fact that the protocol droid would be able to help his mother around the house, symbolizing his love for his mother and foreshadowing how devastated he would be when she died, he is a meaningless character.  He has no bearing on the clone wars other than the fact that he is incidentally well versed in many forms of communication allowing him to facilitate the diplomatic side of the war and getting and keeping planets in the republic.

&amp;#x200B;

And in the original trilogy, he is similarly useless except for the fact that he is instrumental in delivering the secret plans to Ben Kenobi and and introducing the viewer to the broader universe of star wars and its perils and getting Luke into the fight and being the impetus for him to achieve his destiny, his existence has basically no meaning.

&amp;#x200B;

That's why it is a master stroke of writing that he is sidelined, marginalized, and belittled throughout the sequel trilogy and used for cheap gags, because that is basically all C-3PO and Anthony Daniels are useful for in the grand scheme of things.

I recently decided that with my saved money of about $250, I am intending to purchase a lightsaber of my own to save in my room. Hence, I would like to ask a few questions prior to purchasing.

1. So a local reseller in my country is selling a 2005 Mace Windu Master Replica for $100 and an Obi-Wan Hasbro Signature for $200. If you were in my shoes, which one would you prefer or rather would you not buy them at all?
2. I am also interested in buying a Galaxy Edge's Legacy Lightsaber. However, let's say due to an issue with money, will I be able to resell them easily and how would that affect the price? My assumption is that they would go down due to the continuing supply.
3. Last but not least, which lightsaber replica brands would you prefer most to buy and is most stable in reselling price? Is it a master replica/signature/any other brand?

24,How Rebels Saved My Relationship With My Dad (Seasons 1-2),1594426514,"SPOILERS FOR REBELS SEASON 1 AND 2. I'm not sure if I have to even say ""spoilers"" anymore... It's almost 6 years old! But it still holds up so frickin' well. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Introduction:**

Let me start off with a little bit of backstory.  These last few years, my dad and I haven't really gotten along very well. I could go into detail, but basically, long story short, we don't have the best relationship, because he's really devoted to his work and we don't really spend time together. Well, that changed recently, when Star Wars Rebels basically saved our relationship.

**Clone Wars:**

Anyway, let me explain how it started. On May 4th, 2020, I watched the last episode of The Clone Wars and I absolutely loved it. I just HAD to show it to someone else, someone who wasn't entirely familiar with Star Wars shows.  My brother? No. He couldn't care less about Star Wars. He knows the very basics, but just to give you an idea of how much he knows, he still confuses Ewoks with Wookiees... Anyway, the only other person I was quarantined with was my dad. So I asked him if he wanted to watch the last few episodes of Clone Wars Season 7, and he said yes, when he had the time. So we set up a time the day after it came out and we watched the last arc together. When the last episode was finished, I asked him if he wanted to watch Star Wars Rebels, because the last Clone Wars Episode tied in perfectly with Rebels. But, he said no, because he didn't want to get into a new story with new characters. 

&amp;#x200B;

About a month later, I started getting into baking, but needed help since it was my first time and I didn't want to turn the house into Anakin. (If you don't get the joke,  üëã You want to go home and rethink your life.  üëã). Anyway, I didn't want to burn the house down, so my dad helped me with the baking. 

**Rebels Season 1:**

After putting it in the oven, I suggested that we watch Rebels to pass the time. And he said yes! So we watched the first 2 episodes. He kept comparing Ezra to Aladdin, which I can TOTALLY see! Diamond in the rough (in a way), they steal to survive and they were both orphans who were on their own.  After those episodes, it became a nightly thing for us. Sadly, I don't remember many of his reactions from Season 1, but I do remember that when Ahsoka was first revealed, I'm pretty sure he teared up in happiness, because he was happy to see her again, and not dead, I guess. Also, he knows that I grew up with her character, and that she's one of the characters I love the most. (In more ways than one I guess, because in Kindergarten i told him that I had a crush on her). I also remember that,  on the last episode of Season 1, Grand Moff Tarkin says to Agent Kallus ""Not to worry Agent Kallus, The Emperor has sent an alternative solution"" which is followed by the deep sound of Vader's breathing and him walking by. My dad immediately pointed out that that line could be a reference to The Final Solution in Nazi Germany. Basically, according to the Holocaust Encyclopedia, the Final Solution was a term used by Nazi Germany's leaders, referring to the mass murder of Europe's Jews. Comparing that to Vader actually makes a ton of sense! Vader is a murderer! But this isn't a history lesson, so I'll just go and write about Season 2.

 

**Rebels Season 2:**

&amp;#x200B;

I actually just finished watching Season 2 with my dad today. We watched the last SEVEN EPISODES! I think he had the best reactions while watching Season 2, even though he says he didn't like it as much as the first one. 

In the second episode, When Vader attacks the Rebel fleet, and the Ghost crew rushes to stop him, my dad knew that there was no way that a few rebel ships could stop THE Darth Vader. After Ahsoka and Kanan reach out with The Force, Darth Vader says ""The apprentice lives!"" And Ahsoka passes out, which made my dad gasp. Then, in the 3rd episode, when Rex, Wolffe and Gregor were revealed, he was just like Kanan. He did NOT trust them one bit. And when it was revealed that Wolffe called the Empire, it just made him trust them even less. Throughout the season, there were a lot of Star Wars references, including ones that he wouldn't get, so every now and then I'd pause the show and explain to him what a character meant. For example, at one point a character said something about a ""Mynock minute"" and I had to explain to him what Mynocks were. And finally, the last two episodes... my favorite episodes in the series! He was surprised that Maul returned. In the scene where Ezra gets the Sith Holocron, and jumps back to Maul, Maul lifts him up with the force and reaches out towards the Holocron. And once he grips onto the Holocron, he smiles, and pulls Ezra up. My dad compared that scene to the scene in Aladdin, right after Aladdin grabbed the lamp and tries to escape the cave. When Aladdin was holding onto the edge of the cliff, the old man above him says ""GIVE ME THE LAMP!"", and Aladdin does it. I can definitely see the similarities.

I haven't really gotten to my point yet. My point is that watching Star Wars Rebels with my dad pretty much fixed our relationship, or at least brought it to a point where we're not constantly yelling at each other. Back in April, we weren't very close. But now, we have something that we can bond over and talk about. So, overall, I am really glad that my dad and I have found something that we both like, and I hope things keep getting better from here.

27,"Obligatory ""I just finished Clone Wars"" post",1594425852,"I feel like we see a post like this all the time in this sub, but it would be a total disservice to this show if I didn't make one.

Let's start at the beginning. I was hesitant to watch The Clone Wars because it is animated. I grew up with the Star Wars films being some of the only live-action media I consumed, and I was always enthralled by the spectacle. As I've grown up and entered the entertainment industry myself, I've come to appreciate Star Wars for more than just the spectacle. The story, characters, and world-building are simply incredible, and the fact that they can be coherent across so many forms of media is an achievement in and of itself. This was the first franchise I fell in love with, and it remains at the top only to be rivaled by one other for me (also owned by Disney as you could probably guess). I tried watching originally about six years ago, but just couldn't get past the first season due to various reasons. I was moving back from my first year of school, some of the episodes were very very childish (Jar Jar never disappoints in this), and I felt like I wasn't watching it in the correct order. I knew the show had ended, didn't want much to do with Rebels, and just resorted to watching the lightsaber duels on YouTube.

I don't need to say that this year has been an odd one. I was excited for Season 7, and I watched it all as it was released. The Manadalorian really impressed me, so I was glad I could get more out of Disney+. But I wanted more. So I found the list of episodes in chronological order, buckled down, and got ready for 133 episodes (with a theatrical release I didn't really enjoy when I was younger). Man am I glad I did.

People are not exaggerating when they say that TCW is some of, if not, the best Star Wars has to offer. The amount of world-building it does is absolutely insane. The amount of payoff and emotion it provides the films is astounding. I've always been a fan of the prequels, but this makes them so much better. We see so much more than the general audience has when it comes to Revenge of the Sith, and what really led to that after Attack of the Clones. The loss, anger, &amp; hate Anakin deals with during the war. The personalities of the Clones, the blindness of the Jedi, the total and utter brilliant execution of Palpatine's plan, and how a galaxy like this could so easily be ruled by an Empire that made the Jedi villains with a flip of a switch.

So many characters were fleshed out. The Jedi Masters were given distinct personalities, which makes their appearance in ROTS' Order 66 scene even more powerful. Bail Organa's friendship with Padme gives meaning to him adopting Leia. Commander Cody was treated with nothing but respect from Obi-Wan, but still fell to Order 66 in the end. The Kaminonians knew about the plan for Order 66. Captain Rex showing the wear and tear of the war physically with his armor, and mentally on his spirit and actions in the later episodes. Characters that wouldn't be big until the Galactic Civil War, like Chewbacca, Dengar, Bossk, Greedo, Boba Fett, and Saw Gerrera, made appearances to better weave them into the galaxy far, far away.

Some of the characters introduced in the Clone Wars rival those from the films in terms of appeal and character. Bounty hunters like Cad Bane &amp; Embo were so fricken cool. Darth Maul was given a real character (played by the same man responsible for my favorite Legends character). The Mandalorians showing how the war even took a toll on neutral systems and how the galaxy was much bigger than Jedi &amp; Sith, Republic &amp; Separatists. Hondo kept me on my toes, never knowing who he really would side with, all while being hilarious. The other beings that were sensitive of the Force, especially those on Mortis. Ashoka... who I fully believe is what Anakin would've been like had Qui-Gon survived and been his master.

If you consider yourself a fan of Star Wars and haven't seen this show, now is the time. I believe the Clone Wars is the most interesting time period of the franchise, and the series gets to show you so so much. The weight and reality of the war is far beyond what we see in the films, and it makes the characters and world better because of it. I want more stories, but know that is very unlikely to happen with the series pretty much officially ending. I'm now going to start Rebels to hold me over (even though I hate the skinny lightsabers) and am excited that I'll be reunited with some characters from TCW. Thanks for listening to the words of someone who considered themselves a big fan before they watched, and now is an even bigger one.

37,Let's talk about Midichlorians,1594397140,"Now I've seen a lot of heated debate over their inclusion in the lore, and I just want to offer my interpretation of the explanation given by Qui-gon in PM. I've heard a lot of people get upset saying that all of the mystery and intrigue of the Force is ruined by the Force being nothing but bacteria in your bloodstream. Robot Chicken even pokes fun at this in one of their sketches. But that isn't the interpretation that I got at all. From what I understood, midichlorians don't make up the Force, they're just a rare bacteria that FEEDS on the force. That being the case, midichlorians would be a fairly accurate way to scientifically measure someone's sensitivity to the Force. The more of the living Force that resides in an individual, the more midichlorians would be present to feed on that Force. Pretty straightforward from an ecological perspective. This would explain why Anakin's midichlorian count was so eyebrow raising. Obi-wan said it himself that they were ""off the charts."" They didn't immediately say ""yo, you're like the most powerful kid ever. Come with us."" They wanted to bring him to the temple to test him further and find out for sure.

TL;DR Midichlorians don't make up the Force, they're just an ecological method of testing to what degree the Force is present.

They helped us pinpoint where we are in the story every few minutes. Obi wan telling anakin to spy on the chancellor, and the final moments with mace which ahsoka and maul sensed and gave us an outside feel. Now when we rewatch rots, we can recall what ahsoka is doing at that very moment. Dave filoni is a beast. Even rebels is still accurate. Order 66 was really scary.

Now before you destroy me in the comments let me explain. I grew up right as the prequels were finished so I didn't properly grow up with starwars movies this resulted in me getting all my information about these movies second hand (heck I got most of it from the lego games). I never got to experience the wow factor of watching a trilogy unfold before my very eyes.

This resulted in me growing up watching the OT and prequels over and over again with my parents, I think watching these over and over again allowed me to fall I love with the starwars world, but in the process I kinda didn't care what happened to the characters.

All the feeling really culminated when I watched RoS because watching this new trilogy unfold left a bad taste in my mouth. I loved starwars because the world was fantastical and lifelike, all I needed was to get engrossed in some characters and my starwars experience would be complete. But the sequels kinda sucked so I am just sitting here without really any starwars movies that I really like.

To finish this off I'll just stare that I can admit that the OT are good movies, but I didn't grow up with them so they kinda feel dated in my mind.
