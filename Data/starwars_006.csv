3,Just watched the ‚ÄúTwin Suns‚Äù episode of Rebels. WOW.,1596740416,"I‚Äôm working my way through Rebels for the first time, just finished season 7 of Clone Wars. I knew that Obi-Wan faces Maul at some point in Rebels from seeing screenshots and whatnot throughout the years since it went off the air, but didn‚Äôt know when it occurred in the series. 

***SPOILERS IF YOU HAVEN‚ÄôT SEEN REBELS***

Once I realized that THIS was the episode, I was stoked. When Ezra woke up by the fire to find Obi-Wan sitting there, I just knew we‚Äôd get a ‚ÄúHello, there‚Äù from him, I assumed it‚Äôd be his voice from CW. To hear Ben Kenobi instead, fully sounding like Alec Guinness, it literally brought a tear to my eye. Was totally not expecting that. 

Wrapping the episode with now-Ben looking out and watching Luke, hearing Aunt Beru call out to him...WOW. And to end it all with the quiet ‚ÄúForce Theme‚Äù, it was just a breathtaking episode. 

I know I‚Äôm very late to this party, so apologies to everyone reading this and rolling their eyes because they experienced all of it years ago. Just wanted to share my thoughts on the episode.

10,I don't get the hate for Palpatine's Message being on Fortnite,1596739607,"I constantly see people saying it's dumb that the message was broadcast on Fortnite rather than the movie, but consider this:

Most of the title crawls reference a big off-screen event. The kidnapping of Palpatine, the stealing of the death star plans, the entire existence of the first order/resistance, etc. Palpatine's broadcast is just like that. 

Now I think pretty much the entire plot of Ep 9 is dumb. So whether or not there should have been a message to begin with might be debatable, versus Kylo just sensing him, versus him not being in the movie, etc. But assuming he announces himself with the broadcast, what does adding it to the movie actually do? And then, what do we learn in the title crawl? There would still have to be something to kick off the movie with. Like intel on Exogul, Kylo sensing something stirring, etc. It wouldn't really have changed anything imo. 

Idk, I just think people are being extra hard on this because ""Fortnite bad"". To me it's just brand synergy the same way the Rathtar planet being told in the Ep 7 Lego Star Wars game is (or all of Lego SW for that matter).  I think Ep 9 should have been like 30 minutes longer, or even 2 movies, but of all the problems, I just think this is a trivial silly one.",StarWars,yrqrm0,False,/r/StarWars/comments/i4xlgk/i_dont_get_the_hate_for_palpatines_message_being/

Plo Koon and Kit Fisto are two of my favourite background Jedi Council members, I wish they got more screen time because they are great characters. However, which one of them would win in a duel. Assuming both are in their prime, with no special conditions that would tip the scale in favour of either.

I think Plo Koon's mastery of Form V and knowledge of Form IV makes him an extremely talented duelist, and his abilities with The Force are also not to be trifled with. Kit Fisto is extremely well versed in Form I but compared to other forms of lightsabre combat, it's quite basic. Seems like an easy win for Plo Koon? Well not exactly. Kit Fisto's unpredictability makes him quite dangerous, as seen when he nearly beat Grievous at their first encounter.

I think it would be a close call because both are fairly even, but ultimately Plo Koon would take the victory due to his wider lightsabre combat knowledge. His chosen Form V has great defence and strong offense, while Fisto's Form I has basic offensive and defensive capabilities.

And oddly it seems like the ones recommended are always the more military sci-fi or sith/empire focused. I see Darth Plaegus and the Bane series recommended a lot more than Cloak of Deception even though people love Quigon. And their is more to the clone wars books that Republic Commando. People like Darth Maul but I never see Shadow Hunter recommended. 

Their was a good post on the fantasy subreddit where it basically compared two well known fantasy authors to pizza, everyone loves and knows about pizza. So seeing those two authors in every single thread even if they didn't match what the person was asking about felt like being told to eat pizza.

And the Vader comics are really good, probably one of the few things in the NEU comic lineup I would read multiple times. But their are still many more good comics out there.

76,"The Sequel Trilogy and ""planning""",1596725716,"Of all the criticisms of the Sequels, if there's one thing I don't understand, it's the assertion that the ST ""should have been planned from the start"". If the ST (or any film for that matter) didn't work for someone, it's not really an issue of how solid plans are.

Disliking a story is very rarely a problem with the creative process itself. It‚Äôs more a problem with the story or the way it‚Äôs being told. I never saw any issue with the approach Lucasfilm have made. In fact having a vague idea of what you‚Äôre building towards but letting each new filmmaker have freedom to tell the story they want to tell is a great way to appeal to the creative talent the franchise needs. Marvel, for example, have a rigid plan which may lead to a more consistent franchise, but also leads to some creative talent being driven away.

Rigid plans and improvisation are just different ways of storytelling. There is no ""right"" or ""wrong"" way to do it. And naturally, they have differing strengths and weaknesses.

And the thing is, most film series aren't written with solid plans.

Back to the future and Breaking Bad were never planned, and that didn't stop anyone from loving the hell out of those.

If the series isn't liked, then it's because of what the story is. Not the logistics of writing, level of care, or professionalism of those involved in making it.

Good creative people can make stories we don't like, even if they have absolute control.

When someone says they don't like a film because there wasn't a plan, they are handing an excuse to the film as to why it doesn't work for them that is *not* a valid industry excuse for it being bad. There are *multiple* examples of poorly planned situations that produced films that people enjoyed.

Hell, even within this franchise there are. Even recently. Solo, Rogue One. Both had plans that went entirely sideways to the point of effectively having *no* plan (and let's not forget the OT), and it's not like the ST didn't have *any* plan. Adam Driver has stated that he's known Kylo's arc ever since 7, and Pablo Hidalgo has made [these interesting comments about Rey Skywalker](https://comicbook.com/starwars/news/star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker-rey-identity-last-name-emperor-palpatine/) back in 2014. There was a 'plan' to some degree. It was written in pencil though. Meaning: it was flexible and could be molded whichever direction came naturally from one step to the next (which is why KK gave creative control to RJ and fired Trevorrow due to *creative differences*). It was only as definite as it needed to be. That makes perfect sense.

A good writer should know when to adjust the plan, when to revise it and when to throw it out completely and improvise (or improvise from the beginning if that's the desired approach).

TL;DR: people not liking the final product is totally fine. List what's in them that you didn't like all you want - the acting, the writing, the camera work, the editing, inconsistencies etc...whatever.

But don't give *any* film an excuse to be crippled by citing a lack of hard planning.",StarWars,ShambolicClown,False,/r/StarWars/comments/i4t8xx/the_sequel_trilogy_and_planning/

85,One issue with TCW Framed Ahsoka arc.,1596720561,"Firstly, I loved this arc, so please don't hate this post. I am simply pointing out a flaw. 

In the Framed Ahsoka story arc, well, the arc name is self-explanatory. For those who haven't seen it, I highly recommend it. Either way, there are spoilers ahead. 

At the beginning of the arc, Ahsoka is talking to the suspected bomber of the Jedi Temple. While this is happening, a hidden assailant force chokes the bomber. Ahsoka freaks out, as one would, and raises her hands. Later, Tarkin shows her the holo footage, and because of her raised arms, he thinks she choked the bomber. With the way the Jedi Council reacted, one would assume they saw the hologram and also came to that conclusion. Here lies the problem.

 1. Jedi have been shown to connect with holograms in some form or another. This is shown in the Lego comedy/adventure The Freemaker Adventures and the Star Wars animated T.V. show Rebels, with Rowan and Ezra respectively. So, the Jedi should have been able to connect to the hologram and sense Ahsoka's own fear. However, that could be impossible, so I'll move on. 

2. The way she raised her arms isn't the way a force user usually uses the force choke ability. Usually, it's with one hand, and the hand is curved as if their hand were actually placed around their victim's neck. And the perpetrator usually doesn't crouch while doing it.

However, Ahsoka is using two hands, her hands are relatively idle, and not making any particular shape that could be used to force choke. She is also slightly crouching, which seems minor, but a Jedi with good observational abilities could easily recognize this as a sign of fear. 

With these ideas, I feel like there are two possibilities: 

1. The Jedi didn't actually see the hologram. (Unlikely.)

2. The Jedi didn't realize any of the aforementioned things, and went along with the idea that she did in fact force choke the bomber. 

Any ideas?",StarWars,MikeofK72,False,/r/StarWars/comments/i4rtg0/one_issue_with_tcw_framed_ahsoka_arc/

Anakin was flying to the Senate building, fuming. He wanted to destroy the Chancellor, *to kill* him.

‚Äì ‚ÄúThe Jedi are too cowardly for this anyway‚Äù. ‚Äì ‚ÄúI will do this job by myself, if needed‚Äù.

Right now, Anakin‚Äôs head was clear. Nothing was distracting him. He was determent to finish the pan he had.

\- - -

Anakin reached the Senate building and got out of his speeder. When greeted by an alien receptionist at the desk, Anakin forced a smile out of himself, and after confirming that The Chancellor is here, went to his office.

\- - -

Chancellor Palpatine was indeed surprised by his friend‚Äôs unexpected visit.

‚Äì ‚ÄúHello Anakin‚Äù. ‚Äì Palpatine greeted him with a fake pitiful look. ‚Äì ‚ÄúI know about Padme‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sorry for that horrible news. Is she alright?‚Äù

Anakin forced himself to swallow his burning anger. It was too early for Palpatine to know.

‚Äì ‚ÄúYes. She is at home, getting better‚Äù. ‚Äì Anakin replied with a sad face.

‚Äì ‚ÄúThis is going out of hand‚Äù. ‚Äì Palpatine said. ‚Äì ‚ÄúThe Jedi are no longer protect the Republic and we need to think about what to do next‚Äù.

‚Äì ‚ÄúCalm, calm, calm‚Äù. ‚Äì Anakin was taking beep breaths to relax, but all he was thinking about was the realization of who Palpatine was. ‚Äì ‚ÄúSo, *this* was your plan all along you bastard?! Turn me against the Jedi?! Well congrats, you succeeded‚Äù. ‚Äì Anakin was thinking.

&amp;#x200B;

‚Äì ‚ÄúIs everything alright Anakin?‚Äù ‚Äì Palpatine sensed something from him. ‚Äì ‚ÄúI feel your anger‚Äù.

‚Äì ‚ÄúThis anger is for *you* bastard!‚Äù ‚Äì Anakin thought, but instead said something different:

‚Äì ‚ÄúI came here to say that I was **expelled from the Jedi Order**‚Äù.

Palpatine‚Äôs eyes wided.

‚Äì ‚ÄúWhat?!‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

Palpatine was forced to turn away to hide the exactment. His plan that he carried on for two decades is finally coming to action.

‚Äì ‚ÄúFinally! Finally, Anakin Skywalker belongs to *me*. Now, he hates the Jedi like no other. He is crushed, *destroyed* inside‚Äù.

Palpatine, in a sickly-sweet tone turned back to Anakin.

&amp;#x200B;

‚Äì ‚ÄúI‚Äôm‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm so sorry, my friend. I never knew they were capable of this‚Äù.

Now, Palpatine decide to take care of the iron while it was hot and immediately jumped straight to the point.

‚Äì ‚ÄúAnakin‚Äù. ‚Äì Palpatine continued. ‚Äì ‚ÄúDo you remember what I was telling you about the *Dark Side*?‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

Anakin suddenly felt that he was listening to Palpatine. Something was happening‚Ä¶ *Against his will*.

‚Äì ‚ÄúThe Light Side is a lie‚Äù. ‚Äì Said Palpatine with a hypnotizing voice. ‚Äì ‚ÄúThe so-called Light Side followers are now corrupted and fell into darkness. The Jedi are no longer protect the Galaxy ‚Äì they destroy it‚Äù.

&amp;#x200B;

‚Äì ‚Äú**What is happening?!**‚Äù ‚Äì Anakin was now terrified. ‚Äì ‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt I make this turd shut up?!‚Äù

‚Äì ‚ÄúYou were rejected by the Light. But now, you have a new opportunity‚Ä¶ For much more power. *On the Dark Side*‚Äù.

‚Äì ‚ÄúFight Anakin, **fight**‚Äù. ‚Äì Anakin was telling himself, while he felt more and more listening to Palpatine and more and more he wanted it.

When Palpatine was saying all this, Anakin noticed how his usually nice smile transformed into a blank and terrifying grin.

‚Äì ‚ÄúWell Anakin? What do you say?‚Äù ‚Äì Palpatine said with hollow eyes.

Anakin realized, what a trap he fell in. Now, he felt like he had no other choice than to say yes. Or maybe say no and fight?...

\- - -

But before Anakin could process his thoughts, the doors suddenly swung opened. It was Mace Windu and his little group of the Jedi Masters.

Palpatine looked at Mace Windu with a death glare. Anakin snapped out of Palpatine‚Äôs words and begun to immediately regain consciousness.

‚Äì ‚ÄúSupreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine, you are arrested for the treason against the Republic‚Äù.

Palpatine was shocked, but looked calm.

‚Äì ‚ÄúWho gave you the right to arrest me?‚Äù. ‚Äì Palpatine said.

‚Äì ‚ÄúThe Jedi Council. We know who you are *Darth Sidious*, it‚Äôs pointless to resist arrest‚Äù. ‚Äì Said Kit Fisto.

‚Äì ‚Äú*My arrest* is a treason against the Republic‚Äù. ‚Äì Palpatine said and looked over at Anakin.

Windu suddenly noticed Anakin and gasped.

‚Äì ‚Äú*Skywalker?!* *No*‚Äù ‚Ä¶

Windu bit his tongue. *What if Anakin is already brainwashed and now serving the Chancellor*?

‚Äì ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt resist Chancellor. Get up and hands behind‚Äù. ‚Äì Agen Kolar ordered, but Palpatine stayed where he was.

‚Äì ‚ÄúSo, you are telling me that the Jedi ordered you to arrest the highest politician?‚Äù ‚Äì Palpatine said, grinning. ‚Äì ‚ÄúWhat did the Republic come to. The Jedi are doing whatever they please‚Äù.

&amp;#x200B;

‚Äì ‚ÄúYour trial is going to be held soon‚Äù. ‚Äì Mace ordered, and Palpatine suddenly stood up. ‚Äì ‚ÄúThe senate is going to decide your fate‚Äù.

Palpatine grinned even more, it looked like he is holding himself from laughing.

‚Äì ‚ÄúSenate?‚Äù ‚Äì ‚Äú*I am* the Senate. I have absolute control over it. Each Senator is under *my* control and serves *me*, not the Republic‚Äù.

Windu cut Palpatine off.

&amp;#x200B;

‚Äì ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care who you are‚Äù. ‚Äì He said strictly. ‚Äì ‚ÄúMaster Kolar, Master Kcaj ‚Äì arrest the Chancellor Palpatine and the *citizen* Anakin Skywalker for suspected complicity with the Sith Lord‚Äôs plan. And take away his lightsaber‚Äù.

Anakin‚Äôs eyes wided. He was shocked. How could Windu think like this about him? Did his trust is really **that** little?!

Anakin wasn‚Äôt even trying to argue at this point. First, to not blow his cover and second, he knew, that Mace Windu always hated him and especially now, would jump at any opportunity to mess Anakin up.

&amp;#x200B;

But when Master Fisto put handcuffs on both Palpatine and Anakin, suddenly, Anakin heard Palpatine‚Äôs voice inside his head:

‚Äì ‚ÄúSee Anakin‚Ä¶ The Jedi had turned on you‚Ä¶ No one is trusting you now. They, without any proof accused you and now, you probably will rot in prison. But the Dark Side can save you. And I show you all power of it now‚Äù.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, Anakin caught himself **truly** wanting to join the Dark Side. After all, the Jedi betrayed him. And Palpatine stayed.

Suddenly, the handcuffs fell off both Palpatine and Anakin. Palpatine took his red lightsaber and drew it on the Masters.

‚Äì ‚ÄúIf you think you can arrest me, Master Windu, then it‚Äôs a treason‚Äù.

&amp;#x200B;

And Palpatine jumped to attack the Masters. But suddenly, Anakin drew his lightsaber on him, blocking the attack.

Palpatine turned and saw Anakin, on whose face was a mix of suffering, confusion and anger. His eyes wided.

‚Äì ‚ÄúAnakin‚Äù‚Ä¶ ‚Äì Was all Palpatine could say, before Anakin stroke him and the other Masters joined. But Palpatine, with an easy wave of hand  threw the Masters away, knocking them down with the Force, and turned to Anakin.

&amp;#x200B;

Anakin drew his lightsaber and looked ready to fight. What Palpatine never expected, is Anakin turning on him.

‚Äì ‚ÄúEven you betrayed me, Anakin‚Äù.

‚Äì ‚ÄúI was never on your side to begin with, bastard‚Äù. ‚Äì Anakin said angrily. ‚Äì ‚ÄúI knew who you are when I got there. I knew it was *you*, who ordered my wife being killed.  And I came here planning to kill you‚Äù.

&amp;#x200B;

Palpatine was shocked and disappointed. All those plans and the waiting was for nothing‚Ä¶ Suddenly, Palpatine felt a strange emotion which he didn‚Äôt feel for a very long time ‚Äì *anger*.

‚Äì ‚ÄúIf you are choosing to go this path, then our paths diverge‚Äù. ‚Äì Palpatine said and stroke a Force lightning at Anakin. He screamed of pain.

&amp;#x200B;

‚Äì ‚ÄúYou could have become the greatest Sith ever, but now, you are just going to die here, *my friend*‚Äù.

&amp;#x200B;

Palpatine felt Master Kcaj who got up, jumped to attack him, and immediately slashed the Jedi in a half with his lightsaber.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, after a pretty short battle, Kit Fisto and Agen Kolar were killed too. Only Mace Windu was the one who was left.

At this point, Anakin was exhausted and with each Force lightning stroke, his strength was leaving him.

Mace Windu was standing across from Palpatine, looking absolutely destroyed. It looked like he would cry with any minute.

Palpatine stroke the Force lightning again, now at Windu. He could barely reflect those lightings, but partly succeeded. Palpatine stopped sending them immediately after this and instead, send new ones on Anakin, as he begun standing up.

Palpatine prepared to strike Windu with his lightsaber again, but suddenly, was lifted and thrown to the wall.

\- - -

Anakin got his head up, and to his horror, saw **his kids,** who were standing on a speeder.

Luke jumped of the speeder and cut the window with his small lightsaber. Mace Windu saw him and rushed to Luke, but he sneaked near him.

Palpatine regained coconsciousness almost immediately and saw Luke, who was standing with a turned-on lightsaber.

Palpatine saw Windu behind Luke, and not paying any attention to Luke jumped straight to Windu, slashing Luke‚Äôs face a little in the process. Luke fell on the floor screaming. Anakin reached out his hand, but it fell. Meanwhile, Palpatine, using the fact that Windu was distracted, cut off his whole arm.

&amp;#x200B;

‚Äì ‚Äú**LUKE!**‚Äù ‚Äì Leia screamed and jumped into the room. She ran to her brother to help him get up. Palpatine ignored her, because he was too occupied dealing with Windu.

&amp;#x200B;

Windu was laying on the floor, helpless. Palpatine was slowly heading towards Windu to finally kill him. Windu breathed in and turned his head to Anakin.

‚Äì ‚ÄúSkywalker‚Ä¶ You were right‚Ä¶ My arrogance killed the Jedi around me‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sorry for doubting you‚Äù ‚Ä¶ ‚Äì Windu said his final words. He wasn‚Äôt even trying to fight at this point. It was clear that his fate is how decided.

Palpatine reached Windu and stabbed him right into his heart.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, Palpatine striked a lightning to Anakin and turned to Leia. She got her brother up and prepared to leave. *Sadly, she wasn‚Äôt fast enough*.

Palpatine lifted Leia up and started chocking. Little girl was trembling, trying to break free. She even tried using the Force, but it was laughable. She had no chance against the Sith Lord.

&amp;#x200B;

‚Äì ‚ÄúD-Daddy‚Ä¶ Help‚Äù ‚Ä¶ ‚Äì Leia could barely say. Palpatine was enjoying her suffering. He was smiling sadistically, while torturing a small child.

&amp;#x200B;

Anakin looked at this, full of rage. Now, it reached beyong human control. Anakin didn‚Äôt feel himself anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

‚Äì ‚Äú*Let her go you bastard!*‚Äù ‚Äì ‚Äú**LET.HER.GO!!!**‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

Anakin overpowered himself, got up and with a horrible and uncontrollable Force slammed Palpatine into a wall. Leia feel on the floor, Luke grabbed her, and dragged her away.

&amp;#x200B;

Palpatine realized what happened and immediately threw his most powerful Force lightning at Anakin. But Anakin blocked the lightning with his lightsaber and threw it back at Palpatine. He stopped sending it, but Anakin didn‚Äôt. *He had gone fully on rampage*.

Palpatine tried to attack him with his lightsaber, but suddenly, Anakin reached his hand and a ***Force lightning*** let out of it.

Anakin‚Äôs eyes turned from blue to bright yellow, and he was screaming, while sending those lightings at Palpatine. Pieces of his robes were destroyed from too much voltrage.

The lightnings, when reached Palpatine, were deforming his face to that point that it was unrecognizable. Now, it was Palpatine, who was screaming from pain.

‚Äì ‚Äú*I would never fall on the Dark Side!*‚Äù ‚Äì ‚Äú*I would not become anyone‚Äôs* **SLAVE** *anymore!!!*‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

Palpatine was barely moving now. His face was deformed and he looked scared. Scared of Anakin‚Äôs power.

And before Anakin could finish him of, he broke the rest of the window and fell out of it.

&amp;#x200B;

Anakin swallowed up in grief looking at the window, and immediately rushed to his children.

&amp;#x200B;

‚Äì ‚ÄúLeia!‚Äù ‚Äì Anakin worryingly took his daughter from Luke‚Äôs arms. ‚Äì ‚ÄúLeia, sweetheart, can you hear me?‚Äù

*Leia wasn‚Äôt responding*.

‚Äì ‚ÄúSweetie? ‚Äì Anakin asked once more. No response. A huge tear steamed down Luke‚Äôs face.

Anakin shook Leia a bit and she started coughing. Anakin took her by the hand. Luke stopped crying.

‚Äì ‚ÄúDaddy‚Äù‚Ä¶ ‚Äì Leia smiled lightly and took her father by the check. Anakin cried and hugged both Luke and Leia. Luke and Leia hugged him back. They all begun to cry, both from unbearable pain and from happiness that they are all alive.

It looks like Rogue One Vader. I could only imagine if what the people who made this could do with a Disney budget.

52,The Rule of Two,1596656588,"The Sith Rule of Two is always stated by the Jedi to be a hard and fast thing. Specifically stated in The Phantom Menace (among other places) is that ‚ÄúAlways two there are, a master and an apprentice.‚Äù But starting with Count Dooku, it seems that Sidious/Palpatine isn‚Äôt overly concerned with the rule. After Maul was presumed dead, he recruited Dooku, who must have been on the dark side path already as none of the Jedi seem shocked by his defection. But then Dooku has his own apprentices. First Asajj Ventress, then Maul‚Äôs brother Savage Opress. Sure, he labels them as assassins, but he clearly and openly trains them in the ways of the Dark Side, equips them with lightsabers, and sends them out to do his bidding as he does Sidious‚Äô. 

Then of course Maul isn‚Äôt actually dead and rejoins his brother after the failed attempt on Dooku‚Äôs life. And so yet another Master and Apprentice team are around, albeit short lived. All this while Palpatine is actively trying to subvert Anakin Skywalker, his endgame choice of apprentice.

Not even touching on the Inquistors, cause they are clear Dark Side sympathizers/allies.

So I guess I‚Äôm wondering if The Rule of Two is misunderstood by the Jedi, or if Sidious/Palpatine is skirting the rule by labeling Dooku‚Äôs people as assassins. Or perhaps, in his master plan, he believes he has the Jedi so snowed over that the Rule of Two need no longer apply?",StarWars,JHunter1986,False,/r/StarWars/comments/i4cakm/the_rule_of_two/

So even through there was something beautiful in the archtypical ceremony of the Princess awarding the hero Luke the medal, it's not about awards. And a Jedi ought not to care for possessions, right?

It took me long to realize that Luke winning the battle of Yavin had much to do with Luke's belief in the Force, and Luke still struggled with belief as shown with Yoda.

2,Why is it that it's mostly PT fans that dislike the Sequels?,1596641741,"I have a feeling I'm gonna get many downvotes for this..

So I grew up with both trilogies, I was born in 2000 and saw Revenge of the Sith in Cinema. I enjoyed the prequels but overall prefer the original trilogy.
When the prequel trilogy came out a lot of PT fans got hate from OT fans but it feels like the same is happening to the ST fans from the PT fans.
My Dad grew up with the OT and doesn't mind the prequels, there's a lot he likes and a lot he dislikes, but he really enjoyed the new trilogy as it felt more like the OT and he thinks they are generally better films. 
I've noticed this trend a lot. Many people I know who grew up with the OT have really enjoyed the new trilogy and spin off films.
On the other hand I've noticed that a lot of people like me who saw the prequels at first and when they were in cinema are the ones that dislike the new trilogy. I see so many people who adore Revenge of the Sith and hate the new films.
In my opinion Revenge of the Sith is a great film but ultimately I prefer the new trilogy. But I've seen that a lot of the sequel haters tend to be people who grew up with the prequel trilogy.
Is this just the cycle of fandom? Why does this tend to be the case? And do you reckon the new generation who grew up with the sequels will dislike the next trilogy just as many prequel fans dislike the new trilogy?",StarWars,Ga1acticSquirel,False,/r/StarWars/comments/i47ic8/why_is_it_that_its_mostly_pt_fans_that_dislike/

Guinness sadly famously hated working on A New Hope and was bitter that their most famous role had been in such a movie, instead of their other successes like 1957's ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" and didn't enjoy the attention it brought him, but has also, at one point, praised the immersiveness of ANH, calling it ""invigorating"".

A relatively important plot point in ROTS is when Palpatine requests Anakin to represent him on the Jedi Council and Ani is overwhelmed with pride as he believes that will make him a Master.  Then when he meets with the Council they allow him to join but deny him Master status which helps drive the narrative of Anakin's resentment towards the Jedi Order.  

Then you have the beginning of Clone Wars and Ahsoka being assigned not to Master Kenobi but to MASTER Anakin.

23,The Last Jedi is the best star wars film since The Empire Strikes Back,1596586091,"I understand the complaints about episode VIII. I really do. The Leia scene is infamous for good reason, the comedy was a little off beat in a bad way. And all in all, it might not be as tightly paced as its predecessors.

But when taking all of these new Star Wars films as a whole (including the spin-off's), The Last Jedi is absolutely the only one that did ANYTHING new.

The Force Awakens is utterly unoriginal. Abrams basically remade a New Hope and swapped out some characters. Even the mentor figure introduced to our new leads is killed in a Death Star-style space station. For crying out loud: it starts off on a desert planet and with a lead character whose main motivation is ""getting off this rock."" It's just a recap. It might have felt like Star Wars, but it was nothing but fan service and safe filmmaking.

Then Rian Johnson comes along. For the record - he's no Abrams when it comes to piecing together a fast-paced SciFi film. But his writing is far and away the best the series has had since Empire Strikes Back. He expands upon and introduces new concepts with the Force (something that happened in the OT routinely). He introduces aspects of the SW universe that have never been explained before, like how Rebels and Imperials alike are financed and exactly how put-upon poorer citizens of the Galaxy are. And for the first time, gray area exists in Star Wars where before, there were only two things you could be: good, or bad. Even Han Solo, the most morally ambiguous character in the OT, could never be called anything but a ""good guy.""

Then there is the wonderful subversion of fan expectations at almost every plot development. Rey flirting with the dark side, Kylo cutting down Snoke, an Alliance cruiser smashing through a Super Star Destroyer at lightspeed. The fact that the entire film is a contained chase scene, employing a structure never seen in a Star Wars film before. Even Luke's arc, his attitudes about the force and training Rey, are contrary to what fans want and expect from Star Wars. And Johnson's refusal to reveal some huge, epic backstory for Rey, when everyone expected one, was delightfully surprising and realistic.

Subversion of expectations, for the record, should be WHY we enjoy watching new films. If you want the same thing over and over again, just keep watching the same movies.

All in all, I just really feel like Star Wars fans were not fair with Rian Johnson. Was it the best-made film of the year? No, but Star Wars seldom is. Did it deliver on every fan theory and expectation of blatant fan-service? No, but good films don't do that.

These are just some of the reasons why I believe, in 10-15 years' time, the Last Jedi will be the only new-era Star Wars film that stands up to scrutiny.",StarWars,fret3tr,False,/r/StarWars/comments/i3uye2/the_last_jedi_is_the_best_star_wars_film_since/

30,Is Kylo Ren related to Anakin?,1596583056,"The reason I'm asking is because there's a lot of similarities between the two. ROTS Anakin actually looks quite similar to Kylo.

Kylo also keeps Vader's helmet as a relic so I'm assuming it was given to him as a sort of family heirloom.

I know people will say he's the son of Leia so of course he's related, but the films strongly hint that Kylo is the son of Han and someone he had an affair with, hence the separation between Leia and Han. Also Kylo looks nothing like Leia. Leia was duped into believing it was her son. Is it possible Anakin had another daughter we don't know about that Han had a child with? Perhaps Padme had triplets? The birthing scenes cut away a lot in ROTS and I swear I hear a third baby cry. Perhaps another child was birthed off screen. Two of my friends agree.

I‚Äôm watching the Disney+ Gallery docuseries for The Mandalorian, and the second episode (‚ÄúLegacy‚Äù) focuses on the impact of Star Wars and why it‚Äôs stayed as relevant/popular as it has for 40+ years. Towards the end of the episode, Dave Filoni gives an amazing monologue explaining the theme of fatherhood that runs through Episodes 1-6, and why Maul‚Äôs duel with Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon in TFM is the most important lightsaber duel in the Skywalker Saga. He perfectly explains the cascading effect of that duel‚Äôs outcome and how it set the stage for the tragedy of Anakin Skywalker, and how it creates this unifying theme that connects the first 6 episodes. His explanation is so beautifully simple yet eloquent I don‚Äôt dare attempt to break it down here, because I wouldn‚Äôt do it justice, so everyone on this sub should go and watch it. To me, it‚Äôs moments like these that Filoni‚Äôs truly holistic understanding of Star Wars is so apparent, and it‚Äôs wonderful knowing that someone like him has that job.

It attracts the galaxies' attention and the Hutt Clan gain considerably more earnings to increase their criminal activities in the Outer Rim, while Chancellor Valorum dresses expensively and causes more Opera's to be built, people to care about fashion (etc. etc.), more people arrive on Coruscant than ever before and the Jedi and Republic seem useless against the Outer Rim problems. (Those that will later be allied with the CIS begin to hate the Republic now). Palpatine causes additional corruption in the Senate, by using Force Suggestion, political maneuvering, bribery, and assassination. **It was the Sith, it was all the Sith, it was only the Sith.**

Maul at the age of 1 was brought to a banking clan (Damask Holdings Outpost) on Mustafar where he would be cared for during his early development. Remember during the Clone Wars? Anakin and Ahsoka infiltrate a Mustafar base, where force-sensitive children had been kidnapped and taken to be experimented on by 2 nursing droids? One of them might have taken care of Maul.

(Maul's mother used to be just a random Dathomirian female, who did not want her 2 sons (Savage...) to fall to Night Brother slavery, but could only save 1 and was afraid of Mother Talzin. Now it has changed to: Sidious wanted Talzin as his apprentice, but stole Maul away from her, because he saw more potential in him.)",StarWars,VictorV1000,False,/r/StarWars/comments/i3saoc/the_darth_plagueis_novel_reveals_so_much/

The villains seem incompetent, it‚Äôs like they‚Äôre so dumb they fall for anything the Rebels throw at them and I just can‚Äôt be intimidated by them anymore in this show.

96,It's been awhile since we had a Star Wars movie so I wrote my own story plot for the 7th movie.,1596547158,"I'm not really a writer at all but I hope yall enjoy it:

Following the defeat of Darth Sidious, The Empire has fallen into chaos. Formal imperial commanders fight for regional power. Meanwhile, the rebels continue to fight for oppressed planets.

Our story begins 20 years later. Rey has just been granted the rank of jedi knight by Master Luke. Her first mission as a lone jedi is to help the Rebels fend off the invasion on Jakku.

The First Order, led by Lord Phasma, has broken off from main body of The Empire. They have taken control of a dozen planets in the region and are now targeting Jakku. Rumours of their conquest on previous planets were horrific. Some refugees tell tales of genocide, torture, and slavery.

The Rebels are late to arrive. The invasion has already started. The First Order troops march into the main city, razing buildings and homes. Stormtroopers flanked the entire city, herding the inhabitants into a corner. Locals tried to run but were deterred by flamethrowers and nets.

We are acquainted with a young Jakkuan boy, Kylo, who is hiding in an alley with his parents. His father is frantically trying to pry open the sewer entrance, but it is no use, stormtroopers find them and herd them into the town square.

The stormtroopers begin funneling the locals into cages and holding areas to control the crowd. Men are being separated from the women and children. Two of the stormtroopers come over to grab Kylo's parents, dragging them away. The stormtrooper shoves the mother while making a sexual remark. Enraged, the father lashed out, tackling the stormtrooper, knocking off his helmet and beating him with his bare fists. He got in a few strikes to the face before other troopers came to disarm him. The beaten trooper, with his broken pride, knew he had to make a statement. So he flamethrowers the two parents, burning them alive right in front of Kylo.

Shortly after, Rey leads a small advanced party to disrupt The First Order. They punch a hole in the imperial defense and are able to save dozens of locals. The party gunned down two squadrons of  stormtroopers and disabled a dozen cargoships. However, they knew they had to retreat as their small numbers couldn't deal with more reinforcements. As Rey rounds up the flank and prepares to retreat, she notices Kylo sitting in an open cage, motionless and with a stunned look on his face. Rey had no time for questions, so she dragged him onto rebel gunship. They regrouped at a rebel encampment on the other side of the planet.

Back at base camp, Rey went to check on Kylo. She had a strange feeling about him that she didn't quite understand. Kylo was no older than 15 and suffered minor burns to his forearms. There were still streaks of mud and tears down his cheeks. Rey attempts to force heal Kylo's wounds while he tells her about the traumatic death of his parents.

Rey then goes on to scheme the next assault with the rebels. They locate the expected holding area for the rest of the locals. The plan is to recapture the city and free the locals, then take up defensive positions.

The next day, the rebels mobilise most of their forces to surround the city. The rebels shot down the troopers with ease, but Rey could sense that something wasn't right. They occupied the city without much resistance and closed in on the halls that were holding the citizens. They were empty. The locals must have already been smuggled onto the First Order's flagship. Fearing the worst, Rey yelled at everyone to evacuate, but it was too late. Bombs detonated throughout the city, killing half of the rebel forces.

Meanwhile, Kylo was back at base camp, alone in his room. The memories and flashbacks kept playing in his head. He could still feel the heat of the flames. He started hearing voices in his head. Dark sinister voices that made him even more afraid. Suddenly, gunshots shattered the tranquil night. The First Order, had predicted the rebel plans all along. They conquered the vulnerable encampment, enslaving the remaining locals and leaving ashes in their wake.

Rey and the rebel survivors return to the base camp to find it smoldering.   Lord Phasma makes contact. She demands that the rebels leave the star system or they risk the lives of the remaining locals. Beaten and cornered, the rebels are ready to give up. Rey reflects on the situation and finally stands up to talk. She follows Luke and Leia's teachings to garner enough hope for the rebels to continue. Rey was concerned for the people of Jakku. But in particular, she was worried for Kylo. She could sense something odd about him. Maybe he was force sensitive. Anyhow, Rey felt responsible for him now that he was an orphan.

A new plan is hatched. It was risky but the circumstance wouldn't allow for anything else. Rey mounted her lone stealth fighter and flew straight for the flagship. Infiltrating the flagship undetected was easy for such a small spacecraft. Rey planted detonators on the power generators. She then headed for the control room. Once inside, she put the ship on lockdown, closing all the hallway doors. Next, she detonated the charges, cutting off the power supply. The lights went out and sirens started wailing. Rey sent the signal for the rebel fleet to engage, then hurried off to find the hostages.

Kylo is hunched over in his holding cell. He is still deep in thougt, mulling over the events. Each time he envisions his parents faces, his heartache worsens. This smell of burning flesh is emblazoned into his mind. Each time he saw a stormtrooper walk by, his fear and hated grew. Directly opposite his cell was a cargo room. Troopers are moving plundered goods into the cargo room, snickering and laughing as they did. ""If we can sack Coruscant, then these outerworlds are free goodies"" they sneered, ""This stuff ain't as shiny though"". Just as the last words left the troopers' mouths, the halls went dark and the sirens roared. The laser gated jail cells ceased to restrain their captives. Chaos ensued, the hostages streamed out of the cells, some pounced onto stormtroopers, and some rushed down the hallways. Confused and afraid, Kylo dashed to the nearby cargo room to seek refuge.

While hiding in the cargo room, the voices in Kylo's head grew louder. It was hard to hear what they said. There were dozens or even hundreds of voices, some whispering, some booming with laughter. Kylo was on the verge of madness. All at once, the voices stopped and his attention was directed to a large silver box that was gleaming under the flashing red lights. He had an unexplainable urge to open it, his hands moving by themselves as he removed the cover. The box was filled with relics and treasures from Coruscant. On top of the pile, squarely in front of Kylo, was a single cylindrical object. A lightsaber.

Kylo hesitated for a moment. ""Take it"" commanded a sinister voice. The voice was clear and echoed in his head. Kylo reached out to grasp the weapon firmly in his palm. Dark energy pulsed from the lightsaber. Kylo was engulfed in a frenzy of hatred. He hated this cruel world. Why weren't his people strong enough to retaliate? How could such scum and villainy be left free to terrorise the masses? Kylo ignited the lightsaber and it glowed with a menacing sanguine hue. He charged into the hallways, hacking left and right at whatever dared move. Whether a trooper or a fellow Jakkuan, it didn't matter, Kylo was in a blind rage. He rampaged up and down several hallways, cutting through the steel lockdown doors. As Kylo turned a corner towards the bow of the ship, the fire in his eyes burned with even more intensity. The entrance to the commander's bridge was up ahead. It was time for Lord Phasma to pay.

Kylo bursts into the bridge, decapitating two troopers instantly. The others open fire, but Kylo's possessed body movements evaded everything. Bodies hit the floor one by one as Kylo closed in on the helpless Phasma. Rey enters the bridge just as Kylo deals the killing blow to Phasma. ""Kylo!"" she yells, shocked and dumbfounded. The last thing she expected was to find a sith-like Kylo murdering the entire crew. Kylo leaped over to her with his blade held high, exchanging blows and strikes. With a closer look, Rey could see that his face had turned a greyish colour and his eyes were a sickly yellow hue. ""Don't give in to the dark side!"" Rey yelled. They exchanged several more blows but Kylo's rage began to fade. He couldn't remember much of the past hour. His face returned to its natural colour. As he calmed down, he backed away, confused. Abruptly, he ran away back into the chaos of the ship's hallways. Rey wanted to follow but she needed to steer ship to prevent a crash.

After hours of battling, the Rebel fleet forced The First Order's warships to retreat, allowing them to secure the flagship. Most of the Jakkuan people have been saved but there is no sign of Kylo. He has run away in an escape pod. Jakku has been saved but Rey knows she failed her mission. The sith have re-emerged and she needs Master Luke's guidance. 

TLDR: Jedi knight Rey is tasked to help the Rebels save Jakku from imperial invasion. On the planet, she finds a boy, Kylo, who was orphaned in a traumatic incident. Kylo and other locals are captured and held hostage on The First Order's flagship. During the effort to free the captives, Kylo finds a sith lightsaber stowed away among treasures plundered from Coruscant. Fueled by his traumatic past, Kylo is possessed by the dark side and goes on a killing spree. Rey is able to calm him down. Jakku is saved, but Kylo has ran away in an escape pod.",StarWars,readredditrededit,False,/r/StarWars/comments/i3j5o8/its_been_awhile_since_we_had_a_star_wars_movie_so/

47,Why Rouge one works so well.,1596523426,"DISCLAIMERS: This is my first time writing anything like this so if it seems wordy, messy and all over the place I'm sorry about that.   
I also know this movie has its flaws like any other movie but this is just focusing on the good.   
I know there will be people who disagree with me on some of these and feel free to comment about it, just be civil when doing so, as well as responding to these comments, everyone is entitled to their own opinions   
I definitely missed a lot here since there's just so much to talk about, so feel free to bring anything up that you thought I should've added.  
Also when I say ""casual fans"" this is not attacking anyone in any way, some people aren't as into Star Wars as others so their knowledge on it could be limited to the movies and such.

Say what you want about Disney Star Wars but Rouge One is a good movie *and* a good Star Wars movie. First thing I love about it is how it tries to be different, TFA, TLJ and TROS all follow in the footsteps of the OT and prequels, which is fine, but the fact that they decided to take a bit of a risk with Rouge One deserves some respect. Not having the opening crawl was the first thing different from the other films people notice when watching, as much as I love the crawls I think throwing us into the movie with minimum knowledge and no context was a good idea, since the story is fairly simple to understand. It shows you everything throughout the film, why the Empire wanted Galen Erso and why he left, why Bodhi Rook is so persistent to talk to Saw Gerrera, and just so much more. I also love how they brought a character from The Clone Wars into the movie, so fans of TCW will appreciate the reference, but also keep his story to just the movie, letting people who're watching TCW for the first time be surprised and make the connection (me included).   
Another reason why its so different is because they strayed away from force users (besides Darth Vader. I wouldn't consider Chirrut a force user, but a force sensitive) it really shows us what its like for non force sensitives in the Star Wars universe. It also gives us the first live action version of Fortress Vader, something some more casual Star Wars fans might not even know about, and giving some fan service to those of us who do. It also shows us Vader inside of Bacta tank, another thing that some casual fans might not know is how he can take off his suit sometimes. The way Director Krennic stutters as Vader steps towards him shows us how much of an intimidating character Vader really is. This movie certainly is more of a serious movie than the others, they have some funny lines and moments (My favorite being ""Are you kidding me, I'm blind!). Some people would argue that this is a downside to the film, but I think the film taking a sort of darker tone, almost making it feel more like a drama at moments just shows us how much of a risk they took with this movie, which is a nice touch.   
K-2SO, when I first watched the movie I actually hated him, but after re watching a few times I just love how he's not perfect, he acts almost awkward sometimes, I think every Star Wars movie needs a good droid in the mix and K-2SO definitely fills that role. Chirrut is another unique character in this movie, the way he uses the force is different to most force sensitives we've seen in Star Wars, instead of a lightsaber he uses his staff and relies on the force to do so, which is something I just love about him.  
I think this movie filling in the space just before A New Hope works well, as well as fixing a plot hole, (or at least something I'd consider a plot hole) that being how such a big flaw such as the thermal exhaust port could go overlooked. But Rogue One fixes this plot hole in a way that makes sense. Something that's not a plot hole but his movie helps explain is why Leia's ship is already being pursued and attacked by a Star Destroyer, something minor but I think it adds so much to the beginning of ANH. Rogue One is a movie that wasn't necessarily needed but, it adds so much to these movies which is just another reason why it works so well.  
There's so much to say about the final act of this movie, firstly the shoretroopers were a nice touch (This not being their first appearance, that being in Star Wars: Commander) yet another thing some casual fans might not know about. The movie showing us AT-ATs walking through the water really shows us these things really are All Terrain, a bit of a minor detail but I think its a nice one. K-2SO's sacrifice was certainly a turning point in the movie, it puts Jyn and Cassian in such a sticky situation, only adding to the peril the attack already is in. Between the rebels being pinned down, and the battle above seeming to be unwinnable for the rebels, the rebels knew the assault wouldn't be in their favor, but they know if they can get the plans it'll be worth it in the end. Chirrut's death shortly after is when Baze really starts to believe in the force, he starts saying ""I am one with the force, and the force is with me"" knowing his friend will always be with him. The rebels using the Hammerhead corvette and Star Destroyer to take down the shield really shows us how they utilize everything and anything they can in the fight against the Empire. Director Krennic's death was well deserved, the fact that he dies to the very thing he helped create is just icing on the cake. I think the way that they handled Jyn and Cassian's relationship was pretty good, instead of having them fall in love or anything else, they decided to keep it as a friendship, they know they're doomed after the Death Star hits the planet, but they know they've won the day, as they wait to be killed by the blast. Killing off all the main characters isn't something you'd think to see in a Star Wars movie, but they went in that direction, yet another reason why this movie is so different and good.  And finally, one of the best scenes in the movie, the Darth Vader hallway scene, the scene that was almost not in the movie, the scene that was added during post production. This scene is one of the best things about this movie, the rebels are frantic and scared as they try and escape before Vader shows up, and when he does it just shows us how powerful he really is. Deflecting every blaster bolt that comes his way, throwing that rebel to the ceiling, using the force to push a bolt back at a rebel and pulling their weapons away. But if that wasn't enough they show us how truly ruthless he is when he strikes down *all* the unarmed rebels in the hallway. And just for one more badass moment, having Vader stand in the docking bay watching Leia's ship escape. Some people might say this was fan service, or just an excuse to have Vader do a badass scene, and they're absolutely right, but that doesn't take away from the fact that its one of the best scenes in the movie.  
One thing unrelated to the story is just how amazing this movie looks visually, all the locations are just so beautiful, the space battles are just amazing, and the Death Star itself is such a sight to see.

* \[UNICEF\]( [https://www.unicefusa.org/](https://www.unicefusa.org/) ) - UNICEF also saves children, but they're more focused on less fortunate countries and the problems that come with them. Their homepage, at the time of my writing this, mentions lead poisoning, human trafficking, and more.

Even if you like the direction they took story, Abrams and Johnson failed to harness the acting talent with some of the choices with the script.",1596503141,"Despite the fact that I generally don't like the sequel trilogy, I have to admit that the actiing talent was pretty good and I felt were able to deliver on a wide range of emotions in a convincing and compelling manner and had good chemistry with each other. I did however find that the script was often clunky or just misused their characters. I feel like the final movie in particular squandered the chemistry the actors had with each other the most with some of the squabbling drama which either could have been omitted or more artfully written. Also, I genuinely think that the actors would have delivered if given scripts with well written story arcs. Boyega and Isaac especially seem to have been very thoughtful in the way they approached their stories only to have many of their good ideas shot down by the directors according to the interviews I've seen with them. Despite the mouth open memes, I really think Ridley performed well despite  the script she had.

&amp;#x200B;

In my opinion, the Original trilogy had a great story and great actors, Prequels had a great story and good actors, but with some questionable choices in script and how they wanted the performance delivered, especially with Anakin. And finally the Sequels, had a poorly written story and clunky script but with near OT tier acting talent. It really is a shame.

93,"Extra-genre content (shows, movies, games)",1596485583,"Star Wars is and always was a sci-fi fantasy story. I may be going against the grain here, but I think it would be cool to have content outside of that category. I‚Äôll give a few examples:

- Workplace comedy about the crew of a Star Destroyer

- Horror game from Visceral about the Blackwing virus (from the Legends book Death Troopers) 

- A mature game from Rockstar

- Culinary/cultural exploration show, following a team around the galaxy to try different food and learn about cultures, ‚Äúthis week we‚Äôre trying fried X from a street vendor on Nar Shadda, and talking with him about his inspiration,‚Äù 

- Political thriller a la House of Cards, centered around the Senate in or around 20 BBY

- R-Rated war movie about the Empire attempting to take Jabiim, akin to Hacksaw Ridge or something like that

- Crime/espionage thriller following an ISB agent hunting a rebel nemesis

- I‚Äôd even be interested in seeing a romantic comedy on Coruscant, and I‚Äôm not even remotely in the demographic for that type of thing

To clarify, I‚Äôm not saying ‚Äúdarker = better,‚Äù it‚Äôs just that there‚Äôs a whole galaxy to work with, and so many different stories that could be told. Yes the franchise is technically for kids, that doesn‚Äôt mean we cannot have adult centered content. Imagine being a kid and growing up with the main trilogies, then once you‚Äôre old enough you can view/play the more mature movies and games. I think that would be interesting, and that there are opportunities here. I recognize that Disney likely won‚Äôt do any of these, I‚Äôm just expressing the belief that I think extra-genre content, outside of sci fi fantasy, could help build the galaxy and bring new perspectives about it to fans. The Mandalorian is a good example, it works very well as a Western in the SW galaxy. To me, this stuff would keep the franchise feeling fresh and the galaxy lived in. I‚Äôm not saying Star Wars shouldn‚Äôt have traditional sci fi fantasy stories anymore, just that there‚Äôs an opportunity to enrich the universe with stories that wouldn‚Äôt get told otherwise. The culinary show, for instance, would make the planets they go to feel more lived in IMO.

0,An uncomfortable truth. Hating on Sequels and Prequels isn't about Star Wars at all.,1596460176,"It's about aging. Yoda said 'truly wonderful the mind of a child is'. Part of what makes a child's mind so wonderful is that it hasn't experienced as much. It sees things as new because they are new to them, whether they are new or not. As a result of this, the reaction they have is more pronounced, and more indelibly etched into their minds. 

We all have our first memories of Star Wars. The initial wonder is part of the reason we're here now. Whether we saw it as younglings or not that first impression left an impression. Everything that came after that point somehow fails to capture that same wonder, no matter its quality.

So here is my suggestion: rather than focusing outward and blaming others for your lack of enjoyment, focus inward and acknowledge that you are not the same as you were when you first glimpsed a galaxy far, far way. You cannot feel that same thrill, nor should you expect to. Instead you can help usher others into our community, and help them feel that thrill. 

The Jedi Code says that: 'there is no death, there is the Force'. I use that as a reminder that the impact I have on people, and the memories I leave them with, is what matters. I want my kids to have a positive experience with Star Wars, that's not surrounded by whisperings of 'Oh that's the one with Jar Jar' or 'She's not a Skywalker' or whatever thing people come up with to complain about in the future. 

You can't get it back, it's not your turn, someone else is using the childhood wonder at the moment. So help them.",StarWars,Luckywithtime,False,/r/StarWars/comments/i2wqnh/an_uncomfortable_truth_hating_on_sequels_and/

4,Did First Order start loosing control on galaxy in TROS,1596459837," 

* When we know that First Order conquer galaxy in few weeks, in Tros the are really desperate, to make deal with Emperor and his fleet. I think it' beacause when the have enough forces to take over galaxy, they don't have enough resources to control everythink, so thats why the start kindaped children or take adults recruts like Tam
* ''Tie-ins such as the *Resistance* cartoon show rounded this out in more detail, but the First Order couldn't possibly hope to conquer the entire galaxy so quickly, in terms of a direct military occupation. They had the most powerful remaining fleet, which they used to basically just bully all the local planetary governments into following their orders - but outright *replacing* all the local governments and militaries would have been logistically impossible.
* The result was a tenuous position in which the First Order would lose if every system in the galaxy revolted against them at the same time. Ruthlessly crushing a few local revolts was enough to scare everyone else back into line for a while, but fundamentally, the First Order hierarchy was still scared that the Resistance would inspire a general revolt against them, by proving that they're just a junta of schoolyard bullies - IN SPACE! - who are still drastically outnumbered by the good people in the galaxy.""",StarWars,darthsheldoninkwizy,False,/r/StarWars/comments/i2wnjn/did_first_order_start_loosing_control_on_galaxy/

I‚Äôm not a hater, well yeah I am, of the sequels. I‚Äôll admit that after TFA I was as excited as I‚Äôve been over Star Wars in awhile but the last Jedi left such a sour taste in my mouth.

As a 40 year old I‚Äôve seen the highest highs and lowest lows for Star Wars and Xmas 2019 til now has to be the lowest point for the property I can remember. 

The prequels were not exactly received well but what a story Lucas managed to tell! So complex, almost too complex. 

The sequel garbage was so nostalgic it was disgusting and what‚Äôs worse is Disney top Lucas that‚Äôs what they wanted to do. ‚ÄúA movie for the fans‚Äù 

I‚Äôll admit episode 1 and 2 kind of sucked at the time. I can remember watching ROTS in the theaters and there is a scene on a ship with the white and black background similar to the OT and I said ‚Äúfinally some real Star Wars‚Äù so I can see Disney‚Äôs reasons for making the st the way they did. 

But if they are going for an mCU size interconnected set of films they totally missed the bus.

49,Discussion on why watching the original sequel first is better than watching in chronological order (ep1-6 only ),1596444307,"Prequels : 1 2 3

Sequels: 4 5 6 (excluding the disney franchise) 


Okay thats probably been discussed a lot already on this sub, but as the title asks, which would you prefer to watch and why? 

Didnt include 7 8 9 in the discussion because its not really for debate, you wouldnt go 4-9,123 would you? Lol

I come from the old school, so I watched 4 5 6 first (since the prequels werent made yet). Today I redid a chronological marathon with some friends who never watched star wars, and it got me thinking they won't have the same experience as me, and I'll explain what i mean by that below.

Watching 4 5 6 first made darth vador that big and huge villain almost invincible who could never be defeated, he has that big aura around him, so many mysteries about him, how is he Luke's father? How did he turn like that based on obiwan's stories?? Then watching the prequels, made me discover his story, how he turned into who he is, esp ep 3 which made the connection between everything because in 1 and 2 he looked like he had so much good into him that he couldn't turn bad. Esp, in ep 3 surely although you'd know it was bound to happen. Watching in chronological order wouldnt have that effect, you wouldnt have so much emotion so many anecdotes attached to it :when Obiwan or Yoda told luke his dad was a strong jedi and reminiscing about him, or when Obiwan fought Vador on the death star or Vador saying he felt a presence he hasnt felt in a long time. Watching that scene first before the prequels make for a lot of easter eggs or emotions onto it. Especially the LUKE I AM YOUR FATHER scene, it was a big reveal that had this effect because we didnt know he was his father, watching chronologically we'd have seen padme give birth to him, and lose that moment. 

My 2nd pt is Palpatine, when watching the prequels i was eager to find out who he actually is (always thought it was the Chancellor Sheev, but wasn't sure as his face was barely seen/shown in the prequels, and by the sequels his face was disfigured, and thats also what made me wonder if thats actually Sheev or how his face became disformed). Again, watching in chronological order, youd find out soon enough who is Palpatine.

3rd pt, i think watching the sequels first, then having to wait for prequels to be made also added to some magic/mystic to it? Compared to nowadays when you can just binge everything in a click. Also, some references they do in the prequels brings back the nostalgia of the sequels which again wouldnt work if watching in chronological order (although this pt is more abt the time difference between the sequels and prequels) 

4th little background story about Boba Fett, how he became who he is after seeing his father die to a Jedi. 

Any thoughts? I understand the common idea is to watch in chronological order, i mean why wouldn't you? Thats how Lucas meant it to be anyway. I was wondering maybe I'm being biased in my assessment? Maybe there are some advs to watching the prequels first that I'm not seeing? Maybe some anecdotes /mysteries that only watching in chronological order would be more poignant?

53,"Truly wonderful, the mind of a child is... (Long)",1596440419,"One of my favorite sayings from Master Yoda has proven itself true to me in a huge way recently, and I felt like sharing my experience with you all in the hopes that it makes someone smile.

Since life began grinding to a halt earlier this year, like many I have had a lot more ""free"" time to spend on leisure / entertainment. It's been a joy using much of this time to watch series and films I've always wanted to see and of course to re-watch the stuff that is important to me that I probably never would have had time to revisit otherwise. My favorite drama series, fantasy and sci-fi shows, you name it.

I've used a huge portion of this time to introduce my children to Star Wars, and to guide them through the Film and TV canon (albeit in a bizarre order) and truly experience it in its entirety \*with\* them. Oh man, it has been \*so\* incredibly fulfilling. Seeing the reactions of your own kids to the characters, plot lines, and famous ""moments"" that you've obsessed over since \*you\* were their age is just an indescribable parenting experience. 

Allow me to describe for you what was the ultimate culminating moment of the experience for me.

So as I mentioned, I've spent a significant amount of time with my kids watching (almost) all of the canon. In recent weeks they've gone through, and absolutely adored, The Clone Wars. For the record, they rank Rebels on the same level as TCW, maybe even a touch higher. We did watch Rebels first, however. Like I said, bizarre order. But due to their ages I thought this was the best introduction.

All that to say, these kids absolutely fell in love with Clone Wars era Anakin, Obi-Wan, Ahsoka and so on. They had seen ANH and ESB before watching the cartoons, and once they got used to it they loved seeing characters like ""Old Obi-Wan"" and how he was different from ""Clone Wars Obi-Wan."" Or how ""Boy Anakin"" was different from ""Padawan Anakin"" who was well... Darth Vader! (Episode III was a tough pill for them to swallow, they weren't allowed to see the truly graphic bits though.)

Well, we finished TCW and I told them it was finally time for us to watch Return of the Jedi and see the ending of the story of Luke/Leia/Han and Vader/Palpatine. They were already expressing how excited they were to watch the ""Rey Movies,"" so in a weird way I almost took RotJ for granted a bit. Obviously I know the story like the back of my hand, and I knew they were hyped for the new stuff.

Then we screened RotJ, and before long some memories were formed that will no doubt be ones I carry forward the rest of my life (saying this as someone with legitimately poor memory, Lol.)

There were many moments of surprise, laughter, excitement and sadness. But then we got to the climactic scenes with Luke, Vader, and Palpatine.

As the scenes played out I was not so subtly looking over at them to see their reactions as I listened to the action. As Luke was being shocked by Palpatine's Force Lightening, I saw visible frustration, anger and empathy. It truly looked like they were almost trying to manifest the Force \*themselves\* to help Luke, if that were possible...

Finally, Anakin Skywalker awakened one last time and audibly quipped ""NO! NNNnnnooooooooooo!!!!!"" The kids were slack jawed and couldn't believe it when the Emperor feebly fell down the bottomless pit. They clapped, they cheered. They quickly shushed each other when they realized that Dar... Anakin was laying on the ground sounding like he was in real bad shape.

Now when I first saw the version of RotJ where the ""NO!!!!"" stuff was added, like many I absolutely \*hated\* it. I still do, to be honest. But this is where some of Master Yoda's wisdom is perhaps setting me right.

After the film while we were discussing it, one of the kiddos, age 5, said this: ""Then when Darth Vader said NOOO really loud, I felt like he finally realized that the Dark Side was making him not love Luke, not love his son. And so he went on the Light Side because he loved Luke again and the Emperor couldn't trick him any more!""

Wooooo, let me tell you. Hearing that astutely wise assessment from a sweet and innocent little 5 year old girl's mouth without any prompting is truly special. I couldn't have conveyed the emotion of the scene better myself in a thousand words.

Earlier, when the film was just a couple minutes from ending, I noticed that my 9 year old was having a little bit of a tough time holding it together during Anakin's funeral pyre scene. I could tell that it was really hitting her hard seeing that final \*redeemed\* version of the awesome character she had loved so much from the earlier films and especially TCW be put to rest like that. I grimaced a little bit, then made a mental note to talk with her about it.

As the celebration with new music continued on Naboo, Coruscant, etc (ughhhhh, Lol) I suddenly remembered... WAIT, THIS IS THE HAYDEN VERSION!

And sure enough, just a few seconds later I fixed my gaze over on the kids when Hayden Christensen, as Anakin Skywalker, appeared next to Yoda and Obi-Wan.

I can say this with complete sincerity. I've never seen such an immediate and utterly complete emotional outpouring from my oldest daughter in her 9 years of life. She was absolutely \*destroyed\* and utterly \*overjoyed\* by Hayden-Anakin showing up in that way, all at once. It was just incredible to watch as you could literally see the emotions and the convictions and the love for the \*entire\* journey of the character of Anakin live itself out on her face, as though you were reading a book.

And all I've been able to think about since this happened is... 

I get it now, George. I understand. I see why you changed things and tinkered with elements that nobody else would have ever thought needed to be changed. You didn't do it for me. I grew up with your work as it was being released, I'm already ""hooked.""

No, you did it for my kids. And you know what? I hated it before. I really, truly did. But now?

I get it... Thank you.

74,Rewrite of the Sequels! (Part One: Episode 7),1596431017,"So this is just kinda something I decided to do since I'm bored in quarantine, so yeah. Episode 7 rewrite, let's go.

 

Now since these rewrites are based on the Original Trilogy, I‚Äôm not going to rewrite them. So, I‚Äôm going to skip the OT and instead start rewriting my own version of the Sequel Trilogy. 

PART ONE:¬† THE FORCE AWAKENS (Episode 7) 

Ok so, my story is going to be completely different to the Disney trilogy, so it‚Äôll have a different name. Idk what to put so comment down below what it should be named! 

Anyway, the film begins with Luke Skywalker on a random planet (maybe Malachor idk) and he‚Äôs investigating a sith temple. All goes well until he sees a red lightsaber, and holy shit it‚Äôs Darth Vader!¬†They exchange some small talk until Vader straight up force chokes Luke and Luke wakes up. It‚Äôs now 3 years after the Battle of Endor (the battle of Jakku didn‚Äôt happen in my story), and that Vader thing was all just a damn dream! Anyway, Luke goes for an early-morning walk, and tries to meditate. After a few minutes, he gets a call from Leia. The New Republic has discovered an old Imperial Outpost on Mygeeto, and Leia wants Luke and Han to check it out with her. Intrigued, Luke agrees, but Han is too busy hunting down Boba Fett, who somehow survived the Great Pit of Carkoon. Anyway, at the Outpost, Luke senses that the outpost is surrounded by the Dark Side. 

And what do they find? The burned suit of Darth Vader, still with Anakin Skywalker‚Äôs charred bones. A bit disturbed, Leia and Luke decide to take the body to Tatooine to bury him (Anakin now hates his children lol). After burying him, they decide to part ways, and Han and Leia have a child named Ben Solo. 

Alright about 27 years later, and we‚Äôre at the time of the original Force Awakens. Luke is now a Jedi Master, and with the help of the force ghosts of Yoda and Obi-Wan, he rebuilds the Jedi Order, and is teaching a new generation of Jedi, including the now Jedi Knight Ben Solo. They both feel a disturbance in the force and decide to contact Leia and Han. They all regroup and decide¬†to go back to Tatooine to check on Anakin‚Äôs grave. Surprise, Surprise, it‚Äôs been dug up and Vader‚Äôs body is gone. (Spoiler Alert; the First Order has taken Vader‚Äôs body and turned it into the ultimate Sith assassin, basically Grievous but the only remaining part of life is Vader. Anakin is still a force ghost and he died on the Death Star. His hate did not and manifested into its own personality and soul. Basically, Anakin died, but Vader didn‚Äôt.) 

Wanna guess who‚Äôs leading the First Order this time? Grand Moff (or in this case Supreme Leader) Tarkin, heavily deformed from being in a shuttle right next to the 2nd¬†Death¬†Star (because he survives the 1st¬†one in this version) right when it exploded, causing Tarkin‚Äôs shuttle to crash land on the nearby Forest Moon of Endor. He was able to escape on another Imperial ship and made his way to the nearest hospital and got as fixed up as he could. 

Anyway, he sends New Vader after Luke and the gang and Luke is forced to kill what remains of his father, kinda giving him a bit of PTSD, since it‚Äôs a bit scary to have to kill the person you buried 30 years ago. 

Anyway, Luke gets closure on his father‚Äôs death, but Snoke got away, so we have some ground to work off of for Episode 8.",StarWars,yaboispringy,False,/r/StarWars/comments/i2r2mo/rewrite_of_the_sequels_part_one_episode_7/

My theory is that Yoda very much has a philosophy of letting things play out. It differs from a lot of the other council members. If he‚Äôs not 100 percent he generally doesn‚Äôt act on things. The more tinfoil theory would be that Yoda believes this could be the Jedi orders great test. Seeing if his order is up to the challenge could be part of the grand great plan.

89,Why We Need a Clone Wars Style Sequel Era Animated Series,1596425499,"I think another Sequel Era animated show will improve people‚Äôs view of the sequels in the same way that Clone Wars improves the Prequel Era.

Note: Before anyone mentions Resistance, it was too focused on the Colossus to do what I am arguing for.

In my opinion the prequels and sequels have opposite but equally real problems. The prequels has great concepts and plot but mostly weak characterization. Now the sequels have amazing characters but not everyone loves the concepts and plot that were introduced.

I was 11, 14, and 17 when each of the prequels dropped. I went from loving TPM unconditionally to having to love them in hiding because it was ‚Äúcool‚Äù to hate the prequels. In my 20s Star Wars: The Clone Wars cake out and over the years it gave a context to the events and more importantly it made Anakin‚Äôs fall seem not as abrupt. I could say I loved the prequels without being self-conscious because any perceived problems were fixed by the show.

I think the sequel‚Äôs characters are much more compelling than the prequel‚Äôs (especially Finn, Rey, and Ben). The problem is there was no plan for the entire trilogy, so I don‚Äôt feel that Palpatine‚Äôs return was earned.

A sequel series can hint at his behind the scenes machinations and fill in Snoke‚Äôs role better. It can also show the political state of the galaxy, Ben‚Äôs training with Luke and his fall. 

A new series will give context to the sequels that will only improve the movies by allowing the audience to see a complete picture of the galaxy.",StarWars,Tonycam24,False,/r/StarWars/comments/i2puim/why_we_need_a_clone_wars_style_sequel_era/

9,Sequel Era show ideas,1596408158,"After the sequel trilogy there was a lot more to learn about certain characters and event taking place after Return of the Jedi. 
With the High Republic era book, comics and possibly a movie (if the project is a success) it is unlikely that we will receive any shows during the Sequel Era, so here are a few ideas for some shows I'd like to see in the near future.

- A post Return of the Jedi animated show showing us the events that take place for Luke, Leia, Han after the fall of the Empire. E.g Looking for the Sith Wayfinder, Luke training the new Jedi, The birth of Ben Solo. 
I feel a show like this could help people who didn't like the direction Luke's character took in TLJ get a look at Luke in his prime as a Jedi. Obviously we would eventually see his fall and his exile to Ach-To but I think it's be really cool to see Luke as a fully fledged Jedi in action.

- A Knights of Ren TV Show
As much as I enjoyed The Rise of Skywalker I was a bit disappointed in how little The Knights of Ren did. It would be great to see maybe a one series Live Action or animated show showing us the rise of The Knights of Ren and their training in the unknown regions.

- A post TROS show with Rey as the central character.
I feel like this one would be the least popular but I think if it focused on Rey it could give her more character development and show us the state of the galaxy after TROS. Possibly she could teach Finn the ways of the force or track down any surviving Jedi from Luke's order. I'm assuming Rey isn't likely to rebuild the Jedi order (after what happened last time) so it would be interesting to see what direction she takes with other force sensitive people.

43,Jedi: Fallen Order reinforces The Last Jedi in many ways,1596389839," There are several different parallels between the two. Here's what I found:

* Cere Junda‚Äôs arc in this game is very similar to Luke‚Äôs in TLJ. She failed her apprentice (and the other students in her care), which led to the apprentice‚Äôs fall to the Dark Side. After this, Cere/Luke cut themselves off from the Force but still end up mentoring a promising youth (Cal/Rey). Towards the end, he/she opens back up to the Force and sees their former apprentice one final time.
* Themes of failure, regrowth and legacy made explicit.
* Kylo Ren and the Second Sister are both Dark Siders who hide their true self behind a mask and feel betrayed by their former master resulting in a deep hatred for them. They both also encounter a younger Force user who is mentored by their former master.
* Cal and Kylo are more similar than you'd think. Both have to escape the shadow of their idealized predecessor to grow. (Jaro Tapal for Cal and Darth Vader for Kylo.) Both also have the ability to freeze objects and opponents with the Force.
* The strong hostility Rey and Cal both have with their masters and their lying.
* Speaking of Rey and Cal, the two have a lot in common. Both come from similar professions (one‚Äôs a scavenger and the other's a salvager) and deal with a lot of trauma involving their pasts. (Rey‚Äôs parentage and Cal‚Äôs experiences with Order 66.) They both end up breaking their inherited lightsaber and have to make it their own to fix it. (Cal combines Tapal and Cere‚Äôs hilts together and Rey forges the two halves of the Skywalker lightsaber together.) Rey and Cal also end up leaving their lives on trash heap worlds to go on great adventures and neither initially saw him/herself as much. (‚ÄúI‚Äôm nobody.‚Äù / ‚ÄúI‚Äôm trash, just not approved trash.‚Äù) They both have an important vision with a mirror before facing their adversary and it can be argued that both have used some degree of psychometry (Cal uses it several times throughout the game, Rey ‚Äúused‚Äù it when she touched the Skywalker lightsaber in TFA.)
* The idea of the Zeffo society lines up perfectly with Luke‚Äôs words during the The Last Jedi. (‚ÄúThe Force does not belong to the Jedi. To say if the Jedi dies, the light dies is vanity.‚Äù)

The best part in ANH for me was exploring this alien world with its vast desert landscapes, rocky terrain and wonderful world building within the first half of the movie. 

I love the architecture design of the moisture farmer houses as well mos eisley. I like how the farmstead is like a cave built under the ground, yet it looks so cozy and homely. 

I also love the world they set up. The danger of Tuscan raiders attacking outline settlements. The jawas who roam across the barren land looking for droids to sell. The cool giant skeleton near c3po. 

I recently saw the cut scenes of anchorhead in the bluray and found it fascinating that we got to see anchorhead and luke even mentions the sand people attacking outline settlements. The whole place has a frontier spirit to it of dangervand mystery.  Oh and let's not forget the mysterious old wizard obi wan who lives beyond the dune sea. They also name drop a lot of different areas that makes it feel more authentic.

Then in ROTJ we see even more of the planet. How hutt gangsters live in huge palaces out in the middle of nowhere. The strange sarlac monster in the dune sea. 

TPM also added podracing which was a pretty awesome scene. I wasn't a huge fan of episode 1 but I have to admit I enjoyed the tatooine section of the film.

77,The Umbara arc- so much potential but it didn‚Äôt quite do it for me [spoilers TCW],1596353479,"Hey guys, I‚Äôve been watching the Clone Wars show for the first time and I wanted to talk about the Umbara arc I just finished watching which is a really interesting storyline that I think ultimately falls short of what it could have been. There‚Äôs a lot to like here but also I think there are some missed opportunities.

I really like the focus on the clones. In my opinion the episodes that focus on clones are usually the best because there is dramatic tension around their actions. When you‚Äôre watching Anakin, Dooku, Plo Koon, Grievous, etc. there aren‚Äôt any stakes in the action because you know that they have to live to Episode 3. However, with clones we generally don‚Äôt have this problem. And although this show sometimes uses them as redshirts too much, this arc introduces some good clone characters like Hardcase, Jesse, Dogma, etc. 

I like the idea for this arc. It‚Äôs kind of like a war movie, it reminded me of stuff like Full Metal Jacket or Saving Private Ryan. They do a good job at making the battles feel tense with the atmosphere of the planet and the way the battles are framed. I think this is probably the best part of this arc, it just has a lot of style and atmosphere to it, and it‚Äôs just expertly done. And broadly, the idea of a general who gives reckless orders that the men have to disobey to win is pretty cool for this show when most of the time the leaders are wise and compassionate.

I think all of my issues with this arc mainly center around the character of Krell. Pong Krell could have been an amazing character but the potential is squandered. The main problem is that the audience is never given a reason to trust this guy, so his ‚Äúbig betrayal‚Äù ends up just feeling like a shrug and a ‚Äúyeah that seems about right‚Äù. We are told that his methods are reckless but have achieved victory multiple times. Here is where I think some showing rather than telling would have been more effective. I think they should have introduced Krell much earlier in the show, maybe in Season 2 or something, as a ruthless but efficient military leader. He could appear every once in a while along with the other Jedi masters and we could see his victories for ourselves, along with building his relationships with people like Ahsoka or Obi Wan. This way, he could fool the audience along with the other characters, and his betrayal would hit even deeper. As it is, the moment we are introduced to him we are primed to dislike him, he calls the clones by their numbers and he only has one strategy, which is a full frontal assault, which generates zero results on Umbara.

Another aspect to consider: wouldn‚Äôt this arc be more interesting if Pong Krell was not a fallen Jedi? The entire time I was pretty sure he was a Sith who was betraying the Republit but I hoped the entire time that he wasn‚Äôt because it would be so much more nuanced and interesting if he was A. An incompetent leader that the clones had to disobey to win or B. A general who is so loyal to the republic and dislikes clones so much that he is willing to sacrifice every last man to win. As it is in the show, I rolled my eyes when he started laughing maniacally and saying ‚Äúyou were a puppet, I used you for your mens‚Äô loyalty‚Äù etc. because it turns a morally grey situation into a black and white one. Krell being a competent leader who hates clones (maybe you could write a tragic backstory where a clone killed his family or something) would be so much more interesting than the mustache twirling villain he becomes by the end of the arc. 

Another issue for me is that this episode doesn‚Äôt do a good job justifying how Pong Krell is even a Jedi master in the first place. I mean, I know the Jedi have made a lot of questionable decisions but this guy is so blatantly evil that I just can‚Äôt see how anyone with two brain cells to run together couldn‚Äôt see through it. Which again, brings me back to what I said earlier, I think the reveal would be so much more effective if they had shown us him interacting with other Jedi and how he deceived them. Either that or just don‚Äôt have the twist, I still think it‚Äôs a more interesting arc if he isnt trying to join the Sith, but if he‚Äôs just a loyal general who has lost himself in the war. It makes Rex and Krell‚Äôs conflict more complex and removes the easy answers.

A few minor points:

I was confused by the end of the episode. The clones say that Umbarans will retake the base and Krell will go free, but then the clones say later that they have taken the planet. How did they go from ‚ÄúUmbarans will retake this base‚Äù to ‚Äúoh we won‚Äù in such a short timeframe?

I thought the clones killing other clones moment was cool but it was way too obvious, the moment Krell said that the enemy would be disguised as clones I knew what would happen.

Why do these Umbarans live on this planet that seems to have a deadly atmosphere to them? I assume it‚Äôs deadly to them because they wear those helmets but maybe I misunderstood that

I think it would have been cool if when Fives‚Äô squad was flying the enemy ships, if Republic units started shooting at them, it would have been cool to see them in a friendly fire situation because of their deception

Krell actually reminded me of Holdo from TLJ, except Krell was incompetence and made his troops distrust him on purpose, while Holdo was incompetent and made her troops distrust her seemingly on accident.

I thought it was funny that Fives was the one who said that clones are not just numbers, bit of irony there

I don‚Äôt understand why Rex says that clones are not programmed, is it not common knowledge that they are programmed? I mean if there are at least 66 orders, do the clones not know about any of them until they are activated?

Anyway in conclusion, this arc started off strong but ended weak. I thought Krell could have been a fascinating character with a lot of depth, but his motivation of ruling part of the galaxy in the new Empire is sooo boring and played out. It‚Äôs too bad because I think the voice actor does a great job and the design is cool. Two double bladed lightsabers is a good concept. Also the voice actor does a great job. But yeah in the end the writing for this arc doesn‚Äôt quite reach the great heights it seemed like it was heading towards.",StarWars,decross20,False,/r/StarWars/comments/i288q9/the_umbara_arc_so_much_potential_but_it_didnt/

91,Star Wars Completionist Marathon Chronicles: Episode 1- The Phantom Menace,1596344735,"Hello there my dudes. At the beginning of June I decided to go through a Completionist Marathon of Star Wars, as the title states. I was originally going write about the experience once I was done with the marathon, but I realized I'd probably forget a lot of things I would want to talk about by the time I finished. I'm currently watching Rebels, but I'm starting these chronicles from the beginning with The Phantom Menace. I'll share a memory about each movie/series before I get into my thoughts after the rewatch. 

The Phantom Menace was my first taste of Stars Wars at the age of four (I'm a prequels kid and my bias for the prequels will probably show throughout these writings). I remember my dad watching TPM in the living room and I came in halfway through the fight between Maul, Qui Gon, and Obi Wan. Probably not the best for a four year-old to see Qui Gon get ruthlessly murdered by Maul during their first 5 minutes of Star Wars, but needless to say I was hooked and the rest was history.

Going into this marathon I tried to look at everything through a somewhat more objective lense than the nostalgic one I usually watch Star Wars with. Here's some of my thoughts:

-Jake Lloyd's acting is pretty bad, but you can't really blame him either. He was a little kid just trying to have fun in a once-in-a-lifetime experience. It was cringy at times watching him, but I think somehow is acting portrayed a relatively innocent young kid that I would expect Anakin to be at the time. I honestly don't understand why people got so worked up and hated on him so much. It wasn't until about a year ago that I found out how bad people treated him because as a kid watching the movie, I just thought he was a fellow kid getting to act in my favorite movie franchise. cameo. 

-It was cool seeing Quinlan Vos. His story In Dark Disciple really made me appreciate the character and makes me wish he got more screen time. At least he got to make an appearance on the big screen!

-Jar Jar isn't that bad. He's freaking annoying at times, but he was meant to get a few laughs out of kids and not much else. It worked on me as a kid, and annoys me at times now. Honestly I don't expect much else from that type of character, and I'm overall okay with him being in the prequels and TCW.  I'm glad Ahmed Best is doing better now and hosting that Jedi Temple competition. Like Lloyd, he was an actor who didn't  deserve all the hate he got. Side  note, not to brag or anything, but I can do a pretty decent Jar Jar impersonation.

-The fight between Maul, Obi Wan, and Qui Gon is straight up amazing. John Williams' magic makes it ever better. Words can't describe how blessed the Star Wars franchise is for having him create the scores for the movies.

-I think the only reason the Anakin-Padme relationship seems weird is because of how old they are. Anakin is 9 and Padme is 14 in TPM. Normally, 5 years is not a big difference (at least in my opinion). I think they could've done a better job at creating a relationship between the two than they did in this movie. Even as a kid, I always thought starting the relationship with them both being so young was weird even though it wasn't really romantic in TPM anyways. Honestly, Anakin's and Padme's dialogue/relationship in this movie was probably my least favorite part of TPM.

-The scenery for Naboo is beautiful.

-Podracing seemed epic to me when I was younger and it still does now.

-Qui Gon was I think the best example of what a Jedi should be at the time. He wasn't following the politics of the Republic guide his actions like the other Jedi we're doing, but allowed the Force to guide him. He was more wise in that sense than other Jedi.

-The way they set up Palpatine In this movie was really interesting. He is a master manipulator. The politics were always one of my favorite parts of the prequels and Palps reminded me of this fact in this episode.

- I don't know why but hearing Anakin yell ""Yippee!"" has always sounded unnatural to me.  How many kids have you heard say ""Yippee"" in a normal situation? I never have.

-Padme's ship is one of my favorite ships in all of Star Wars. I don't really need to explain why, it just looks so cool to me.

- I will probably mention this a lot throughout these posts, but Lucas did a great job introducing difficult topics in a franchise meant for kids. When I was younger I was able to generally comprehend what was at stake in this movie and the others, while not being scarred for life or not feeling sad the entire movie. It was both light- hearted fun for me and an opportunity to learn. I think now that I'm older I understand the complexities of these situations more than I did when I was little, but regardless, Lucas made is the franchise fun and impactful for all ages.

That's is it for my first writing. This sounds pretty uninteresting imo, but I've already forgotten some stuff and that's probably why it seems so dull to me. Hopefully these will get better as I continue.

98,Why did the Empire want the Child (Baby Yoda) in The Mandalorian?,1596341410,"I'm definitely behind on the discussion of this, but I wanted to hear some other people's thoughts. I'm a bit hazy on the specifics around some of the newer lore, so if there's anything I get wrong or not completely accurate, please say so. 

My theory is that the Empire plan to use ""the Child"" for cloning the Emperor for his return in The Rise of Skywalker. 

The series takes place after episode 6 where the Emperor dies and supposedly transfers to a temporary body. Maybe for the cloning process to work, they require force sensitive genetic code to replicate. Similar to Fett's role in the clone army. Plus, the doctor who is with the Empire did sport a Kamino cloning symbol on his arm. 

The series also takes place on the far edge of the galaxy where the Emperor was hiding and probably had forces out and about to rebuild the Empire (The First Order) and a smaller force to help him regain his full strength (Giancarlo Esposito's character's role). 

Details are hard to come by and definitely going to be discussed in season 2 of the show, but I feel like that if Disney is going to branch out the lore and help explain/expand the sequel trilogy, The Mandalorian would be a good way to do so. The show already blends prequel and original trilogy seamlessly so I don't see why they can't do it with the sequels too.

Also, I noticed the Mandalorian's who saved the Mando had a symbol on their armor reminiscent of Deathwatch and hope they go into that a bit more. Who knows. Just a side detail.

If this isn't a new theory, I apologize, but that's my guess on where the show is headed in season 2 and wanted to hear other opinions and thoughts.",StarWars,nyeend,False,/r/StarWars/comments/i25zm0/why_did_the_empire_want_the_child_baby_yoda_in/

2,My mom watched some Star Wars tonight. Let me tell you about it,1596340073,"So I've been doing a rewatch of Star Wars from episode 1. Watched that, AOTC, all of the Clone Wars, and just finished season 7 earlier tonight. I wanted to watch ROTS now. I went up to my mom and said ""hey wanna watch a movie tonight?"" She said, ""Sure."" And then I said, ""we're watching Star Wars, no take backs!"" 

Let me back up. My mom has seen some of the OT and PT out of order, at least 15 years ago, half paying attention. Never in a good run through. When Disney started releasing their movies, she came with me to the opening night of each movie, but then never saw a rewatch with me. She has seen Mando once.

That brings me back to tonight. I explained the backstory of Episode 1 and 2 (didn't want to rewatch those again because I did that two weeks ago, before watching Clone Wars. Basically, in asking her to watch with me, I was not going to interrupt my viewing experience.) Having given her a full ELI5 of episodes 1 and 2, we watched ROTS. I am surprised she watched a rewatch of a movie, but afterwards, she was very impressed. She said she remembered some of the characters but now understands it a lot better. She knew who Darth Vader really was, but forgot how Anakin turned.

I never had what you‚Äôd call real parents. They abandoned me, and I‚Äôve grown up in a house with a neglectful aunt and uncle. With that being said, I‚Äôve had to work all my life (I‚Äôm 19) to find the people who really care. My family. My tribe.

Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) does this well too, but not in the way that Solo does. When Beckett says ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the difference‚Äù to the ‚Äútribe or family‚Äù line I couldn‚Äôt help but tear up real hard.

I just watched a [video](https://youtu.be/AFWXyiQqQ6s) that friend sent me.      
I've heard people bashing on KK often and I'm hoping for some enlightenment.        
        
While I know she's the head of Disney/Lucas film but I really don't understand how much direction she has with the series in general. Or, more specifically, the stories being told.    
      
I assume that she is the one, of many, who green lights films like the spin offs but I wonder how much of the story is in her grasp.      
 
J.J. wrote the first and last of the sequel trilogy and RJ wrote the second. We all know this. I'm just wondering how much of the film's story and telling of it was up to her?     
    
Seems to me that the writers were the ones who told the story and KK approved it.  Am I wrong? How much involvement did she really have in the story that got told? Shouldn't we all hate on the lot of you didn't care for the film's?
  
I also heard that there was a Lucas cut. Where did that come from? I mean, by the name it's obvious but how the hell is he involved? How is he doing ""cuts""?        
     
I know this is just a YT video and it could be all bs of course, and most likely is, but this isn't the first time I've heard about the Lucas cut.       
      
Can anyone help enlighten me about the inner workings of how KK, RJ and JJ are all involved please?

Every action in life will have consequences and will always result in something good, or bad. In the early years of the Galactic Republic, the world of Coruscant was colonized, and thus, began the domination of the Senate and Supreme Chancellor in the galaxy. We start roughly around The Phantom Menace (32 BBY) and will cut off there, starting our own alternate timeline. We use the BBY and ABY system to avoid confusion around the timing, however, the Clone Wars and other subjects stated in the movie franchise from after 32 BBY will not be happening. We are a political RP server, mainly focusing on being Senators of many different Star Wars worlds, and with new ones being added all the time, however, there are always other options to join, for example, become a Jedi, a famous celebrity, a lawyer, or even a general.

What do we offer?

-Intriguing political roleplay.
-Fun and exciting events.
-A variety of roles and jobs.
-Helpful and active staff.
-A non-toxic community.
-Immersive timeline and drama.

86,"Jedi, clones, and Inquisitors between Clone Wars and A New Hope",1596314481,"Hello all,

&amp;#x200B;

I am making my way through Rebels right now (love it even more than TCW) and was just wondering what everyone's opinions were on the amount of Jedi / Clones / Sith that exist between TCW and ANH. For me, it seemed a little odd at first - I'm something of a purist that by the time ANH happens, the only Jedi in existence are Luke / Obi Wan / Yoda, and the only Sith is Vader. It's a little uncomfortable to imagine there are other alternative 'hopes' the Rebels aren't using or that these Jedi are unwilling to help. Additionally, the focus on Rex and Ahsoka feels a little strong - basically saying it's clear these are Filoni's favorite personal creations and find it hard to 'kill his darlings.' For Sith / darksiders, the sheer amount of inquisitors is a little odd and I find it weird Vader has his own personal army of lightsaber warriors. He never seemed aspirational in that way and clearly Palpatine himself wanted to limit the amount of force-wielders in general. 

&amp;#x200B;

Even outside of Rebels, Cal Kestis now exists (for how long, who knows) and rumors of Quinlan Vos, Barriss Offee, and a few others are going around.

&amp;#x200B;

All that said, I've really come around to Ezra and Kanan, and am really excited to see what happens in the future with Rex and Ahsoka.

This also undermines the emotional weight of Anakin's fall in RotS, because his fate is already known.

If the story had been released chronologically, RotS probably would have needed to end in a way that resembled the story Obi Wan told Luke. We might have realized that something was off when he said Vader killed Anakin, when we knew it was Obi Wan that struck him down, but we might not have known that Anakin had survived and become Vader.

Obviously, we'd have to cut all references to that name from RotS and his transformation scenes, so the persona of Vader first appears in ANH, and we could only speculate as to who was under the mask.",StarWars,dodgyhashbrown,False,/r/StarWars/comments/i1z5s8/shower_thought_if_the_first_two_trilogies_had/

As time went on the play became more and their love grew. Eventually they were each called on by their family‚Äôs to serve there purpose. The boy needed to take his fathers place as the hunter for his tribe and the girl became a pilot to help provide money for her family. They grew older and over time the boy became a legendary bounty hunter and the girl became a famous pilot. They had forgotten the faces of the ones they loved. Now one day the boy was hired to take out a ship that had been smuggling goods past a crime lord. He took his ship and eventually he found his mark. There was a great star battle between the two ships and eventually the boy had damaged the ship enough he could dock and board. However his ship was badly damaged as well. Room by room he went through the ship killing the crew until only the cockpit was left as he entered he saw the captain pressed in the corner with a blaster ready to fire, it was the girl. They both stood there staring, in shock they dropped their blasters. The girl began to laugh and ran and Embraced him. They stood there in each others arms for long moments. Though they had forgotten each other‚Äôs faces their love was still there. Suddenly there was a beeping from the control panel. The girl ran over and saw the horror of the situation. They were on a coalition corse with a collapsing star. She tried to fix the sip but there was no use. They were doomed to crash. The lovers embraced for the last time and held each other until there ship collided with the star. And the energy of the ships explosion cased the star to go super nova.

The purpose of the rule of two was to get more powerful than the jedi and to destroy their order finally (that happened in ROTS). But I think thr rule of two was just a plan of darth bane two get more powerful and to become immortal. I don't think a sith would ""sacrifice"" himself to destroy the jedi (in more than 1000 years in this case) so I think as his apprentice (legends: Darth Zannah, canon: unknown) killed him he transfered his mind into his student and again and again... and he did this for more than 1000 years to get more powerful and to earn more knowledge about the dark side until palpatine. What if palpatines mind was to strong and so banes and palpatines mind had molten together and palpatine earned the knowledege of hundreds of generations of sith. The only requirement of the essence transfer was that you have been killed out of hate, anger or other negative feelings. As Vader killed palpatine he did out of love to luke and the mind of the both couldn't take over vaders body. During their fall banes and palpatines mind severed and bane died at last in palpatines body. Palpatine could safe himself to get in a clone body but palptines mind had still memories of many sith secrets and knowledge and a cloned body was just to weak to hold all this knowledge and it started to disintegrate. So after all Darth Bane (his mind) died in ROTJ and Palpatine died in TROS. Please forgive any spelling or writing mistakes it's not my native language.

Here‚Äôs the thing:

I think this was on purpose. Yoda knew the clones would follow his orders to the letter, and didn‚Äôt want to confuse them by speaking weirdly. This is further substantiated by the odd delivery of the line, it seems like Yoda is struggling to say it. This would imply that he can speak ‚Äúnormally,‚Äù if he concentrates.

I don‚Äôt know, as a kid who grew up with the prequels assuming this was simply a mistake, I‚Äôm gonna accept this as my headcanon.

22,Why This Character's Return Didn't Bother Me At All,1596239784,"To clarify, going to see *The Phantom Menace* in theaters with my dad as an eight year old boy was my first Star Wars experience and Maul quickly became one of my all-time favorite characters. Even with little-no knowledge of his backstory, two lines of dialogue in-film, and no knowledge of his appearances in EU material, I honestly didn't care. From 1999 onward, young me fell in love with Maul.

&amp;#x200B;

I had toys, action figures, and practiced drawing that face pattern for years. I loved every aspect from his outfit to the quiet mystique, makeup, horns, and (obviously) my introduction to the double-bladed lightsaber. Granted, it was my introduction to lightsabers in general. Even then, however, my reaction to seeing that second blade activate for the first time was *""Holy crap, you can do that?!""*

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, it didn't compare to veteran fans' reactions. Point being, I fully admit to some nostalgic bias when it comes to my opinions on Maul, which in all likelihood played a part in my excitement at his return in *The Clone Wars*. It wasn't until I was much older that I first watched through the OT (my preferred trilogy today in terms of overall quality) and saw the parallel between Maul's fall and Luke's.

&amp;#x200B;

It's practically become a tradition at this point for *Star Wars* heroes &amp; villains to fall and/or be thrown from great heights down various holes, pits, shafts, vents, reactor cores, etc. What puzzled me at the time Maul's return was confirmed, however, was so many fans' arguments of *""This is completely implausible! How could he survive being cut in half and then falling that far down. Totally unrealistic!""*

&amp;#x200B;

**With all that in mind, here are my reasons why Maul's survival didn't affect my suspension of disbelief in the slightest. What was your reaction and why? Feedback is welcome:**

&amp;#x200B;

**1) MAUL- WAS- AN- ALIEN:** This may sound like a cop-out excuse to some, but I never thought of it as that much of a stretch. The galaxy far, far away has always been known for its diverse flora &amp; fauna. Much of the details regarding this universe's lifeforms has always been left to the imagination (even with all the supplementary information released in visual dictionaries, there's a lot left unexplored).

&amp;#x200B;

And even to little kids like me, it was blatantly obvious that Maul was designed as a non-human species despite his humanoid figure and ability to speak English. No matter how closely a character may resemble a human structure, this does not mean or imply that they follow the same rules of anatomical damage. Granted, there was no evidence onscreen to suggest that Maul could survive that.

&amp;#x200B;

By the same token, however, there was no evidence to suggest he was incapable of surviving either. We knew nothing about his species, anatomy, resistance to blunt force trauma/terminal velocity, etc. We can criticize this as cheap if we want. But the fact is, this type of retcon is not a new practice in storytelling. Characters previously confirmed dead being revived has been done for decades.

&amp;#x200B;

The trick is in how you execute it. The ambiguity surrounding Maul's character in-film ironically worked to *The Clone Wars*' advantage when deciding how to explain &amp; justify his survival because the writers had a wealth of creative freedom. The catch was, the crew knew this retcon would be controversial among fans and thus had to be careful in portraying it. Aside from that, it was pretty fair game.

&amp;#x200B;

Ex- Maul's vital organs, intestines, and other important parts could've been located in a different part of the body, and it turned out that Obi-Wan missed all of that when he cut through. Even accounting for the *TPM* visual dictionary, there was plenty about the character's biology that remained a mystery. Heck, for all we knew in theaters at the time, he could've had wings hidden beneath those robes.

&amp;#x200B;

As someone who grew up seeing aliens in movies, TV, comics, and video games, I was used to the concept of extraterrestrials recovering from dismemberment. I've seen myriad creatures (aliens, demons, mutants, etc) lose hands, arms, legs, heads, or large amounts of their entire body. I've seen them survive steep falls, being sliced up, shot apart, burned, exploded, and/or melted with acid.

&amp;#x200B;

I've seen them return from what would typically be certain death with mechanical parts, cybernetics, regeneration (one of my childhood examples being *Dragonball*'s Piccolo, who's literally come back from being reduced to pieces), magic, reincarnation, and other plot-device explanations. Bottom line, in my experience with sci-fi and fantasy, being bisected + falling is not invariably a death sentence.

&amp;#x200B;

**2) Darth Vader survived for decades after suffering debilitating injuries despite being ""more machine than man"":** Again, this point of view is partially influenced by me growing up with the Prequels before seeing the OT, but I found Maul's debut in *TCW* with mechanical spider legs completely plausible after having seen Grievous &amp; Vader. Obviously, there are contextual differences.

&amp;#x200B;

Anakin suffered four lost limbs + severe burns over his entire body that left him incapable of even breathing on his own for long. He also had to stay alive for a shorter amount of time on Mustafar before Palpatine found and saved him from death via surgery &amp; medicine. Maul by contrast lost everything from the waist down, presumably fell several stories, and had to survive for years all alone.

&amp;#x200B;

How/when he acquired his spider legs is never shown or spoken of onscreen (unless it's exposited in *TCW* season 7, I haven't watched it yet), but there are multiple possibilities to speculate on, given what is established in past canonical material for what Force users are capable of. Ex- Maul could've used the Force to build his spider legs from random parts on the junk planet he ended up on.

&amp;#x200B;

If Jedi can construct lightsabers through meditative concentration, it stands to reason that Dark Side users can also manipulate the right parts to form working machines. I can understand how/why some fans may find this a harder pill to swallow, given how Maul would've had no discernible help and little time to manage his wounds before dying of exhaustion and/or blood loss. This leads to my next point.

&amp;#x200B;

**3) Anger and pain make Dark Side users stronger:** While it was never explicitly stated in-film that pain strengthens Dark Side users, the visual storytelling made it easy to figure out even for me as a kid (Not to mention, pain is often an effective motivator for anger irl). Ex- Vader's agony from living inside his suit serving as a constant source of anger from which to draw on in addition to his tragic past. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is further evidenced in *TFA* when Kylo Ren/Ben Solo repeatedly hits his bowcaster wound from Chewbacca, using the pain to fuel his anger &amp; adrenaline. Even for an undisciplined, inexperienced apprentice, this demonstrably works well enough to keep him fighting for a few minutes. Of course, there's a limit to how fatal an injury Force users can survive (severed head, cut down the middle, etc).

&amp;#x200B;

Nonetheless, if we can suspend disbelief at an individual surviving being dismembered + burned alive with internal lung damage through sheer hatred &amp; rage, then it shouldn't be that much of a stretch to believe one could draw on the same force of will even with their bottom half gone. Before someone brings up how Maul didn't go splat from the fall he took, I'd like to transition to exhibit D.

&amp;#x200B;

**4) Force users can use their power to slow high falls:** It's been shown since the OT that Force-sensitives can enhance their agility beyond physical limits for high jumps. And, however OT fans may try to rationalize it, I find it very hard to believe that Luke would've survived his fall in *ESB* without the Force giving him some assistance as he tumbled down after being sucked into that chute on Bespin.

&amp;#x200B;

In the Prequels, we saw this expanded to Jedi surviving downward jumps that would shatter an ordinary person's legs by slowing their descent. How else would Obi-Wan, Qui-Gon, and Maul have avoided shattering their limbs or turning to bloody pancakes after some of the falls they took in the Duel of the Fates? Like all Force abilities, this involves channeling that energy field through your body.

&amp;#x200B;

Combine this with Dark Side users' aforementioned ability to strengthen themselves via anger/pain, and it's perfectly plausible that even a bisected Maul could survive his fall. We don't see what the bottom of *TPM*'s reactor looks like, so there's no proof that he couldn't have landed in a similar manner to Luke on Bespin. Palpatine could've done it in *RotJ* too, were it not for being vaporized. 

&amp;#x200B;

**5) Star Wars physics have NEVER been realistic:** Yes, I fully acknowledge how this sounds like a cop-out but it's the truth. I'm not suggesting we should blindly believe everything we see on grounds that *""this is a movie about space wizards intended for children""* (a quote certain people love to pull when they have no other argument), but it is important to recognize that *Star Wars* has always been fantasy.

&amp;#x200B;

Even without the Force, this universe has never played by the same laws of physics as ours and that's okay. If everything in the franchise was realistic, that would fundamentally kill its appeal even if you retained the elements of magic. By criticizing Maul's return on grounds of realism while suspending disbelief at equally fantastical feats, one could argue we're holding his character to a double-standard.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's be honest. The reason several fans firmly believed Maul couldn't be anything else but dead is mainly because Lucas &amp; Lucasfilm said so. At the time, there was no plan to bring him back so viewers generally accepted it because he'd served his purpose for the story Lucas wanted to tell. Had George confirmed a possibility of Maul returning after the fact, would the backlash really have been the same?

36,Clone Wars lack of weapons and fights diversity,1596235915," Am I the only one to find the Clone's Wars gunfight a little bit to similar ?

We  almost always have close encounters and head-on attacks. I wish you  would have more stealth attack and long range battle with sniper  riffles. Even with the Bad batch episodes, where we had a little bit of  that, it was sloppy at best before returning to the usual gunfights.

I  think there could have been some great snipers battle in worlds like  Kashyyyk with a lot of tension coming from camouflaged ennemies. And I  can't even begin on the subject of the Republic commandos. The stealth  missions would be a perfect fit for them. It's a pity we will have a Bad  Batch show with clich√©d troopers (the hunter, the sniper, the muscles  bag, the tech guy...) and not a Delta Squad show.

And  it would also be good to have actual tactical logic in the show.  The  clones seems to have troubles with going to covert and have each others  back. For droids, you can understand such tactics since droids are  manufactured and it's not a huge loss. But a clone trooper... You would  expect them to not just jump in front of the lasers. When you have **Jango Fett** designing the training, you would definitely hope  tactical abilities to be on other level than ""Just charge !"" 

A  person told me that he actually thought that this lack of tactics is  because of the Jedi. The clones have to obey the Jedi but the Jedi have  no tactical training at all. It does make sense on a larger scale but we  have seen countless time clones being order to do something (take an  objectif for example) but without specific instructions on how. And they  still have less coordination than the worst airsoft team.

Btw,  it could have been a great point to make against the Jedi. We have seen  some assholes like Pong Krell who just doesn't give a shit about the  clones but we haven't really seen respectfull Jedi failing on the  battlefield because they didn't listen to the clones officers' advices.

How did races like the Mandalorians, Twi‚Äôleks, and Rodians even survive before mastering space travel? Is it because resources are strained once a world opens up to the galaxy, therefore welcoming others to consume these resources? Is it due to a common issue of over population? During the time of the Empire makes sense since places under Imperial rule would be siphoned of resources by the Empire but this is before that.

I know a lot of you are thinking ""We already have a game called Star Wars: Bounty Hunter!"", but that game is crap compared to what im asking for.

These characters changed force users from being amplified beings to superheroes and changed the use of force from something that empowers or amplifies to a magical field that can be called upon to wield awesome powers or make the user invincible or destroy entire planets etc etc. 

It makes what are widely regarded as ""Powerful"" jedi and sith of the republic/rebellion/resistance ages seem comically inept at wielding the force when we're at the same time supposed to believe that Vader and Palpatine and Luke and Yoda were some of the most powerful that ever were.  

Yoda goes from mystical genius mega jedi to someone that can be slapped aside.  Even Vader, who is characterized as one of the most powerful sith ever to live and is shown doing amazing feats would be shrugged off by a number of EU old republic force users.  It just feels like Revan-esqe characters went full Dragonball Z and it's annoying to me.

14,"Cooperation, midichlorians, and why The Phantom Menace is so important to the story of the prequels and the saga",1596179249,"I'm not gonna lie, I adore The Phantom Menace and I always did. It was my first SW movie and it's still my fourth favorite movie. All around, I love what its about, I love the themes, and I love what it does for this universe.

The fundamental theme of The Phantom Menace is the need for cooperation and coexistence among people. This theme is quite literally seen everywhere. Most prominently summed up by Anakin, ""the biggest problem in the universe is that nobody helps each other"". It is this lack of cooperation that ultimately enables Palpatine, the dark lord of the Sith, to manipulate the Senate and propel himself to the top. He would capitalize on the distrust people had in their institutions and leaders, and he would incite a conflict between Queen Amidala and Chancellor Valorum, which would end in Valorum getting removed and Palpatine elected in his place. The Senate was full of greedy, squabbling delegates with no interest in the common good, and Palpatine would exploit this to the fullest. Palpatine would go on to instigate one of the worst wars in history, set everyone against everyone, and then used the chaos, fear, and paranoia to assume absolute power. That is the way of the Sith, ultimately.

The film also depicts the conflict between the Naboo and the Gungans, who share the same planet, but don't cooperate. The Jedi quickly notice and remind them they form a circle with the Naboo and that whatever evil happens to one will affect the other. Over the course of the movie, they must learn to cooperate if they are to survive and repel the Trade Federation. There are some clear racial tensions here, as the Naboo and the Gungans live apart from each other and the Naboo are characterized by a certain kind of pompous arrogance. They are an advanced, prosperous, democratic society and they believe themselves to be far better than they are. However, Gungans are anything but primitives, having an advances society of their own, majestic underwater cities, and developed cultural norms. In the end, Amidala realizes what must be done and she uses Jar Jar as a bridge between the Naboo and the Gungans to form an alliance and finally expel the Federation from their world. She shows humbleness and demonstrates to the Gungans that they can find common language with the Naboo. Hubris is also a recurring theme in the prequels, mostly when it comes to the Jedi and how it completely led them astray, as they couldn't see the absolute evil lurking in their midst.

But The Phantom Menace goes even further in pushing the theme of cooperation and symbiosis in that it asserts that cooperation and symbiosis are the basis of all existence. That is what the midichlorians are. They are a microscopic lifeforms which live in symbiosis with all living things and they enable life to exist. All the energy from the living Force, from all things that have ever lived, feeds into the cosmic Force, and communicates with the living through the midichlorians. Midichlorians aren't some kind of attempt to reduce the Force somehow. No, they expand the Force, they expand what its about and they expand its power. That is what the midichlorians are about. Furthermore, knowledge of the midichlorians also tells us something that Lucas was keen to relaying too - this was a more civilized, better time. The Jedi were not only guardians of peace and justice, they were also explorers, scholars, diplomats, and many other things. They studied the Force for a thousand generations, it makes sense they would know little intricacies like this. Midichlorians are probably the most heavily misinterpreted and misrepresented aspect of the prequels. I read many old reviews of the movie when it came out, and so many completely ignored the entire story of the movie in order to paint an entirely false narrative.

In conclusion... at the start of The Phantom Menace, we are presented with a far better galaxy than in ANH. People knew more about reality, the Jedi were dispersed far and wide, there was democracy, there was freedom, and there were lots of problems, but they all pale in comparison to the abominable Empire. That was the reason why The Phantom Menace is set so long before ANH and why its so fundamental to the story of the prequels. George wanted to chart a course of progression from the glories of the Republic to the tyranny of the Empire, and to do so, he had to show what the Jedi and the Republic were like before everything went down the drain. In the entire OT, we never once got to learn what the Republic was and why the Rebels were so keen on restoring it. That is why any viewing list of Star Wars must include The Phantom Menace.",StarWars,persistentInquiry,False,/r/StarWars/comments/i132zx/cooperation_midichlorians_and_why_the_phantom/
15,Origin of the Lobot Soundboard?,1596178422,"Back before Disney took the helm, the Star Wars website used to have a soundboard with a ton of random, extremely specific effects (Trandoshans, Gonk Torture‚Ñ¢, etc.) along with several clips for most characters from the OT/PT/TCW.

31,Wild Speculation: I don‚Äôt think Lucasfilm story group planned on Ben dying in 9.,1596169647,"
I truly believe Lucasfilm did not intend or plan for him to die. JJ signed onto 9 with the condition that he didn‚Äôt need approval from the story group. Prior to TROS being released, they put out a ton of books, comics, etc that made us sympathetic towards Ben Solo and planted a lot of seeds. For instance, in one of the Star Wars comics Leia finds Padme‚Äôs old dresses and thinks about how she‚Äôd love to pass some of those along to her own daughter or granddaughter one day. In Last Shot and others, there‚Äôs a lot about potential etc that others see in Ben. Hell, even Rian said (pre 9 release) he didn‚Äôt see what the point in killing Ben if they‚Äôre bothering to put all the character development into him.

They have also been very tight lipped since TROS about him, and Matt Martin etc has hinted at him not being ‚Äúreally‚Äù gone. I honestly feel like they‚Äôre trying to work around what JJ did, which was basically killing the cash cow character and all interest in post TROS stories.

There‚Äôs a lot of argument that he needed to die because he did bad things. You could argue the same about Luke blowing up the Death Star? Star Wars has always been stories that deal with human exaggerated tenfold. Lucas said that Vader and Luke was similar to a Father coming back from war to his son his son grown, having trouble connecting. All SW characters kill tons of people like it‚Äôs nothing, etc... Kylo killing Han is an exaggerated version of rebelling against ones father. 

Just saying, I don‚Äôt think the ‚Äúbut he NEEEEDS to die‚Äù really ever worked for Star Wars. Anakin died because he lived a full life, and had completed an arc, etc... Ben had characters sacrifice themselves FOR him so that he would have a chance to live a happy life. 

He gets happiness for 10 seconds, and JJ took the easy way out and killed him. He could have lived and found a way to repent. Whether it was living alone and helping others, or maybe finding a way to right his wrong and carry on his family legacy that he finally embraces. 

The story group would normally just point out ‚Äúyes he‚Äôs dead, see end of ep9‚Äù. But they have been incredibly picky with wording when talking or answering questions on the topic. And Pablo Hidalgo, Matt Martin, etc have all made it extremely clear they did not like the direction Ep7 went by doing the third Death Star or how 9 went at all. Justin Bolger, head of branding, also hates 9. It‚Äôs super interesting to see them loving these books, comics, etc that all have pieces and backstory for Kylo, yet they are adamantly against TROS. Pablo in particular, very much despises JJ for going over their heads it seems.

Lucas came up with the idea of Han and Leia‚Äôs son going dark over the course of the sequels per the art books. He also came up with the nobody girl strong in the force finding Luke in self exile. While it‚Äôs not printed, I am sure that George‚Äôs ‚Äúending‚Äù he had in mind was not ‚Äúyeah let‚Äôs just kill the Skywalker kid‚Äù. I‚Äôm sure a lot is just random conjecture, but I genuinely believe JJ purposefully signed onto 9 with the condition he could do everything at Bad Robot without needing to consult the story group because he knocked heads with them on 7 so much. There are so many artists from LFL that say things like ‚ÄúJJ just threw out original ideas and designs because he didn‚Äôt think they were recognizable as Star Wars‚Äù. In fact, in the TROS art book, someone said JJ didn‚Äôt think a double bladed saber made sense for Rey because people would think of Darth Maul...

Anyway, not sure why they were putting out so much about Kylo/Ben previously and building his character, and radio silence since TROS came out. The making of book, as well as the Kylo Ren book announced after TLJ came out, have been delayed indefinitely it seems.",StarWars,kidwifi,False,/r/StarWars/comments/i115vi/wild_speculation_i_dont_think_lucasfilm_story/

77,Fanfiction Writer?,1596154266,"Hello there! So I'm thinking about writing a series of star wars fanfictions. It's like a what if series of if a certain circumstance occurs or something changes in the future. I want to write them, but I would appreciate it if I had a co-writer to help me. Here's a few ideas I'm thinking about writing

&amp;#x200B;

The way I'm starting off this series is that basically Vader kills Luke a little TOO late and Luke ends up dying. Vader can't take the pain of losing another person he loves, and decides to somehow go in time and bring Luke back. When he does this, it breaks time and the universe tries to fix itself with mismatched puzzle pieces (figurately of course) so things change. 

&amp;#x200B;

Luke Palpatine au: A alternate universe where Luke was kidnapped by Palpatine as a baby and raised to become Darth Vader. Anakin doesn't turn to the dark side. Since Palpatine's plan failed, he hides away and raises Luke. I think it would be interesting because instead of Luke trying to turn Vader to the dark side, Anakin wants to turn (the son he knew nothing about) to the light.

&amp;#x200B;

Another is a alternate universe where Leia is the farmgirl on Tatooine while Luke is the Prince of Alderann. There's gonna be a BIG change however it's not gonna be exactly like the original trilogy.

However half way through the first episode I stopped. The reason is that The Mandalorian is first presented to us as a top Bounty Hunter who had captured all of his marks. Most series don‚Äôt have a main character who is extremely powerful because the people reading/watching need to learn about the world, usually through a more experienced character. Examples are Obi-Wan to Luke, Qui-Gon and to a lesser extent Obi-Wan to Anakin, Gandalf for the Hobbits. Even with series like the Clone Wars, none of the main characters are presented as the strongest in their story as Sidious looms over everything. The problem with the Mandalorian is that he is presented as a strong character at first, only to immediately almost die, then fail to ride a random animal. That sets him up with his/our guide into his new adventure, but immediately nerfs him half-way through the first episode.",StarWars,Baconator981,False,/r/StarWars/comments/i0wbkt/why_i_dont_like_the_mandalorian/

That perfectly sums up the reason why this didn't happen (even though it would have been really cool.)

 Some good comparisons of this would be if in ROTJ Luke almost gets killed by the emperor, and suddenly Obi Wan comes in and kills both Sheev and vader.

13,Will time be kind to the Sequel Trilogy? How will it be viewed 10 years from now?,1596147062,"Despite my major issues with the ST, I believe the future of Star Wars is very bright. The shows have been doing very well, we're finally getting some good video games, and they got a talented director in Taika Waititi to helm the next film. I also think it's a safe bet that Disney/LF are aware of the mistakes they made with the ST in terms of how it was planned out (or lack thereof) and will handle the next set of films with more care as a result of that. But I think that brings me to my point.

The ST is already divisive as is, and many people, including some who enjoyed it, have pointed out the issues it has. So if we get new Star Wars films that are way better planned and tell more focused and consistent stories, will that only make the Sequel Trilogy look even worse in retrospect?

Time has been kinder to the Prequels, but I think a large part of that is due to how the poorly planned out and unfocused narrative of the Sequels, really honed in on the fact that the Prequels, despite their issues, had a consistent vision. Also because the Sequels didn't add a whole lot of new ideas and concepts to the setting, I think it helped people appreciate how much more was added to Star Wars with the Prequels. Episodes I-III added so much in terms of locations, cultures, lore, and perspectives. Some of the best Star Wars material probably wouldn't exist if it weren't for the Prequels, like Clone Wars or KotoR. Whereas the Sequels only tread familiar ground with Empire vs. Rebels.

Years from now, I don't think people who disliked or felt indifferent toward the Sequels, will have a newfound appreciation for them. They didn't add much to the setting. Arguably it took some things away from it with how it diminished the accomplishments of the OT heroes. And the lack of planning will only become more apparent as time goes on.

In the first scene, he kills the informant in cold blood after revealing the death star plans. I think it would be great if the TV series explained how he became a morally corrupt character prior to rogue one. 

I've kinda got it in my head that it will be shot in a similar style to True detectives season 1. It could be tense and uncomfortable but with loveable and flawed characters. Exposing the dark underbelly of espionage. 

I'm not sure how much would be achievable under Disney's watchful eye. But I think it would be a really cool avenue to explore.

Rogue One: hexa ass kick (1 point for Eadu, 2 for the heavy casualties in Jheda City, 3 for Scarif). Scarif is the perfect example of what I mean. The imperials were heavily outnumbering the rebels, yet they got mowed down by the dozens and for each dead rebel, there were like 20 dead Stormtroopers. And don't even start with that Star Destroyer scene. It looked bad ass, but seriously, a few Y-Wings can do that? Why was the battle above Endor such a problem then?

Alright, next one. Episode IV: One small victory, one gigantic ass kick (Yeah, the escape from the Death Star was planned, but subsequently destruction most likely wasn't)

Episode V: One big win for Hoth and a half for Bespin (They might have conquered the city, but the heroes escaped)

Episode VI: Hepta ass kick. One for Vader's death, one for Palpatine's, one for the second Death Star and three for the defeat by teddy bears. No, no... make it four, because of Palpatine tooting about how the best of the best have been stationed on Endor.

And the same goes for video games. Dark Forces: Ass kick, although I have to give them some slack here, because they fought against god. Anyway, Jedi Fallen Order: Ass kick. The Force Unleashed 1&amp;2: Ass kick, Roque Squadron: Ass kick. Battlefront 2 Classic: Ass... oh wait, they actually kicked ass for a change, yet still didn't manage to reach their ultimate goal.

I was just thinking of how much they could do with it. Maybe make it in the Star Wars: Fallen Order style, which I think would work very well. They could also add on to stuff like they did in SW:EI:O-W to flesh out parts of the story.... You know explain how Jar Jar was a secrete Sith Lord, all that.

We also know from a deleted scene in Attack of the Clones that Padme still had parents (don't watch Clone Wars so not sure if they make an appearance there).

The thing that works about 'the force' in the first two films is how intangible it is.

That's what makes it so interesting.

You can't call it up, because you still have two slots left on a 5th level.

It always has to do with the characters as well, as they manifest force powers.  It's a pivotal and dramatic moment.

In the first couple films, people can only tap into 'the force' when 'all is lost', to accomplish a goal dear to them.

That's a powerful idea.

ANH: Despite some of the Cringey dialogues i enjoyed this and Mark Hamill was great in Hooking me up with the story. 

ESB: Awesome and not only the best star wars movie but one of the best movies i have seen. The Twist was ruined for me before i even started watching these movies

ROTJ:Jabba stuff was meh but overall i enjoyed this more than the New Hope because of Vader and Luke. 

Phantom menace : Dull,Terribly acted and boring af. 

AOTC: Worst of the Franchise 

ROTS: Really Underrated and despite Anakin being the bad guy i absolutely loved him 

TFA: Absolutely love this movie.The Dynamic b/w Kylo n Rey is great. Kylo Ren is my favorite Star Wars character.

TLJ: The first Hour n a Half is not that good and hated the subplot b/w Finn n Rose. But the Ending was Terrific.Overall A Fine Movie. 

TROS: Thought it was fine on the first watch but re-watched it Bcoz of rey n Kylo and really like it. 
The Whole scene of them fighting on the Death Star and then Han Solo coming in is probably my favorite Scene of the Franchise.

Overall, the movies are good and i did enjoy them.

If you watch those movies again, they stand naked, without being able to lean on their meta-commentary or shock moments. 

People remember that ESB was shocking, but they also forget that it was subversive too. The standard revenge mission was upended in favor of family drama. 

ROTJ had its shock, but it gets lost in the haze of Ewoks, brother/sister relationships, and familiarity. No one expected Vader to turn. Now, we're just used to it. 

There's just ""the story"" now for those two films. 

Today, they're forced to stand on their own merits. 

And we see how that shook out, over decades. 

The ST films are recent. Too recent to judge in terms of how each film will stand on its own merits. 

I wonder, where will it all stand, ten years from now, when Star Wars has a new face, and the idea of Luke Skywalker becoming a tragic figure is no longer shocking, but is merely just accepted. Where will it stand with Snoke's sudden death being relegated to simply something that happened in the movie?

I have learned enough to keep up a conversation and be a good girlfriend lol, but it‚Äôs not really my thing to get into. 

Anyway, I‚Äôd like to throw him a surprise party that‚Äôs all Star Wars themed. If anyone could give me some tips on what to include? 

My thoughts so far are:
-Blue &amp; green milk station
-An ‚Äòintergalactic‚Äô photo booth with character cutouts &amp; quotes
-themed snacks (princess lays, light saber pretzel rods, Han burgers, etc...)

And that‚Äôs about where it ends üôÉ

1,Is there any correlation between Clone Trooper Armor and Rank?,1596055347,"Something that's recently come to mind; with every Clone Commanders/Captains throughout the series, there has been plenty of inconsistencies with the armor they wear in relation to their rankings.

For example, despite being Commanders, Appo and (Fallen Order spoilers?) the unnamed commander who aimed at Jaro Tapal, wore armor of a normal Clone. Meanwhile Rex, who was a Captain throughout the majority of Clone Wars, was decked out in his (at least what I believe to be) ARC Trooper armor. It just seems weird knowing that Appo was ranked higher than Rex in the 501st, all the while Appo looked like any other trooper, while Rex obviously stands out.

But then compare Appo to Cody, who at least has a different helmet from most clones. And then when Vaughn was promoted to captain, he wore a similar build helmet to Cody, a commander.

I guess I'm answering my own question in saying that there is no correlation - was there ever supposed to be? Again, it just seems so weird to me.",StarWars,tomahtotome,False,/r/StarWars/comments/i08bbc/is_there_any_correlation_between_clone_trooper/

24,Why I don't think Rebels and TCW should be compared to each other.,1596050462,"Just saying, I dislike neither show. They both have incredible moments. 

I always see TCW and Rebels being compared, and while I think one can enjoy one of the series more than the other, I don't think the two shows themselves can be compared on things such as visual appeal, the characters and other content apart from things like the score and possibly maturity. 

Reason 1: The funding.

TCW received ~1.4 Million per episode on average. This is an estimate, as I found out that Lucas himself said in 2008 that each episode of TCW would receive ~$1 million, but the Clone Wars movie lasting 98 minutes had a budget of $8.5 million. The average Clone Wars episode is roughly 20 minutes or so not including credits, and roughly it equates to $1.7 million per 20 minutes. 

Rebels has no official figures but the general guess seems to be around $200 - 500 thousand, so I'll put it at $350,000 per episode. This equates to 20.5% of the budget for TCW. 

Apparently, animation equipment gets cheaper over time, but I can't find any estimation as to how much, so let's reduce Rebels to having exactly a quarter of the budget of TCW. Very unfair to compare two shows with such uneven funding.

Reason 2: The themes of the shows

TCW is arguably more mature due to it not having the restrictions that Rebels endured due to it being on DisneyXD. It deals with the themes of large scale war, and the trauma of it, and the humanization of beings who were created to be a faceless army. It also deals with comraderie, loss, and friendship; the list goes on. 

Rebels in comparison, pushes the themes of family, friendship, growth and also loss - but at a much smaller level. Definitely a more child oriented narrative, but also a completely different set of themes for a completely different show. 

Reason 3: The content of the shows, mainly a response to the criticism of Rebels that 'no one ever dies in it'. 

TCW, as I'm sure many of you know, focuses on the Republic vs the CIS. Two massive armies, no doubt with thousands of casualties on either side by the day showing the atrocities of large scale war. Many fairly minor characters are killed. The show jumps around a lot, focusing on a lot of different characters which has its fair share of good and bad. As such, we see lots of characters who are mostly nameless Clones that are no more than background or filler killed. A few we see for 1 - 4 episodes, but have no large sense of attachment to. 

Rebels focuses exclusively on the *Ghost* crew and a small circle of Rebels they operate with. In comparison to the Republic, the Rebels number very few against the might of the glorious Empire, so very few characters we get to know (or don't know) die, simply because the show doesn't cover nearly as many characters as TCW does, which also is debatable good/bad. 

Reason 4: Time of release

Seasons 1 to 2 would be fine to be compared to earlier seasons of Rebels as I think the difference in time between when the shows are released offset the improvements in animation quality. Season 3 and 4 of Rebels can be compared to 3 - 6 of TCW though, as both look equally good. TCW season 7 shouldn't be compared to any other part of TCW or Rebels due to its vastly increased funding (no exact official figures) and that it was also made after the rest of both shows by a considerable amount. 

Reason 5: Preference of artstyle/nostalgia

As TCW was released first, everyone would take a while to get used to the Rebels artstyle, or even refuse to watch it completely based on it. Even though I watched the series' only weeks apart, it still took some time to get used to, and at first I didn't even want to watch it because of the different artstyle that I thought at the time was ugly. 

Nostalgia is also a factor, as the majority of the current fanbase grew up with either 2003 Clone Wars or 2008 Clone Wars, and so hold a special place in their heart for either one. This isn't bad in itself, but causes the series to be viewed with rose-tinted glasses, and there are much, much fewer fans in the fanbase to counteract this who have grown up with Rebels, probably because they aren't that old yet. 

Reason 6: Length of the shows

TCW was 133 episodes long, compared to Rebels 74. This disadvantaged TCW as it had to have more filler episodes, which Rebels had comparatively few of. It did also give way for more highs in TCW, which did have a lot more good moments than Rebels. 

Verdict: I talked too much. It's too late. But both shows shouldn't be compared show-to-show in my opinion, unless it is just a simple matter of 'I enjoyed x better than y' but a statement like 'No one died in Rebels compared to TCW so it is less mature and by extension worse' just feels a bit off for me.

20,Lightsaber Colours,1596015699,"So, a lot of people have been wondering about lightsaber colours and what they actually mean, so I just wanted to make a post about it and share my knowledge, I think(and hope!) that most of these are true and make sense.


Blue - the most common lightsaber colour used by Jedi such as Obi-Wan and Anakin represents Jedi Guardians, basically the soldiers of the Republic and the ones that do the most fighting.


Green - the second most common lightsaber colour represents Jedi Consulars which are basically the non-violent part of the Republic(diplomats, healers, seers and lore keepers etc.)


Red - this colour is caused by the Sith‚Äôs use of synthetic Kyber crystals and ‚Äòbleeding them by pouring negative, dark side emotions(e.g. rage, hate, fear and pain) and also because red is associated with evil.


Yellow - a very rare lightsaber colour, this represents Jedi Sentinels, the Jedi that work with technology, espionage and sabotage(splicers, Jedi shadows, tech experts etc.)

Note that Rey makes a lightsaber that has a yellow blade and I think this is because she is a scavenger and that because of that she has a background in technology?

Also temple guards have lightsabers of this colour but of a lighter shade.


White - This is caused by healing a bled, red kyber crystal, which causes it to turn white(which Ashoka does in Star Wars Rebels).

Purple - there are a lot of explanations for this one:

Purple is symbolic which indicates that the person wielding the saber had studied multiple lightsaber forms(including those of the sith).
Basically a combination of blue(good) and red(bad) which makes purple.

There is only one wielder of a purple lightsaber that we have seen and that is Mace Windu, he has learnt many lightsaber forms and he uses a variant of form seven(which is a sith form) called vaapad(which he developed himself).

Also because Jackson wanted his daughter to recognise when he was on the screen so he wanted a unique colour.


Black - this is the colour of the darksaber, made by a mandalorian who was a former Jedi which was passed from person to person through murder.


Some Jedi also have blue, green or yellow lightsabers that are slightly darker or lighter shades.

Kylo would never work for another Evil force user he could've killed palpatine and took his stuff. 

Rian Johnson set kylo up as irredeemable. He rejected the light side multiple times from his dad, rey and luke. He was evil by Choice he was doing it for selfish reasons Vader did it for love. They're completely different. 

Reys parents aren't nobody's because if they're related to palpatine that makes her parents important by being related to palpatine, and makes rey someone of importance. Cuz she's the granddaughter a sith lord not a nobody.

Luke said she knew she was a palpatine all along why didn't he try to find her if he and leia knew someone like that existed and that any potential sith followers could've turned her? 

Why didn't people rise up after Luke's death? 

This will be the spark that lights the rebellion that'll burn the first order down 

This is clear set up for an introduction of a new jedi order as luke says the jedi order is reborn today why is there no time skip to establish a new jedi order? 

What about kylo If he hates the past why is the first order still intact and nothing significantly changed like making a new interpretation of evil force users that are completely detached from sith

 The failures of The jedi order in The prequels have Nothing to do The jedi philosophy, it is about The individual inside of it that lost sight of their goal and propose. 


There is also a huge misconsception like The idea that they are more powerful because they can use both The light and The dark. wrong, while they do not reconize The idea of dark and light side of The force . they DO believe The Force is a force for good against chaos. They believe that evil must be fought but unlike The jedi they acknowledge that evil is a natural cycle of life and cannot be exterminated.


While i do believe their philosophy Is interesting LEGENDS  showed The flaws of a grey jedi teachings. In both canon and Legends Luke's new order proved far less stable and created far more dark side users than The old one...it reach a point when like himself began to question his own teachings

44,A theory involving with Anakin and the Lars family.,1595976057,"In Episode 2 of Star Wars, Anakin Skywalker brings his mothers corpse back to Cliegg Lars and his son Owen and his girlfriend Beru . With the look that he gives Cliegg and Owen a look of what I can only describe as pure hatred, i argue that Anakin could believe that The Lars‚Äô didn‚Äôt do enough to save Schmi from the Tusken Raiders. I believe a very strong reason for why he could hate them is jealously, Anakin could have been jealous that Schmi moved on from his departure and in Anakins eyes, moved past him with a new family, a family that couldn‚Äôt even save her from her fate. I really think from that moment on he hated the Lars‚Äô and that leads into a theory I have that Vader ordered the deaths of Owen and Beru.

The theory goes as follows, Anakin left the Lars, knowing that he shouldn‚Äôt lash out due to Padme being present and him still being a Jedi and believing in good. He then let the thoughts of the Lars‚Äô and his hatred going to the back of his mind, essentially forgetting them. Fast forward to the apprehension of Owen and Beru, the stormtroopers didn‚Äôt need to kill the Lars, they just needed to apprehend them. However, what if the troopers addressed Vader, saying they found the people who had purchased the stolen droids and seemingly were hiding them, perhaps Vader asked of their names and when receiving them was infuriated, knowing that the Lars family was again interfering negatively with his life, he ordered their instant execution.

48,I wish that TCW had been able to show more non clone organics fighting and leading armies like the Clone Wars MMO had.,1595975607,"""Heroes on both sides"" That is what the opening crawl to EP 3 told us but aside from the really really good episode where Ahsoka goes with Padme to see her friend on the seperatist council it doesn't really feel like we got to see that very much in The Clone Wars. We did get the Anakin led insurrection on Onderon as well. But they were just drops in the bucket.  And we have a lot of characters who's backstories are that they served for the GAR in the clone wars either as boots on the ground or in command of ships and people. 

In the [Clone Wars Multi Media Project] (https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Wars_multimedia_project) aka the books and comics and Tartakovsky CW show that came out about the war prior to The Clone Wars we got to see a lot of humans serving in the GAR and a lot of different CIS species serving as commanders and admirals and agents in the CIS droid army. In Jedi Trial for example its a Muun who is leading the droid army. 

Eckharts ladder even [did a good video on some of the battles between organics during the war] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtP7m14w2eo&amp;t=147s) 

Other than Admirals Tarkin and Yularen their seems to be no other organic commanders or troopers in the GAR that aren't clones or Jedi. 

Same for the CIS. After the first season it is basically just the OOM droids leading the armies and piloting the ships. We have a few people like Lok Durd who was only in one episode. Loathsome is at least in two but they are also all in the first season.  Mar  Tuuk also one episode also first season. Trench at least got another appearance in the last season but it seems like after season one its just about all OOM's

Now its not TCW's fault. The OOM's save a lot of money on having to create new and unique characters and animate them moving and talking and all of that. So their are a lot more the comics and books can do that the series couldn't due to money. Plus not all of the show was focused on the armies and who was leading or fighting in them, we mostly say clones because we were with jedi generals on the battlefield and the clones were major characters. 

I just wish that like the MMP we had gotten to see a little bit more of the organics on each side of the war. Its fine for characters to have ""fought in the clone wars"" in their background but the way TCW makes it seem that feels more to be the outlier.",StarWars,TheMastersSkywalker,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hzonc6/i_wish_that_tcw_had_been_able_to_show_more_non/
49,Was Jacen Solo Redeemed?,1595975430,"I just finished the Legacy of the Force book series, which detailed Jacen Solo's turn to the dark side and transformation into the Sith Lord Darth Caedus.

In his last moments as his sister was about to cut him down, instead of taking the chance to kill Jaina and avenging himself, which he could have done, he instead sent out a last scream, a warning, through the Force. 

His last act was to warn Tenel Ka that she and his daughter were in immenent danger from a nano killer set to target their biological signature, which would have killed them had he not sent the warning out. His daughter and lover both survived due to the warning he sent. 

In the book, it was not detailed whether or not that last act would have redeemed him. Do you think that, in saving Tenel Ka and his daughter instead of killing Jaina, that he was redeemed in the Force, and died as Jacen Solo instead of Darth Caedus?",StarWars,H0tSquid,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hzolf8/was_jacen_solo_redeemed/

3,The Mandalorian Season II,1595963017,"I wanted to make this post for all of the fans of The Mandalorian in the UK and any other countries that this applies to, WELL in advance of the Season 2 release, in the hopes we can actually make this happen.

When The Mandalorian first dropped onto Disney+ in the US in November 12th 2019, it was in the US only. The instant popularity of the show of course filled Reddit with spoilers, memes, fan theories and more effectively spoiling the experience for UK fans. 
This is because the UK didn‚Äôt even get Disney+ until March 24th 2020, and even then we only got the first 2 episodes releasing the rest an episode a week as it was during first release in the US. 

Now, I‚Äôm not brain dead. I understand that Disney do this so you don‚Äôt sign up for the free trial, binge watch all the good stuff and then cancel your trial before you have to pay. But to get to my point.

Given that Disney+ as a streaming service, is now live and available to stream in the US, Canada, the Netherlands, Australia, New Zealand, Puerto Rico, Austria, Germany, Ireland, Italy, France, Spain, Switzerland, India, and the UK. I think it is only fair, that Star Wars and Mandalorian fans in EVERY one of those countries should be able to view each episode of The Mandalorian Season 2, as it releases to the Disney+ service.

I don‚Äôt know how you‚Äôd be able to eliminate the freeloaders that way, but I‚Äôm pretty sure Disney have enough money to hire some clever people to come up with a way. 

I have hope that Reddit can make this happen. Hope is all the fans have, but look at what hope can achieve!

28,Can we patch up the sequels I‚Äôm the same way the prequels were by clone wars?,1595958457,"I actually don‚Äôt hate the sequels nearly as much as the average but I have to admit nine left me feeling much more sour. I wondered for a while if there would be a way to do what was done for the prequels with the clone wars by fleshing out things more and explaining. I‚Äôd be open to any ideas but as much as I personally like the sequel movies individually more than the prequels I believe that the prequels end up being a more solid trilogy in terms of overall story structure. 

I had an idea today that is pretty out there and may just honestly not be that great but the more I think about it the more I like it. What I would want to be done is if want breadcrumbs obviously about sidious and such but however I would borrow from legends and I would make it so the true puppeteer was actually abeloth. Although she wasn‚Äôt handled the greatest in the old eu I think the idea is decent and could most definitely be a breath of fresh air because it‚Äôs a different sort of threat. 

I would essentially make it so that through influencing the force abeloth is what allowed a sidious clone to actually use the force as that was not really possible in the prequels with clones afaik, you could also make it what allowed Rey to be born and would pay into an idea about how to handle everyone complaining about Rey being a Mary sure which admittedly is kind of true at times. This is because I‚Äôm old canon clones could not reproduce. You could chalk this up to the clone and her mother being incredibly happy and thinking it was a miracle.

I‚Äôd make it so that the sequels play out as they do because Rey is being subtlety pushed by abeloth and fueled by her. Abeloth I‚Äôm old canon could only be taken down by a combined effort of jedi and sith. To aid in her return taking out both factions and leaving them handicapped aside from Rey who is her thrall slightly. 

Through this you could bring back anakin as perhaps Luke noticed something was off and did in fact die and become one with the force because while connecting on that level he heard anakin for one of the first times and he needed his help but in order to reach him he had to become one and he felt it was his time. This allows Luke to eventually discover what is happening and perhaps help anakin get free.

You could make it so that since she‚Äôs essentially and eldritch entity that she could exist in the living force in a weird dimension (I read to many comics) this was kinda the case in old eu but different as she had kinda pseudo bodies like darkseid. They could find this out and launch a coordinated attack, one on the material abeloth and one on the living force abeloth. You could give Rey her due by allowing her to get the final hit on abeloth in reality as anakin destroys her immaterial form with the help of other spectres.

I don‚Äôt know I literally thought all this up in about 15 minutes but I‚Äôm curious what anyone else thinks would be good ideas?

60,Why Ben Solo turned to the Dark Side: an organized investigation,1595908620,"It seems a lot of people have trouble understanding Kylo's motivation and why it's so compelling, so I've made a brief breakdown:


I've tried to organize certain concepts to make them easier to track across this analysis. I wish I could use coloured text but alas.
These themes are:



.

*Luke's fear*

**Kylo's perception**

~~Luke's failure~~

##Luke's legend


.


Now, onto the breakdown

###Ben's point of view: 


* ##Luke is the paragon of the Light Side way of life, he is The jedi above all other jedi.


* Luke attempts to murder his young nephew in his sleep. 


* Luke is evil therefore **the Light Side is evil.**


* **The Light Side is evil,** therefore its opposite, the Dark Side, must be good.


* Luke taught that the Dark Side was a cancer to the Force, therefore the Light Side must be the **corruption** of the true nature of the Force.


* Kylo must not fall to the **seductive manipulation** of the Light Side. Even if that means killing his own father, who has tragically fallen prey to that **corruptive** power.



###Reality:


* Luke is a paragon of the Light Side but he is not without flaws, and his *fear* has always been his greatest weakness as a Jedi.


* It is this *fear*, which the Dark Side feeds on and nurtures within his mind, that drives him to read Ben's mind in his sleep.


* Within, he sees a vision of Ben slaughtering his entire school of students, killing his friends and family, becoming the next Vader, etc.


* Luke succumbs to this *fear* ~~""for the briefest moment of pure instinct""~~, much like when ~~he held his blade to his father with intent to kill~~ on the second Death Star.


* ~~This moment~~ passes ""like a fleeting shadow"", as it did in RotJ, after which Luke makes the ultimate statement of pacifism, tossing his lightsaber away in defiance of the Emperor and refusing to perpetuate the cycle of violence which destroyed his father's life.


* However, this time, that ~~brief moment of dark intent~~ has **consequences**: Ben sees Luke's blade active and assumes the worst (see **Ben's point of view** above).


* The Light Side is good, it lives in harmony with nature and is the true nature of the Force. The Dark Side is like a cancer in the Force, it ultimately leads only to suffering. 


* Han must try to save his son's soul from the seductive manipulation of the Dark Side. Even if it means being killed by his own son, who has tragically fallen prey to that corruptive power.



That is what makes Kylo's story a tragedy, the dramatic irony of what **he's been lead to believe,** in contrast to what we know is true.

Yoda:
Luke! You must complete the training.


Luke:
*I can't keep that vision out of my head.* They're my friends. I've gotta help them.


Yoda:
You must not go!


Luke:
But *Han and Leia will die if I don't.*


Obi-Wan:
You don't know that. Even Yoda cannot see their¬†fate.


Luke:
But I can help them! 


[...]


Obi-Wan: This is a dangerous time for you, when you will be tempted by the Dark Side of the Force.
[...]
It is you and your abilities the Emperor wants. That is why your friends are made to suffer.


Luke:
That's why I have to go.


Yoda:
[...]If you end your training now, if you choose the quick and easy path as Vader did, you will become an agent of evil.


Obi-Wan: Patience!


Luke:
*And sacrifice Han and Leia?*


Yoda: If you honor what they fight for, yes!



###Return of the Jedi
Luke: There is still good in him.


[...]


Obi-Wan: You cannot escape your destiny. You must face Darth Vader again.


Luke: I can't kill my own father!


Obi-Wan: Your insight serves you well. *Bury your feelings deep down, Luke.* They do you credit, but ~~they could be made to serve the Emperor.~~




Vader:
You cannot hide forever, Luke.


Luke:
I will not fight you.


Vader:
*Give yourself to the dark side. It is the only way you can save your friends. Yes, your thoughts betray you. Your feelings for them are strong.* Especially for... [pauses] Sister! So, you have a twin sister. *Your feelings have now¬†betrayed her too.* Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. *If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will!*


Luke:

Kylo: **I'm being torn apart.** I want to be free of this pain. **I know what I have to do but I don't know if I have the strength to do it.** Will you help me?



###The Last Jedi
Luke: Leia blamed Snoke, but... it was me. ~~I failed.~~ 
##Because I was Luke Skywalker. Jedi Master. A legend.


Luke: I saw darkness. I sensed it building in him. I'd seen it in moments during his training. But then I looked inside, and it was beyond what I ever imagined. Snoke had already turned his heart. *He would bring destruction, pain, death, and the end of everything I love because of what he will become.* And for ~~the briefest moment of pure instinct,~~ I thought I could stop it.
