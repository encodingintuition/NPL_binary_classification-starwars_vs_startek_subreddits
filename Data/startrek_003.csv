Imagine how cool a TNG movie follow-up to Chain Of Command would’ve been. Gul Madred as the antagonist invading Bajor, could tie into DS9, maybe even bring back Jellico as a side role with an awesome redemption arc.

1,The Spock betrayal was such a let down,1594608365,"Michael builds up for several episodes that she did something unspeakably horrible to Spock.

""Your heart rate and perspiration are increased.""

And it turns out the mean, awful, very bad thing she did was... she said something mean to him once when they were kids. OMFG WHAT A MONSTER! And older sibling said something mean to a younger sibling. It gets even better, after the flashback Spock immediately says, ""Yeah, dude, I know you didn't mean it. You just wanted me to be detached from you to protect me physically. So, no biggie smalls."" She said it in an effort to protect him and he understood that. Jesus, what a let down that is.

Worse yet, it kind of reminds me of the 'words are violence' woke crowd which kind of disgusts me. I really just don't respect that cultural attitude or viewpoint at all.

Oh, and lastly, why does this show have to be a prequel. All they have to do is say it takes place in the 25th century, change the character names and races, boom, the show is 100% better.

3,Tom Paris,1594606701,"Apologies in advance if this has been brought up before (I'd be surprised if it hasn't) but what was up with Tom Paris?

Tom was Starfleet's bad boy, with this past full of bad stuff including joining the Maquis for a while, where he eventually gets arrested and Janeway drafts him out of prison.

But the actor, Robert Duncan McNeill, also played a Next Gen character (s5e19), a cadet at the academy named  Nicholas Locarno.  He also seemed to be a bad boy, got in trouble for an accident during a prohibited stunt maneuver with Nova Squadron and nearly got Wesley Crusher in trouble as well.  

Like Paris, Locarno also had a father in Starfleet, though I'm not sure what his rank was.

So if they resurrected the same character type, being played by the same actor, why not just bring the character back?   It even fits perfectly that he was a pilot.  I think it would have been pretty cool, and it seems like a wasted opportunity to me.  They could have easily said that after the Nova Squadron incident he was never truly accepted by Starfleet and this opened the door to him being recruited by the Maquis.",startrek,hiirogen,False,/r/startrek/comments/hq6yre/tom_paris/

Trip takes a bite with a not so thrilled look on his face and says “It tastes like resequenced protein.” 

This was prior to them going to that repair station after they hit the Romulan mine that had food replicators in the tables. Which other than T’Pol they have never seen that technology before nor does that Enterprise NX-01 have replicators. So what is the difference between resequenced protein and replicated food? What is resequenced protein anyway? Something found in like a field reaction pack? I always wonder every time I rewatch.

As we all probably know, the first trailer for Star Trek: Lower Decks just dropped.  In my opinion, it looks like a hoot - a fun, lighter fare romp through our favorite franchise.

Since the *Cerritos* is (probably) a homage to the kitbash starships of TNG and DS9, I was wondering if anybody has any favorite kitbashes from those eras.

My personal favorite is the Curry, which was seen in DS9 - [https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Uo4AVxoDwl4/maxresdefault.jpg](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Uo4AVxoDwl4/maxresdefault.jpg)

A mishmash of the Constitution and the Excelsior, it is an odd vessel overall, only appearing in a damaged fleet in its episode.  While it is a cruiser according to Eaglemoss' book, I always thought of the Curry as an escort carrier - a cheap, but multi-purpose starship that could do a variety of things for the war effort.

So do you guys have any favorite kitbash?  If you have one (or multiple), why?

40,Lower Decks features wishlist,1594573545,"As it sounds, various things I would like to see in Lower Decks, some of these points more major or minor than others.

* Non-plot conversations between crew to show personality and character. With this show being comedy and not having an ""end of the federation"" plot this could well be a given but I thought to include it anyway.
* Strike a good balance of making fun of certain Trek events and themes without overdoing it. A few meta jokes could be good, lampshading how they still don't know where the Whale Probe came from, crack jokes about brainless Vulcans, someone hating the song ""Faith of the Heart"" etc, but too many would quickly get tiring.
* Use the animated medium to it's full extent. More alien looking aliens, interesting gravity malfunctions that can't be done well in live action, damage to the ship that would wreak a studio model, that sort of thing. (Have yet to see that trailer that's been getting uploaded then blocked at warp 9 so this may have already been proven/disproven)
* Tendi the Orion girl (I'm assuming she's Orion) noticeably diverges from the Orions we've seen before. For a species as old as the pilot they've seen very little good development, and even relegated to sex scenes and jokes in the Kelvin movies, Tendi could avert this just by being a regular person rather than a trope. Maybe they could take it further by showing she has an interest in the Orion's ancient cultures akin to how some people greatly admire ancient Rome.
* On that note have the characters be more than just the stills we've been shown. The awkward looking Boimler who's most likely to be the butt of most jokes? Show his ambitions for joining Starfleet and the skills that got him here. The confident looking Mariner? Have that confidence bite her back in a mission and she learns something from it. Have the grumpy cat lady be wise and more than a meme. E.T.C. Just because it's comedy doesn't mean there's no character development.

Bashir has to struggle with the stupid decision to make him superman, and ultimately doesn't have any resolution to his character other than he finally gets to live out his teenage boy fantasy of banging a version of this girl he was obsessed with.

52,Just finished the DS9 finale,1594556098,"Such a good ending! I really want to talk about it so I'll post here. Sorry if this is rambling

Spoilers obviously. If there is such a thing for a 25 year old show ;)

- Super good finale. Super good ending. It reminded me of back when I used to read fantasy novels and I'd finish the whole series. The ending would be emotional. I'd be really sad that all the characters were ending that chapter of their lives, splitting up, and moving on. I wish more TV shows had good endings like that. If the viewer doesn't feel that kind of stuff during the finale, the show didn't do a good job. For example, Game Of Thrones had a pretty bland ending. In fact, the whole last season was bland, except for the Winterfell episode. I didn't feel that same kind of emotion watching its finale.
- The finale itself drew inspiration from a lot of other works. The fire caves storyline was very similar to the ending of Lord Of The Rings. Caves, fire, an important object, a person representing the good side, a person representing the evil side, a great evil that gets destroyed. The situation in the Founder's bunker reminded me of the movie Downfall, a German movie about the last days of WW2 in Hitler's bunker.
- It was unrealistic for the Founder to go from a totally genocidal person that's been hell-bent on destruction for decades, and was actively committing genocide a couple of seconds before her capture, to surrendering and admitting 100% wrongdoing. But you know, they did such a good job with it that I actually suspended my disbelief and enjoyed that plot twist.
- I liked the flashbacks they did for each character toward the end. I was very sad that Worf's flashbacks didn't have Jadzia at all, even old footage. Jadzia's dispute with Rick Berman must have been very severe if he ordered old footage of her not to be included in any finale shots at all.
- I really didn't like Dukat in season 6, but he ended up being such a good character in season 7. Confident, funny, a great leader, and his banter back and forth with Weyoun is hilarious.
- Weyoun was another fantastic character. He nailed the sycophantic, glib, silver tongued salesman personality type perfectly.
- I could pick apart a couple of unrealistic storylines about leaders of great nations walking around a space station with no security or paparazzi, transferring their powers to random successors with no ceremony, etc. But honestly, I love these characters so much, that it is easier than normal for me to suspend disbelief.

59,A late night theory of semantics in the Kelvin and Picard universes.,1594548138,"At the risk of diving into good/bad semantics,  (remember the 90s, when it was just about Trekkies v Trekkers and baldness vs toupees?) this video makes me think about why the future 30 years from TNG and the Kelvin timeline have so much sharper teeth and language -- and I think it's because of the increased militarization int he Kelvin timeline, and or curbing of scientific progress in the years following Data's death (ST: Picard).  I personally don't mind hearing swear words from adults and find it weird when kids use them, and this is why Picard I think, has issues with old trekkers.  In the 22nd century, the Kelvins encountered an unknown 23rd century Romulan weapon which travelled through dimensions and time and completely outclassed them in a manner of combat that seems to have evolved somewhere possibly outside Federation space, where there areh more Star Wars-style dogfights. In  the future that Picard lives in, a similar, much more shocking event happened -- the banning of synths after the Romulan Lufthansa. What if those events, along with the Dominion, instilled some sense in humans (and other lifeforms less beholden to Surak's philosophy of logic) to embrace the language people used before pre-World War III, even if it didn't make sense, it still made how people felt clear -- and in the language of drama, feelings are essential as facts.  The Discovery-era had something closer the the language of TNG, with the exceptions of a few rough and tumble Starfleet engineers and Ensigns. I'm looking at you Tilly and Tig Notaro! Either way, I assume the Vulcans as well as Romulans and maybe even Klingons, are probably thinking or saying to each other, ""These hewmans be some kind of phase?""

76,"New Trekkie here, finished watching TOS Series + Films and finally super excited to share my opinion",1594518656,"(Sorry for the long post)  


**Lil' Backstory:**

I am a hugeee Sci-fi fan. Love and watched all SWs, Dr Who (nothing special there) and most of popular sci-fi shows and movies but for some reason Star Trek was the only popular sci-fi show that i never watched, not because I didn't want to but because the huge scale of the Star Trek universe always made me kinda uncomfortable as I didn't know where to start. So I kept postponing till i figured it all out and after years and years I finally decided to start the research on Star Trek Universe. I went through quite a few Star Trek forums, reddit posts and was still kinda conflicted on the watch order.  
Different Watch Order Opinions I came across:

\-&gt; Most popular opinion seemed to be, to start with TNG as its newer and then watch TOS (as it tends to be slow and tech used to be old as its from 60s) and  then rest of em in any or released order  
\-&gt; Someone suggested to watch a specific episode of TNG then start from the beginning of TNG to get you hooked and then watch DS9 and remaining in any order  
\-&gt; Some said to ignore TOS, some suggested to ignore Voyager   
\-&gt; Some said DS9 is the best so to start with that  
\-&gt; and finally there were some who said to watch in the original released order starting with TOS 

Obviously I was more confused than when I began this research, but finally I decided to start with TOS as I don't care about what decade it is from as long as its good, I do enjoy old movies, the tech def doesn't bother me as I judge it based on the tech available then.  


I finally finished watching TOS Series a while ago but was waiting to watch all films to share my opinion with you guys before I moved onto the next Star Trek series.

**TOS Series Impressions:** 

I REALLY LOVEEED IT!!! 

I started with ""The Cage"" episode and was kinda surprised to not see Captain Kirk and remember thinking this main actor is too good looking to be the lead here (no homo), anyway I really liked that episode and got hooked (Later read the story about how the actor who played Captain Pike left and William Shatner replaced him). I kept watching one or 2 episodes a day and the more I watched it, the more I loved it, I was soo surprised at some of the stories they came up with, some were mind-blowing, some were entertaining but at the same time some were too cheesy and weird but overall they were more good ones than bad and almost all of them were enjoyable and I couldn't help but wonder how far advanced this show must have been for its time, they predicted so many future tech like Mobile Phones, Virutal Conferences, 3D Printing and many more i can't think of right now. I also wonder if they predicted future tech or the tech exists because of Trek? We will know its the latter if we make ""The warp drive"" and ""Transporter"" in the next couple of centuries :p

  
**TOS Movies Impressions:** 

First impression about the movies is the graphics got much better, and I liked the first movie concept that the voyager we sent came back looking for us but I absolutely hated the new uniforms... YUCK!  
Wrath of the Khan and Voyage Home gotta be my fav movies of the list and for sure The final frontier was my least fav.   
Overall I am glad that they did movies over a decade after the series as I was able to see them grow old and move on from the Enterprise.  
Besides the story and the tech, I loved each and every character in their own way. And the casting director was amazing as I can't imagine these characters being played by other people (not considering Kelvin timeline ofcourse)  
**Captain Kirk** \- He is the real leader, in the sense that he is ready to make hard decisions at difficult times but also not afraid to give his life to save others.  
**Spock** \- I don't think anything needs to be said, spock is spock, smart, talented, ability to think objectively but also showing his human side when needed and much much more...  
**Dr. Mc Coy** \- AKA Bones, he is my fav character on the show, especially love his dialogues ""I am Doctor, not a ....."" or ""He is dead, Jim"" or ""......., JIM"". His and Spock's convos are THE BEST.  
**Scotty:** Took me a while to like scotty but oh boy can he drink  
**Uhura, Sulu, Chekov:** Loved the roles they played and also gotta appreciate the show once more to hire a black woman and an asian person in the 60s to show that in the future none of that matters we are all one. (representation matters)

That brings me to another huge thing I loved about the Trek Universe is that, in the 23rd century people use their time and talents to explore the universe, study and research sciences, and create art and not worry about stupid things like money or race etc. That sounds like true Utopia to me. I surely wish that One day we all collectively achieve that.

&amp;#x200B;

So what are you guys's first impressions of TOS? Loved it or Hated it?   
also it's time for me to start watching TNG, so what can i expect from TNG? or should i just go in without any expectations like the first one? 

Looking forward to reading your opinions.

79,On non-professional actors and SAG rules,1594512170,"Star Trek is one of those famous, influential shows that people ask to be on as a way of paying back the influence.

She had prestige enough that they created the role of Guinan for her (making Patrick Stewart insecure that an Academy Award winner would be playing opposite him!)

Through the years, not just professional actors, but even influential people from other professions have obtained guest star credits. I remember a news report that Jordan's King Abdullah was an extra in a Voyager corridor scene, talking to Harry Kim. The article took special note that Abdullah was not a SAG member, so he couldn't have any lines on screen.

Other examples: Professor Stephen Hawking and Mae Jemison (the first black female astronaut in history) both had appearances on TNG, and both had speaking lines. All of a sudden I'm curious why they both could speak on screen when Abdullah couldn't. Why could they make SAG exceptions for a professor and an astronaut, but not for royalty?

In Hawking's case my first thought was that SAG could make an exception for a person who plays himself. (Or perhaps they could wink and nudge and claim that he wasn't actually speaking, but using a prop that spoke.)

83,Long Time Star Trek Fan Finally Watches DS9: Season 7 episodes 19-21,1594509795,"Strange Bedfellows: ew kanar is THICK. 

Worf and Ezri are not fighting like a married couple anymore. They are fighting like normal fighting people. Like they’re a hair away from never forgiving each other this time. Only when they mentioned Julian he really let 7 have it. I don’t think it’s a good kind of love if it takes being tortured to figure it out.

I don’t understand how Damar can stand there and be angry about Cardassian casualties but laugh at the loss of a Weyoun clone as if any one of them is less valuable than any other. I think that’s a really interesting contrast within Cardassian structure. Military sacrifice is honorable and noble, but only when it is absolutely necessary. When there isn’t a way to escape. Sacrifice and even murder of any other species, just or unjust, is perfectly fine to him. It’s a deep seeded pride. 

Look at Damar being a good guy! And oh no she actually does love Julian. I thought it was going to be something else and then Worf only heard her shouting out part of the dream. But no they’re actually going this direction. A few seasons ago, I would have been thrilled. But I don’t love the Ezri/Julian pairing. Ezri is a little too mousy, not as intellectual as I would pin for Julian. Julian is arrogant and while I love watching him love and care for anyone, I loved watching him with Serena the most (yes he took advantage of a vulnerable patient and that’s not okay, but it was the right kind of person aside from that. He should be looking for someone with her type of personality). Ezri isn’t going to challenge him enough and he needs that. 

The Changing Face of Evil: Winn disgusts me. It disgusts me that she has so little respect for herself that she’ll defy everything she believes in, first for power and then because she’s in too deep. I’m ambitious guys but I mean holy shit. I am ambitious within the confines of wanting to do the things I do well. I want to be promoted because my work is excellent, performed safely, and performed honestly. I want to honestly improve. I don’t always understand how ambition can corrupt people like this? I guess it’s more unrestrained. But the actress who played her did SUCH A GOOD JOB with the scene where she finds out who Dukat is. That was brilliant. 

Are we gonna build a space moat? Guys I want a space moat. And yes Julian is a child but that’s why we love him. I’m a child on the inside, in case we didn’t establish that a lonnng time ago. 

Whoops there goes the defiant.

Ben was a jerk to Kassidy. This show has a bit of a habit of men mistreating women and the women forgiving them pretty much immediately. I don’t love that. Sisko really had no right to interfere with her work, and she has every right to help fight the war. 

When it Rains: this is my favourite of these episodes so far. Julian and Ezri are hysterically awkward, Kira is so in her element, I love Klingon politics... 

I love that Miles sat there the whole time pretending he could help Julian help Odo. Also, because I’m making no effort at all to avoid spoilers, I knew that Section 31 was involved, and I knew that Star Fleet started the virus, but it still never occurred to me that it was Section 31 that was behind it. I feel a lil dumb to be honest. 

Section 31 is troubling to me. It’s interesting and exciting. But it also feels like a way for the good guys to do bad things while still calling them the good guys and claiming that they adhere to convention Federation morality because they don’t technically condone the bad things. It’s not technically them. But it is them. I think I would have liked it just a bit better if fewer Star Fleet officers were involved in their plans. I liked Sloan’s original explanation, that it was part of the charter and just continued afterwards anyway without any supervision because people forgot about it. But that’s not what it is.

I love Kira in the Star Fleet uniform but I hate the symbolism of it. I like it because she personally joined with the Federation. She agrees with them and is loyal to them. I dislike because it symbolizes a loss of autonomy. Kira wore her Bajoran uniform because she is Bajoran and represents Bajor. Bajor isn’t ready to join the Federation. When you look past Kira, it symbolizes the assimilation of Bajor, rather than a cultural joining. 

I think the Cardassian resistance is interesting. From an evil perspective, I don’t see why the Dominion doesn’t just... squash it. I mean, they infected an entire population forever with a disease for defying them. But they really weren’t that kind to the Cardassians, were they? I thought they were going to be and then they were not. The Dominion soldiers are bred and treated like expendable objects, but for Cardassia, the casualties have families and lives that they won’t get to live. I wish they would make this statement stronger in the show. Nothing is worth this loss of life. But I love that they got there.

2,"What is the In-Universe ""Point"" to Far Beyond The Stars",1594491003,"This may sound weird, but I recently re-watched that episode and I feel like I'm missing something. I fully understand the significance of the bits in the 50's, especially at the time it aired. But I realized the plot of the episode is as follows:

1) Sisko learns another friend died in the war, and is considering leaving Starfleet

2) The Prophets send him the Benny vision, presumably because they need him to stay in Starfleet and captain DS9

3) After his vision, Sisko decides to stay in Starfleet after all (in what is perhaps the most shocking twist in all of Trek)

But I was thinking, is I were Sisko, I would probably have interpreted it as a sign to leave Starfleet. Think about it, Benny is a man who is beaten down by society to the point of insanity (if continuity is a thing across ""fictional"" orb experiences) because of racism. He loses friends, his career, his ability to walk unassisted, and basically everything because he is black. Sisko on the other hand is losing his friends, could easily end a cripple or dead, and is considering ""losing"" his career by resigning. Now the reasons are VERY different (racism vs war), but Sisko should be able to see parallels between the two lives (that, and both people look the same).

Furthermore, Benny didn't actually do anything in terms of the civil rights movement. We're left with no impression he will at the end of the episode, and again the next time we see him he's in an insane asylum. But we do know that, from Sisko's perspective, racism ended centuries ago. Probably after first contact like most negative things in our society.

So from the perspective of captain Sisko, isn't the Benny vision saying ""things will work out without you, if you stay on this path your life will fall apart?"" OTHER people ended racism. OTHER people can end the Dominion War. Benny did nothing. The 50's bits, in isolation, have such a clear and powerful message that I feel like there's something Sisko is taking away from the experience that I am missing which would make the episode that much more impactful then it already is. After all they didn't have to have the bit about potentially resigning, yet they chose to add it in.

(Also I am aware DS9 was supposed to end with the reveal that the entire series was in Benny's head, but it didn't because the studio didn't want to make every single Trek in Benny's head either. At this point even all future series would be in Benny's head if that had happened because you can tie them all back to a character that appeared in DS9 somehow. But even if you believe that, it doesn't answer the question as that just makes Benny a ""bad writer"" rather then the actual writers)",startrek,Official_N_Squared,False,/r/startrek/comments/hpeolh/what_is_the_inuniverse_point_to_far_beyond_the/

Comes to mind the episode where 2 ppl fight a war and the casualties are virtual and ppl kill themselves. It’s mind blowing. Kahn was also awesome.

First time watching Star Trek, and I've had The Next Generation on in the background up to S2: E11, and then something about ""The Royale"" made me stop reading novels and focus and watch it from start to finish. It was so cheesy. It was so camp. It was so brilliant.  

Riker, Data and Worf are all trapped in a hotel casino filled with cheesy cliche characters whilst a romance feud plays out between Mickey D and the Bell Boy, classic, this turns out to be the plot of a corny novel that Picard is able to read on The Enterprise and offers exasperated reactions to. To escape they take on the role of characters in the book and gamble their way to victory in order to buy out the casino.

It was very funny, at least to me. And I think it's partly because I love and enjoy the source material they were making fun of and taking inspiration from, if they ever wrote a novel called ""Star Trek: Hotel Royale"" I'd be the first in line.

First, let me go over the positives. Despite being off the air for over 25 years, many of the ideas and themes are still relevant today. I’ve been pleasantly surprised at how well it holds up.

I feel a lot of current science fiction could learn from the ideas of Star Trek. Taking an action show, adding some futuristic jargon and making the guns “lasers” is hardly compelling SciFi. I wish more shows relied on problem solving and negotiation to solve problems rather than action and violence. How much more compelling would Altered Carbon be if it focused on its compelling universe and the moral complexities of the elite class being more or less immortal, rather than Kovacs killing everyone? 

Though, it needs to be pointed out that TNG has some pretty dated ideas as well. Apparently, man has not evolved past trying to procreate with any willing party. At least the willing part is progress. Star Fleet is still dominated by white, straight, cis males. Basically, one has to assume that the US won world war 3 and the population of humans are predominantly of European descent, or that Star Fleet has many of the same problems we have today in that minorities are vastly underrepresented in positions of power. Otherwise, most of the crew should be Asian (mainly Chinese and Indian) 

It’s also pretty jarring to see some of the stereotypes in the show. For example, the episode I’m currently on has a race of people with an Irish accent that seem to really enjoy alcoholic beverages. If the character’s wife shows up with a black eye, I wouldn’t be completely surprised. It seems like anytime there is a woman in charge, they are usually domineering with their species males being docile and servants. It’s pretty rare to see equality among the sexes.

I’m enjoying my rewatch immensely and am looking forward to seeing if “Best of Both Worlds” holds up to my memory as the best two part episode (if not episode, period) in television history. I’m curious whether anyone can think of better two part episodes.

I think what they should have done is sent every ship they had to hold deep space nine.  Then once they had driven the dominion back into cardassian space they could launch a series of cloaked drones and missles into their territory (think dreadnought from voyager).  Kind of like the maquis said they would do.  Have them destroy shipyards and dominion bases.  And dominion headquarters on cardassia prime.  Hopefully that would get rid of the founder and the vorta.  I know cloaking doesn't always work against the dominion but I think cloaked missiles and drones would easily get by them.  

They could get the cloaking devices from the klingons or the romulans.  As long as they don't put them on their ships it's not a treaty violation.  The best thing would be a simultaneous strike agaisnt as many domion installations as possible.  That way they cripple the dominion's ability to build new ships and repair the ones they have.  Then all they have to do is fight the remaining dominion and cardassian ships.  Using deep space nine as a staging area.  Cloaked missiles and drones could help with that too but you would need a lot of them.

I've been generously added to OpenAI's beta, and instead of practical research, I've been using it to generate new Star Trek episodes.  All I did was supply three episode summaries as an example, and it generates new episodes - based on existing titles - which it then creates a summary of.  The fun (and cool) part of it is the summaries usually connect to the episode title, so they're like alternate universe episodes with different premises from the same title.

For example:
&gt;Season 2, Episode 15: Elementary, Dear Data: When the Enterprise encounters a ship that appears to be under the control of Data, Picard and crew are surprised. Data, however, is not surprised in the least.

&gt;Season 6, Episode 16: The Quality of Life: A new robotic, autonomous lifeform forms on the Enterprise, and everyone is grossed out by how much it looks like a severed arm.  It really looks like a severed arm.

&gt;Season 1, Episode 16: Datalore: Data is damaged and his memories are restored, giving Picard and co. a glimpse into his life before the Enterprise.  It turns out, Data was a naughty boy.

And perhaps MOST controversially for this sub, it generated:

&gt;Season 1, Episode 15: Tuvix: Neelix and Tuvok become trapped in a transporter and are fused into one person. Captain Janeway decides not to kill them, and lets Tuvix live.

Anyway, you can see them here!

74,In-universe designations for eras,1594392408,"  

Inspired by the work of Tim Palgut from Cydonia6 [http://www.cydonia6.com/](http://www.cydonia6.com/) (who created the in-universe TOS and TMP designations). I went through and made some in-universe designations for my own enjoyment and thought I would share. I used STD for DIS because I wanted to keep ‘T” as an acronym (and because I couldn’t find an acronym for DIS that I liked) I also tried to think of an appropriate acronym for the Next Gen movies and went with FIN for First contact, Insurrection and Nemesis. I didn’t go with DS9 or VOY because I didn’t think they really represented the designs. DS9 is already an in-universe designation and VOY didn’t really represent the entire look of star trek IMO.

I included STO because I love STO :D

ENT – Earth Native Technology (2150-2230)

STD – Surplus Technology Derivative (2230-2255)

TOS – Technology: Original Standard (2255-2270

TMP – Technology Modified Program (2270-2330)

TNG – Technology: Network Generalized (2320-2370)

FIN – Forward Interception Nominal  (2370-2400)

STO – Specialized Technology Orientation (2400-)

ENT is early Starfleet ships based solely on Earth designs with only very limited influence from other galactic powers)

STD is notable for large and study ships which experimented with vastly experimental computer systems and technologies used within less sophisticated spaceframes. 

TOS is distinctive as the first cohesive and uniformed Starfleet design method which included more mechanical interiors and streamlined appearance of all designs in this period.

TMP was the natural progression into a more complex design philosophy following TOS

TNG is notable for the desire to create large expansive ships designed for comfort and family use. 

FIN was a direct result of the Borg threat and Dominion war. Ships of this area and more combat ready and notable with the more angular designs.

STO is a furtherance of the FIN standard but this more emphasis on customization and adaptability of older spaceframes with newer technology.",startrek,jmaugrim,False,/r/startrek/comments/hoq7dh/inuniverse_designations_for_eras/

It seems like every time a ship is rocked by weapons fire or some other significant shock, consoles will start violently exploding and sending loads of shrapnel like a claymore mine into the face of whatever poor sucker is operating that console.

This can’t seem like a wise strategy. Most contemporary navies generally go to great lengths to try and protect their crew.

At the very least, they have surge protectors. And if that isn’t enough, if there is a massive surge, the electronics in any given component will just fry, and maybe a capacitor might pop off, but consoles on the bridges of contemporary naval ships don’t explode when the ship is rocked.

80,I've created an Infinite Star Trek Adventure in AI Dungeon,1594376847,"[Here is the link (you may have to click it twice)](https://play.aidungeon.io/scenario/a4325610-c23c-11ea-aa00-fb5dad1e683f?fbclid=IwAR2iNXvIFi8T3-lkLc0qMY0s_BL9u4F5cBGUorZOhHBAZpOBChkuiFuykQU) 

AI Dungeon is an astonishingly capable story teller. It's like a text adventure except it pulls from an enormous amount of data about how language works and fictional worlds to never be stumped. You can type literally anything, and do literally anything.

I'm posting this now because the AI has been updated to be more robust, and now even has MULTIPLAYER if you want to explore the galaxy with a group of friends!

(The AI can be taught very granular details about everything in a world and the characters in it, but I have yet to fill it with the entirety of Memory Alpha so things *will* go crazy from time to time. For me Troi had become head of security, and spoke with a thick Irish brogue. For others Doctor Crusher married O'Brien after Keiko's death... In the event the world goes doolally, just hit the 'retry' button and the AI will try again (especially useful if characters get weird or forget where they are).

 The more you give, the more you get. If you use the Say and Do commands separately and write full sentences then so will the AI. So instead of

    Do: Tell Q to give me pony

try

    Say: Q, darling, you know I'd do anything for you! So, could you do one tiny thing for me? And could that thing be a big white pony named Sir Puffle?""

This applies to actions too. Instead of

    Do: open bag

Try

    Do: unzip the bag, grab it and spin like a whirling dervish, scattering the items inside with the power of centrifugal force.

 Or

    Do: Replicate a phaser and set it to tight beam mode, and fire it at my bag, severing the top.

You can also use the edit and undo commands to change what the AI outputs, and it will treat it as though it really happened. This is not cheating: You're teaching it how you want the world to act. Little changes like switching 'gold' for 'gold pressed latinum' and 'elevator' for 'turbolift' will make the AI catch on.

The AI will begin to reflect your own writing style. The game has objectives but sometimes the AI can't parse that you've achieved them: if you successfully do the current objective (like Meet Picard after unpacking) you can click the satchel icon to show the objectives, and manually tick it. There are only a few objectives right now, but I'll be fleshing them out as soon as I've got the characters completely sane.

&amp;#x200B;

Enjoy!

Excerpt from a test player, who kept being harried by a guy named Hans all over the ship:

    &gt; You take your bag and unpack it.
    You take out some clothes, a picture from home, a medipack, and so on. You unpack your bag, dump the contents out, then start putting things away. Finally finished, you collapse into bed. You fling yourself against the pillow, sighing in relief.
    The door clicks.
    You sit bolt upright in bed, emitting a loud shriek of terror. You've become very good at hearing the sounds of approaching danger.
    
    &gt; You say ""Who is it?""
    ""It's me,"" a familiar voice replies.
    Hans enters, holding a tray. On the tray is a glass of wine and some fresh fruit. He places it on the floor, then looks at you with a smile.
    ""Having second thoughts?"" he asks. ""Here, have a drink.""
    
    &gt; You say ""Hans, you are the single creepiest man I've ever met. Get out of my quarters or I'll put in a complaint!""
    ""You must be mistaken,"" he says. ""I'm sure Jean-Luc would never listen to such a thing.""
    ""I'm serious,"" you say.
    ""I know you are,"" he says, putting his hand to his chest. ""But that doesn't mean I won't sit here and amuse you.""
    He sits down on the floor, leans back against the wall, and puts his feet up on the bed.
    ""Tell me about when you were little,"" he requests.
    
    &gt; You say ""Jesus Christ, what's wrong with you?""
    ""Tell me about when you were little.""
    
    &gt; You call security and tell them Hans is being inappropriate, uninvited, in your room.
    You spend the next few minutes trying to convince Hans to leave, while he laughs and asks questions. You give up, call security, and wait. Finally, after what seems an eternity, two men arrive. One is human, one is a robotic dog.

    &gt; You say "" Are you telling me Hans really is ship security? He's violently insane!""
    ""Oh dear,"" the man says. ""If that's true, then he's really not security at all. He's a threat to the safety of the ship.""
    ""Sarge!"" Hans says. ""Don't you have a bone to pick with this man?""

    ""At least not on my bed,"" you say.

    Riker nods. ""Of course. I'll have him taken care of.""
    ""Thank you,"" you say.
    ""You're welcome,"" Riker says, flashing a smile.
    You watch as he turns and walks away.
    ""Now,"" he says. ""I'll have to get the paperwork started. What did you need?""
    
    &gt; You say ""For a start, can someone please REMOVE HANS FROM MY ROOM!""
    ""Sir,"" Sarge says, ""the man is an invited guest. He has the right to stay.""
    ""What? No he doesn't!"" you say. ""He's a threat to the safety of this ship!""
    ""The only person who thinks that,"" Sarge says, ""is you.""
    ""Are you kidding me?"" you say. ""He's sitting on my bed! He barges in uninvited! How is that not a threat to the safety of this ship?""
    ""Well, sir,"" Sarge says, ""as I said, he's an invited guest.""
    ""What's that?"" Hans asks. ""Am I allowed to stay or not?""
    ""You're welcome to stay, sir,"" Sarge says.
    ""I'm not sure if I wish to do so,"" Hans says.
    ""Oh come on!"" you say. ""You need to leave!""
    ""Why? So I can sit on another person's bed without asking first?""
    ""No!""

82,Jem Hadar troops vs Borg Drones onboard a cube?,1594364158,"So let’s say there were a few Borg vs Dominion skirmishes along the Gamma/Delta Border, and a few platoons of Jem Hadar soldiers beam aboard a Borg Cube. Eventually they’d be destroyed, but how much damage could they do in the meantime?

From what I know about both sides, the Jem Hadar would likely tear the Cube to shreds from the inside and likely leave a big pile of dead drones. Here’s why,

1. Jem Hadar move far quicker than drones and are far stronger. To take one Jem Hadar down, several drones would have to dog-pile it.

2. Drones are weak against melee weapons and hand to hand combat, which is what the Jem Hadar specialize in. Jem Hadar can easily give Klingons a beating, Drones would be fish in a barrel for them.

3. Assimilating the Jem Hadar is definitely possible, but very difficult and likely not even worth it. The Ketracel White dependency could be dealt with, in the same way assimilated humans don’t need food or water, but that’s assuming the Jem Hadar even get assimilated. For starters, like I said before, it would take about 10 drones to defeat one Jem Hadar, let alone get it in a position to inject it with nano-probes. Second off, the Vorta and/or Founders can terminate Jem Hadar remotely, and that’s assuming they don’t kill themselves out of loyalty. 

4. The Jem Hadar are basically chaos incarnate, they’d destroy everything onboard that cube like a bull in a China shop.

90,Can we all appreciate that DSC and PIC isn't like the Abramsverse?,1594356543,"Hi, I'm a longtime fan of Star Trek, been watching it since I was young, during the 90s, my brother introduced me to TOS, couldn't get into it though because 60s, then he introduced me to TNG, which I loved, then I watched DS9 and VOY, but I couldn't get into ENT, then during the 2000s, I watched the TOS movies, and I fell in love with Kirk and his crew.

I absolutely hated the Abramsverse movies, I had to stomach my way through watching the 2009 and the Into Darkness movies, the only movie that I really liked was the Beyond movie, but still, the Abramsverse was an insult to me, it wasn't Star Trek.

But when Discovery was announced, I was miffed that it was another prequel like ENT, but was pleasantly surprised by it, I love the story being presented in the show, I like the characters as well, I love that the Captain isn't the hero of the story like in previous Treks.

Then Picard came along and I'm absolutely loving it, that finally, we got a show that shows the future after VOY, and we got a great story and great characters.

Obviously, we aren't getting the Trek of old from the 90s that I enjoyed, and that's fine, change is okay as long as the source material is respected and I find that DSC and PIC have respected the source material more than JJ Abrams ever did, and sure, some liberties were took with the source material, but still, DSC and PIC is so much better than the Abramsverse, so for me, I appreciate it, and so does Patrick Stewart I believe, since I heard that he agreed to get on board Picard with the condition that the show isn't a reboot of TNG, and I agree with him, we don't need a reboot of Trek, we need a new and respectful Trek and not that Abramsverse crap that we got.",startrek,ardouronerous,False,/r/startrek/comments/hoiqna/can_we_all_appreciate_that_dsc_and_pic_isnt_like/

97,Thoughts after Discovery Re-Watch; an Ex-hater's perspective,1594350123,"So thanks to the massive amount of downtime we've been having due to various crises, I started catching up on my backlog.  My roommate wanted to watch Discovery Season 2.  Given that I'd only seen Discovery Season 1 once, and ... well, hate it is a bit strong, but I was not a fan, so I decided I should sit down and give the first season a 2nd chance before we got around to S2.

**Season One Second Thoughts**

I think the thing that made the biggest difference was, I knew what to expect from the two-part premiere going in.  Instead of being slapped in the face with the Klingon re-design from out of nowhere, the massive lore inconsistencies, and the fact that the two hour premiere was *not* about the eponymous ship or its crew, I rolled in already aware of what to expect.  

So rather than spending my viewing time getting more and more annoyed at everything I disliked, I sat back and just enjoyed it.  And it went a lot better than I remembered.  Which put me on a much better footing with Burnham, because due to the way the series is designed, one's ability to enjoy the series is directly related to how much one likes her character.  

The first time around, I either had one of two reactions to her:  annoyance or indifference.  This time, it was a mix of intrigue and occasional annoyance.  Even Tyler, who I had dubbed ""Lt. Cardboard"" on my first viewing, was more interesting this go-around, and as such, his relationship with Burnham didn't become a source of boredom and irritation.  Amazing what a difference a first impression makes.

I think the most significant change was how much I enjoyed her relationship with Sarek.  I just wish they'd found a way to do it without the ""long lost sister"" retcon (such as making her a student or protege, allowing her to grow up with Spock without yet another Surprise Sibling Reveal).  

What didn't change was my enjoyment of Saru, Stamets, Tilly, Lorca, and Culber.  Even when DISC annoyed me, I loved the supporting cast.  I personally enjoyed the Mirror Universe arc, if for no other reason than because it provided a more interesting look at their society, and didn't just portray them all as Stupid Evil, like on TOS or ENT (the DS9 mirror episodes were of a different era (literally)).  And of course, it gave us Mirror-Georgiou, who remains my favorite recurring character, and only highlights my wish that Discovery had been about her original self and not Burnham.  

What I find weird, on a second viewing, is how the Klingon War plot is treated, Voq in particular.  They spend a third of the season building him up to be super-important.  Then he vanishes.  Then the ""twist"" in beginning of the last third reveals where he went.  And shortly thereafter, Voq dies on an operating table having accomplished exactly nothing.  I honestly wonder if he wasn't a holdover from the Bryan Fuller days that they didn't know what to do with, so they just got rid of him as quickly as possible.  

And then there's the fact that KW seems to happen almost entirely off-screen.  Sure, Discovery pops in and out of various battles.  But ultimately, the crew pop off to the M-U, and come back to find it mostly over, and have to pull off a Deus Ex Machina to pull a UFP victory out of their asses at the proverbial last minute.  Also, I find the resolution to be complete BS, and could rant about that for a page or two, but let's stay focused.  

Ultimately, Season One was a lot better for me on a second go-around.  I think it would have been better if they'd taken the two part premiere, chopped it up into flashbacks spread throughout the season, and let the focus be on the crew of Discovery as a whole with Burnham as the main character without letting dominate the show.  But in the end, it was an enjoyable ride, and I went into Season 2 cautiously optimistic.

**Season Two First Viewing**

Okay, it's really weird.  There's so much of this season that seems to address a lot of fan complaints I remembered reading about back in the day.  The show is more idealistic.  The bridge crew get personalities, backstories, and allowed to actually deliver more than just basic responses to orders.  Some of the rougher lore spots get a smoothing out.  Hell, with the reveal that Burnham was saved as a child by a time traveler, I've pretty much moved this show into its own continuity, which fixes 90% of my Lore Nerd issues all by itself.

But... they also went and doubled-down on the show's biggest flaw:  Burnham being the absolute central character, and her bad-fan-fiction-y long-lost sibling backstory.  It's like back on Smallville, when the producers realized the fan base was growing sick of Lana Lang, so rather than dial it back or address issues with the character, they shoved her down the audience's throats even harder, with other characters now shilling how amazing she was?  Yeah, it was pretty much like that.  

If I'd gone into S2 without a S1 re-watch, I probably would have quit by episode 5 or 6.  But since I went in with a mild fondness for Burnham, it was only eye-rolling rather than anger-inducing.  It also helped that she has such good chemistry with all three of her foster family, that when it was actively on-screen, and not just being talked about, I kind of enjoyed it.  It's like they say:  there are no bad ideas, just badly executed ones.  I still wish they'd not done the long lost sister bit, but I'll give them points for being to pull it off better than they had any right to.  

Also, I just have to add Sonequa Martin-Green's performance is amazing.  There are several scenes that could have come off as schmaltzy or anvil-dropping or just narm-y, but she sells her character so well, that for the most part, something that might have irritated me in the hands of a lesser actor, she made work.  Everything that is, except... for the internal monologues.  Now this I put all on the writers.  But Burnham's frequent internal monologues were neither as deep nor as profound as the writer clearly thought they were.  And several times, they crossed over into eye-rolling or groan-inducing, even despite the actor's delivery.  

Pike was an addition I'd been dreading, but instead found myself enjoying greatly.  He didn't take over the show, and he gelled well with the previous interpretations of the character both in TOS and the Kelvin-verse.  Ansom Mount did a great job, and I'd been really leery of his casting after his ""block of wood' performance in the short-lived ""Marvel's Inhumans"" series.  I do have one minor complaint, in that his command style changed radically depending on the writer.   One episode, he'd be a firm ""hand on the rudder"" who still listened to all his officers and took their advice, but ultimately made the final calls.  And in the next, he'd be this laid-back ""let you guys do this your own way"" hands-off type.  Still not as bi-polar as Janeway, but it was odd.  

Spock was capably done, imo.  I know that' a divisive point for some, but I honestly liked the new guy (sorry, blanking on his name, atm).  Though, strangely, I liked his Spock better with the beard.  

The other character who really came into his own this season was Saru.  While I have my issues with how the Prime Directive was tossed out the airlock with barely a word of lip service, in a situation where it clearly should have been a major discussion point, overall it was a great character arc.  I hope he winds up being the Discovery's new captain.  But given how he begged off the title in the finale, and the producers' all-consuming love of Burnham, I expect she'll have the center seat next season.  

The Red Angel plotline was certainly interesting.  Though admittedly, when Airiam announced ""it's all about you"" to Burnham, I couldn't help but snark ""when isn't it""?""  That aside, it was enjoyable. I'm a slut for time travel stories, so I'm biased there.  Having said that, I do think the writers keep trying to hard to have ""big super-heavy crises.""  Last season it was ""save the multiverse from fungal pollution.""  This season it was ""save all sapient life from the Evil AI"" (and the fact that this plotline was basically re-run in Picard didn't do that series any favors, but that's another thread for another day).  

Speaking of ruining tension, who thought it was a smart idea for Spock to join the ""we'll go with Michael"" team?  Since we know he can't go, it undercuts any and all tension as the audience knows he's not going to go, so the plan is either not going to work (which it has to because its the Last Resort), or he's not going.  

Last nitpick (i swear), the whole ""we can jump!"" / ""it won't matter, Control will just follow us"" excuse falls really flat if you know anything about travel times in Star Trek (and seeing how they based an entire 7-year series on it, it's hard not to).  Yeah, it'll follow.  Jump to the far side of the Gamma Quadrant and by yourself plenty of time to come up with a plan.  There's no need for a ticking clock here.  

That said, great final battle.  I loved it.  I've not seen a battle that awesome in Star Trek since the last season of DS9.  

Overall, I enjoyed this season.  I think season 2 is overall weaker than Season 1, but it ultimately seemed to be a bridge season for getting us from the S1 version of the show to this entirely different S3 version.  And in trilogies, the 2nd act is usually the weakest (not saying the show is a trilogy, but you get my point).  I think the main area where its strongest is that S2 felt closer to the kind of Star Trek I expected, being told in the modern style, where the first season took a while to get there (though, that was apparently the point if you take the S1 finale as meta-commentary).  

In the final analysis, Discovery has been a fun Star Trek series.  It's not my favorite series, but it's far from the worst.  I'll not trigger a flame war by actually ranking said series. I simply wanted to post my thoughts and see what discussion crops up.  For the people who don't like the series, I can certainly understand why, as I've felt many of the same things.  But I do think that, if some want to re-examine the series at a later date, as I did, they might find them warming up to it just a little.  But that's something they have to want for themselves.

98,"Long Time Star Trek Fan Finally Watches DS9: Season 7, Episodes 14-18",1594349176,"Chimera: this feels like a misguided attempt to discuss race. It feels misguided because Loz straight up murdered someone. He was in complete control of that situation. If it was truly a defense reflex, he wouldn’t have said “Mine’s bigger” when he pulled his own knife. He internally dodged the knife, and then stabbed him in a way that was fatal when he very well could have disarmed him. When Odo says that it’s going to get straightened out in trial... straightened out to him means getting away with murder. 

I also disagree with Loz’s points about Odo’s imitation of humanoids. Odo has the capacity to make choices. When he was human, briefly, Julian turned him into a Klingon, and then suggested that he could give Odo any facial features he wanted. Odo chose to have his face imperfectly sculpted because it does represent who he is. 

I kind of hate that Kira’s making Odo’s internal struggle about her. “But if that’s not who you are, do you really love me?” That’s not an exact quote but that’s the gist of it. What I did get out of this is that she really does love him. But still. 

Badda Bing Badda Bang: I absolutely loved this. I love that Vic has become something to ralley behind. The entire episode is enchanting. The senior staff is holding a casino heist. This show (with the exception of the Ezri episode where she investigates the serial killer) is fantastic at modernizing and spinning old tropes into scifi. I also love that lots of the plan went wrong and they were able to adjust and correct on the fly. It demonstrates fantastic teamwork. And you all know that I love to watch them cooperate. They’re a good enough team that they can each figure out a way to troubleshoot, buy more time. Everyone’s a winner!

And then Sisko sings at the end after talking about how silly the whole thing was. I feel obligated to comment on Sisko’s perspective on this type of program, which honors a time period he believes should not be honored or respected. It raises the question about whether or not we should discount the cultural contributions of the time because they were racist and exclusionary. Just because Vic the program isn’t racist doesn’t mean that the culture from which he was created wasn’t. It was. We know that. If there were a real Vic Fontane that he was based off of, there is a significant likelihood that he would not have accepted Kassidy or Sisko. So his argument makes sense. On the other hand, hologram Vic Fontane is a beautiful, uniting thing. He doesn’t discriminate, human or not, different races, anything. And I don’t feel great about Sisko dismissing those benefits because of the historical context it was drawn from.

I’d love to hear y’all’s thoughts on this but I also have a feeling most of you are more interested in talking about the next episode. I let it start playing while I was writing up the Vic episode and holy crap I’m going to have to stay up and watch this, aren’t I?

Inter Arma Enim Silent Leges: here we go! Somebody has explained the title to me already in a previous post (I saw Enim, thought Elim and though it had to do with Garak which is does not) but I can’t find it so can you please explain it again? Ah, just kidding. In time of war the law falls silent. Unfortunately for our dear admiral, it wasn’t just the law that he abandoned in this episode. 

I loved this episode, because the characters were incredibly well done. Julian’s sense of trust then betrayal while still maintaining a sense of moral obligation is pretty intense. That said, uh... guys? I’m not entirely sure what this whole intelligence mission accomplished. If anything the two governments trust each other less which doesn’t help the war effort. I vaguely get that we are trying to solidify the Romulan involvement in the war so I’ll comment on that- THE FEDERATION HAS NO RIGHT TO DO THAT!! I think Julian pointed out that meddling in the Romulan Senate is directly against the Star Fleet charter Sloan claimed to be part of (although they sort of retconned that a bit and it doesn’t make a lot of sense).

On the last Section 31 episode, somebody pointed out that Sloan is like Sisko except we don’t understand his motivations. Sisko makes just as unethical choices and gets away with it. Whoever left that comment, you are so, so right. I can’t unsee it now. Sisko did pretty much exactly this for exactly the same reason (assuming I understand what happened correctly). Even if you believe his cover story, that he was seeking revenge for the suspected murder of his mentor, Sisko did that, too. He essentially went on a rampage trying to kill Maquis dude. He used biogenic weapons. We just see the whole story, whereas Sloan just acts and we assume the motivation is to protect Federation values. 

Penumbra: I love Ezri and Worf together. 

Also, it’s alright Wormhole aliens, I never liked Kassidy either. But I was kind of excited for a wedding. And I loved Sisko’s wedding ring from the little house he wanted to build in the mountain. 

I’m starting to see why you guys like Damar so much. He’s pretty funny. 

I don’t have much else to say about this. It felt a little out of character for Ezri to run off. Th writers haven’t done a great job balancing out Ezri’s mousiness with the strength of the Dax symbiont. At times, she’s too much like new Jadzia and not enough like herself, and at other times it’s like the symbiont isn’t even there.

Til Death Do Us Part: I loved every second of this. I think they could have done more with Winn leading up to this point but she’s good in this. 

I love the scenes with Worf and Ezri both struggling with nightmares/memories. It was very intense and quite beautiful, in a way. Very vulnerable. And certainly revealing about their characters.

Why did they want this admiral to do the ceremony? He’s not a good person. I don’t know if Sisko realizes what he did to Kassidy when he called off the wedding and then back on. That must have been brutal but we sort of just moved right along. 

Is this the beginning of the end? I think this is the beginning of the end. 

OH shoot was it the wraiths that told Sisko not to marry Kassidy (not the wormhole aliens)? Because Kassidy is actually going to help defeat the wraiths? Why am I suddenly so invested in defeating the wraiths? Because I know we’re going to in some big dramatic battle? It still feels a little silly, guys.

99,What are essential Star Trek: The Next Generation episodes?,1594349018,"Hello everyone! For some background information about it, I have watched all of Star Trek: The Next Generation, Deep Space 9, Voyager, and the first two seasons of Enterprise. I haven't seen any of the movies yet because they aren't available on Netflix or Hulu, so I was going to watch them all in a big burst when I eventually get around to finishing Enterprise.

My girlfriend has been dismissive about getting into Star Trek with me for a while now, but I was watching The Orville and she overheard some stuff and got interested. She really enjoys it and is ready to give Star Trek a go. Based on the parts she enjoyed most about The Orville, I think she will enjoy Deep Space 9, but I wat to give her a crash course of TNG before we start Deep Space 9. Maybe a dozen or so episodes that kind of give her any essential information she may need as a primer plus just generally some 'best-of' content before we start DS9.

I would also appreciate it if you could give you the reasoning behind each episode, but it is not required. Thank you for anything you can send my way!

11,Having watched Picard before Nemesis,1594334345,"Ive only recently picked up this franchise last year starting with TNG. After watching DS9, VOY, TOS, ENT, and most of DIS Picard was released and I was blown away to say the very least. Something that didn’t quite click in my understanding of the story was Data’s death. How? Why? Who would harm such a beautiful soul? After the miniseries ended the song “Blue Skies” of all things plays. Again, what the hell?

There were some obvious gaps in my knowledge so I kept watching starting with the movies (not the big budget Hollywood reboots either). Now I don’t know how it was having seen the whole series (movies included) before watching Picard, but having watched Picard first, then Nemesis was *super* impactful. The first time Data sings Blue Skies at the wedding my first impression was “oh that’s a nice call back”. The plot ensues (which is good, but kind of forgettable imo), and then it happens. Data’s big sacrifice. The worst and best part of the franchise (worst because Data is my absolute favorite, best because it’s just so Data, and the acting is remarkable, and the callbacks from Picard immeasurably amplifies the event). 

Then it clicked. Data is a musician, and the last thing he ever performed was Blue Skies. Picard is all about honoring the spirit of Data, not only through the act of aiding his progeny, but with Jean-Luc finally coming to terms with the loss of one of his dearest friends. The final copy of Data’s consciousness is deleted and he is finally put to rest. Blue Skies playing at the end is not only emotionally provoking, but it’s damn good scoring.

I remember that one of my biggest problems with season 1, was that the Klingons, between how they themselves were portrayed, and the aesthetic of their ships, both interior and exterior, they seemed more like space orcs, rather than Klingons.

So thus, in season 2, they gave them hair again, and introduced the D-7, so that we would have a ship that actually resembles a Klingon ship we as viewers are used to, and not something that looks like it flew out of Mordor, like the Klingon ships in season 1 did.

My theory is that after season 1, the studio got feedback that they needed to make the Klingons appear closer to how they had been portrayed in  previous media.

I thought earlier in the series that maybe they were phasing the TNG uniforms out, but that doesn't seem to be the case as far as I can tell. A lot of the non-DS9 Starfleet officers we see still wear the TNG-style. I just watched the episode ""Homefront,"" and when Sisko takes a temporary post on Earth, he changes from the DS9 uniform to the TNG style. Everyone else on Earth also seems to be wearing the old style uniform.

One guess I had was that a space station crew might wear a different style uniform than a starship crew-- Worf changes from his TNG-style uniform to a DS9 style when he joins the crew on the station--but we see crew on the Enterprise wear the DS9 uniforms in *Generations*, so that's not it either. And it's not like the DS9 crew changes uniforms whenever they take the Defiant through the wormhole.

I can't figure out if there's a pattern. It somehow feels both haphazard *and* deliberate. Like, if the uniform change didn't mean something, I don't think there would have been such a dramatic reveal of Worf in the DS9 uniform, or that Sisko would have changed styles in ""Homefront.""

49,In a light defense of Star Trek Discovery,1594276520,"It has been a while since I have invested interest in Star Trek Discovery so some facts and opinions may not be known to me.

But personally, I think Star Trek Discovery should not be given the negative reputation that is receives from old Star Trek fans. If I recall, this was the attitude that many Original Series fans held against Next Generation fans in that it wasn't the same show as Roddenberry envisioned it.

Yes Star Trek Discovery may be different. It's darker nature is heavily influenced from more modern television series like Game of Thrones. The aesthetics can be off-putting at times from the technology presented on the Discovery to the way how the Klingons look. Hell even the main cast can be unlikable at times.

At first, I was against Discovery when I first heard about it and when I read reviews about the first few episodes online. But then I realized after a few years that maybe Discovery is good for those reasons. The fact that is unlike any other Trek that we have seen before. 

Personally, I justify the morally challenged cast because they aren't the Enterprise. The crew of the Discovery is just a slice of the United Federation that we have rarely seen during the time of the Original Series. I also justify the fact that the Klingons looks different because they have looked different before. The Original Series Klingons lacked the notable forehead ridge from the Next Generation Klingons. It isn't hard to believe that the Discovery Klingons are just simply a different variation of Klingons either through genetic mutation or whatnot. Are they the most appealing design? No, not really. But maybe that's the point of having redesigned Klingons. To look less human and more alien.

The Discovery itself was a major point of controversy, having technology that the Enterprise doesn't have. Well maybe the Discovery is an experimental ship and the Federation invested more time and resources in designing the Discovery to be as advanced as possible. Like a black-ops ship that shouldn't be known to the public unlike the NCC-1701 USS Enterprise that many of the audience was used to during the 1960s.

These are just my thoughts. Please correct me if I'm wrong and feel free to add in your views on my post.

56,Anti-intellectualism and antisciene in Star Trek,1594264664,"I was rewatching Deep Space 9 season 3, episodes 11 and 12 titled 'Past Tense' which tackled extreme poverty and homelessness on a massive scale on Earth in 2024, which another Redditor described as prescient to our current situation in some countries.

I have noticed Star Trek being what we would refer to these days as perhaps 'hard sci-fi', in that many advanced scientific concepts and terminology are used in conversation, even though very much of it is made up and complete fiction, but I never really noticed how everyone seems to understand and digest most of what is said when these technical diatribes are laid out by engineers or specialists, and when they don't understand they ask for further explanations or details to be able to understand better.

I suppose it's not surprising, since all fleet officers must undergo training to understand the functions of the ships and technology to some degree.

There's rarely a point at which the technology is questioned, or the the captain or anyone says ""I don't need the mumbo jumbo, just get to the point!"" like in some other tv shows or movies where the detective might admonish the forensic scientist or technician for talking too technical. The Trek writers accept and appreciate the scientific method, and take the time to let the characters investigate, analyse and expound on technical problems or puzzles or obstacles they need to overcome.

It made me think about the contrast of optimistic science fiction such as Star Trek, where knowledge and truth equates to hope and courage, and how so often the challenges they face are ignorance and anti-intellectualism. It certainly draws comparisons to the current state of the USA (using for comparison since most people on Reddit are from USA) and how masks and vaccinations, among many other scientific advices and endeavours, have been heavily politicised.

There's probably no simple way to describe the extremely complex systems in place that have failed and allowed this antisciene and anti-intellectualism to prosper, just as there is no simple way to overcome it. I fear greatly that we as a species are straying further and further from the possibilities that Star Trek offers us.

Are there any other episodes across the broad library of Star Trek that I might watch to see more of this, specifically regarding antisciene or the rejection or politicisation of technology?",startrek,CreativeAnalytics,False,/r/startrek/comments/hnvnp4/antiintellectualism_and_antisciene_in_star_trek/

Here they are on a planet out of the way. Nobody knows they're there. 100,000 friendly humans equipped with alien tech that would likely have some things they don't.

She doesn't propose an alliance? A staging op?!

In her place, I would have brought a proposal to the leadership of the planet: Let us stay a while. We will teach you your history, and allow you access to our knowledge and some of our technology. You are human, you have an advanced culture, and we'll bring you fully up to date as a Federation remote outpost. In return, we would like your help in the construction of a fleet, and we hope that some of your citizens choose to join us when they fly. For us, the journey home continues. For them, their society's first interstellar mission.

They are anticipating a LONG trip. They already know it's dangerous as all hell. They know they have enemies. They know they need allies. I reckon given 5 years, they could construct 4-6 brand new Intrepid class ships with Voyager as the flagship.

A 5 year wait, and then the upshot is that they get to continue the journey as a fleet. In this region of space, 5 ships would be a flipping armada. The Kazon wouldn't stand a hope in hell, basically only the Borg would be an obstacle, and more ships gives more bargaining power at every single turn. It gives flexibility in negotiations, the ability to send ships off on supply runs, etc.

The cast is really well developed and the technology of the show is interesting and it doesn’t work perfect all the time. The NX-01 wasn’t always superior to its enemies. That’s what makes the show great imo, the humans were the underdogs. Exploring space brings unforeseen challenges but in the end it’s about us as humans working together to overcome those obstacles.

When Picard is attempting to explain his risky plan to a group of admirals, namely, to go and offer the Cardassians a replicator in exchange for an end to the war, he explains that the Cardassians believe a federeation starbase was being created close to Cardassian space to prepare for an invasion.  Two of the admirals quickly point out, that this is not possible (for multiple reasons), the most important being, that is not the ""federation way"" of doing things, in short, the federation would never ""invade.""  Interesting, Picard answers back, but it is the Cardassian way, and that they ""project their own motivations upon us.""  

This is called ""unobserved bias,"" it is a type of cognitive error we all do, and in a way, just as the admirals were imposing their motivations upon the Cardassians, Picard was clever enough to recognize that the Cardassians were doing the same, imposing their motivations upon the federation and acting upon this unobserved bias.

82,TNG S2 worst and best episodes:,1594234116,"So I have  finished TNG season 2 for the first time and here are the best and worst episodes in my opinion of the season, let's open a nice discussion below:

_worsts:_

Episodes 1: _the_ _child_ :
An alien raped consular troi, what terrible premise. The child is failing on the story telling with a ridiculous one.

Episode 2: _Where_ _silence_ _has_ _lease_ :
This episode might not be as bad as the other ones, but nothing important as happened and the wesley switch was weird.

Episode 10: _the_ _dauphin_ :
This whole wesley falls in love storyline was bad, and the apotropost was really really annoying.

Episode 18: _Up_ _the_ _long_ _ladder_ :
A sexualist, boring, stupid and horny episode. The story was awful, and everything failed in this one.

Episode 24: _shades_ _of_ _grey_ : I can't stand clip shows, so of course I hated this episode, it was medically illogical, and it was a clip show, terrible way to end this season:

_bests:_

Episode 8: _A_ _matter_ _of_ _honor_ :
A great episode with a great execution of a story, Riker was great, and it was a really cool episode.

Episode 9: _The_ _measure_ _of_ _a_ _man_ :
A philosophical episode that went really well with it's premiere, the court was interesting and this episode was successful.

Episode 16: _Q_ _who?_  :
My favourite episode so far of the show  Q who presents the terrifying Borgs and makes the federation understand and they aren't ready for anything, I can't wait  to see more Borgs.

Episode 20: _The_ _emissary_ :
Worf only got around 3 main episodes so far, but when he get one it is probably great. This one is no exception, the episode is  good and it was nice to learn more about the klingons traditions.

Episode 21:  _Peak_ _performance_ :
A battle game can always lead to a good place and it happened in this episode. The last 13 minutes makes this episode and it is a lot of fun. Usually only one storyline is good in each episodes  but the end of data's storyline here was good.

84,I'm now a Trekkie.,1594233096,"Growing up, my dad watched Star Trek, and I vaguely remember seeing some episodes from time to time. Once I got into my thirties, I developed a real interest in science fiction, and started wading through all the classic books, television shows and movies. For one reason or another, Star Trek was never one of them. I also made the mistake of watching some of the newer movies before the show, which gave me the impression that they were just kind of pop action films set in space.

Once this pandemic hit and my work slowed down, I had more time, and I started watching the television shows in chronological order (chronological meaning by release date, not in-universe). The original series is old, and while I got through it and did enjoy some of it, I just couldn't disregard how, well, cheesy it was. This doesn't take away from how new and revolutionary it was at the time, I just have trouble enjoying visual media from back in the day. 

(As an aside, I now have these problems when watching old James Bond, which was my all-time favourite character growing up).

Once I got into Next Generation, though, I really couldn't believe I hadn't yet watched that series. Picard and Data and Worf - and many others - were such well-developed characters.

Then I got into Voyager and Deep Space Nine, and I have been kicking myself ever since for not seeing this stuff earlier. The philosophical themes, the willingness to explore complex plots without beating the audience over the head with things, the growth of the characters - it is truly incredible how much I'm enjoying it. Voyager took awhile for me to get into because I had grown so attached to NG characters, but once I finished the episode where Tuvok went behind Janeway's back in an attempt to free her of making an unprincipled choice, I was fully in.

Anyways, I'm not an expert. I don't know much about the lore, since this is my first time viewing the series. I haven't read any of the books.

5,Long Time Star Trek Fan Finally Watches DS9: season 7 episodes 11-13,1594212778,"Guys! Guess who got to watch Star Trek this morning! 

Prodigal Daughter: I absolutely loved this episode. I wonder if I would have liked the other Miles/Orion Syndicate episode if I could see it (couldn’t watch the screen- flashy lights). Obviously most of this episode was the mystery of 

When Ezri turned to her artist brother and asked if he knew what happened to Marika I felt genuinely sick for a second. I was so wrapped up in the argument that it hadn’t even occurred to me. And he had that soft smile wrapped around his face... 

When Mom Ezri pleads with her to say it wasn’t her fault, my heart hurt. I blame my parents for so much... not all of it is fair, and I know that. But I wonder what would have happened if I broke before I moved to college. I wonder what Ezri thinks she could have accomplished if she had gone home sooner. Her brother snapped. She couldn’t have saved him from that. He still would have had to figure out who he was without his mother, AND without Ezri. And you have to wonder if he would have gotten through it. 

The Emperor’s New Cloak: There’s a mirror universe Vic! And he’s a bad guy! And somehow a real thing outside the holosuite. 

The sexualization of Kira in this show is both problematic and empowering in two very visceral ways. I have two very different strong feelings about it. The sexualization of Jadzia and Julian’s constant (almost creepy) chasing of women are also involved in those thoughts. Why is it creepy when it’s Julian but empowering when it’s Dax? I have no answers. Speaking of sexualization, this episode over sexualized lesbianism to me, which I don’t love. Representation? Great. Misrepresentation? Not so great.

I like that Garak in this universe is what he would have been if he hadn’t been exiled, but only sort of. He’s still subordinate in this universe, but also representing Cardassia.

I also just need to say how much I love Julian’s pirate look.

Why did mirror Worf just surrender? That’s completely unreasonable, even for mirror universe. 

Mirror Kira:“Isn’t it a little late to be developing a conscience?”
Mirror Ezri: “I sure hope not.”

I still don’t love the mirror universe episodes but this one was good. I had a good time. The characters felt more lively to me.

Field of Fire:
Nope. Can’t be done. You can’t go in the holosuite with Julian and Miles. 

“How was he killed?” “Well, there’s a gaping hole in his chest.” I think the Next Gen actors have talked about how scenes like that are hard to film because they’re aware that it’s a stupid question so they make a bunch of jokes. 

You can, uh, tell that the writers aren’t exactly crime novel experts. It was a pretty good buildup to a sort of silly solution. That said, I loved Ezri’s backstory, as I always do. I tend to think of the old host she was referring (names, names) as “The Composer” and not “The Murderer.” I thought of him as the one who went crazy and snapped, not as a calculated serial killer. The Prodigal Daughter episode was actually a significantly more successful version of this one to me, except it was more about Ezri and less about Dax. I don’t really think we needed both, especially not in row. The first one was super creepy, clever, well acted, and had an interesting answer. This one wasn’t quite so visceral. After that one this one was kind of disappointing.",startrek,MrPotato2753,False,/r/startrek/comments/hngim8/long_time_star_trek_fan_finally_watches_ds9/

7,“The Cloudminders” - First Time Viewing Reaction,1594211484,"Noob Trek 76 - The Cloudminders

I liked this. One of the better episodes of the season. It wasn’t mind-blowing, in fact the plot was fairly cliched, but the execution was solid and it seemed to have been written more thoughtfully without all the “but what about x and why did they do y” moments I’ve had after watching many recent episodes.

Spock and Kirk beam down to a planet to secure a load of plotonium and are immediately captured by a hipster breakdance crew. Wsee the economy of writing on display, understanding why Kirk was asked to beam to the council room instead but also why he ignored that instruction to save time. One minor niggle though is they really seem to be overdoing plague based stories, there‘s been quite a few recently I feel. Almost like this season‘s super powered beings or alternate earths.

It’s a good fight scene in the beginning, nice kinetic camera work, a mix of good clean hits and more chaotic moments. Seems like there’s been less fisticuffs this season.

Is this the old morlock/eloi story? Turns out that it is. However, my confident prediction that Droxine (incidentally the name of my new pharmaceuticals startup) is actually a sympathiser who is working against her father, she being the one who placed the digging tool in the art gallery, turns out to be totally wrong. The sculptures in that art gallery are pretty boss though. Speaking of Droxine, good heavens, put some clothes on young lady. Ewing looks great but her performance is sappy, and her voice which is at once breathless and childish rubs me the wrong way. Or is this a reflection of how this society has infantilised her? Interesting to see Spock get the incidental romance, it doesn't really go anywhere but adds an intriguing layer to the characters. Btw, what happened to the Spock/Chapel romance, it seems to have been dropped.

This narrated flashback by Spock is really unusual. Padding?

Meanwhile, Vanna is about to assassinate Kirk with an iron. I kind of wish she’d succeeded when he pins her to the bed and oilily declares ”I find this rather enjoyable.” Ugh. Speaking of Vanna, she does a good job of being a tough guy rather than the usual bimbos Kirk gets mixed up with; she even manages to make a fool of Kirk twice in the episode, not something many characters can claim. Her actress Charlene Polite has an amazing name. I like her. Jeff Corey is good too, taking a fairly standard character role of an officious/prejudiced establishmentarian and making his dialogue scenes watchable when they could have been tedious.  I like the “we have completely eliminated violence” edit - after the line we immediately cut to Vanna being tortured. Completely eliminated violence against themselves that is. However, Plasus’ order to kill Kirk on sight seems over the top, surely the situation doesn’t warrant that.

Scene with McCoy is interesting - they seem to be drawing parallels to the class warfare dialogues of 19th century England, in which some intellectuals argued that the working classes inability to “better themselves” could be attributed to the conditions around them, including exposure to fumes and bacteria which further disadvantaged their development. It is also reminiscent of statements that abolitionists or anti-segregationalists made in order to rationally explain negative perceptions or trends regarding racial minorities. Of course the version we get here from McCoy is extremely quick and tidy but it’s a 50 minute sci-fi show, what do you want.

Generally I find this episode to be well-written, with a lean, thought-out script. When Vanna and Kirk escape, they even remember about the transport passes established earlier, and Kirk closes the cell doors behind them. For once they even justify why Kirk is doing this mission personally, explaining that he doesn’t want anybody else to be responsible for his defiance of Plasus’ orders.

The lady eye makeup artist went to town this episode. I’m quite taken with Vanna’s purple eyes.

An episode in which people debate the merits of wearing filter masks is a bit close to home at the moment.

So they can just abduct people with the beam? Hmm, I’m pretty sure this won’t stay in canon. Being able to beam people around willy billy without their permission is highly problematic. Couldn’t you just teleport people into deep space to kill them or abduct them with extreme ease? Why have a war? Why not just teleport a hostile population into the sun? Why not teleport that Kilingon warship crew to ~~Wisconsin~~ ~~a black hole~~ Wisconsin?

Hmm, Droxine is into ears. To each their own.

This scheme is a bit wild for Kirk. And remember he cooks up this plan BEFORE he falls under the influence of the gas so that’s not the explanation. But he’s desperate to save that planet and doesn’t respect Plasus so there’s some justification for the measures he’s taking. Shatner does a good job of acting gradually more violent and irritable as the gas takes effect.

I like the way the digging instruments are built into the episode. Also nice little touches like the dialogue between Vanna and other miners that fleshes out their movement.

Interesting that the relationship between Plasus and Vanna remains hostile at the episode’s close rather than the usual “and everything was sunshine and smiles forever” ending you might expect. Kirk hasn’t taught Plasus his lesson. He’s cooperating but he’s sure not doing it willingly. But there’s hope for the future in Droxine’s attitude as, perhaps partly motivated by her attraction to Spock, she has begun a journey from bigotry to enlightenment. ”I no longer wish to be limited to the clouds“ is a great line.

So yeah, not too many crazy things to say about this episode, positive or negative. It’s a sci-fi adventure with some action and fist fights and guns and knives, but also a dollop of philosophy and social commentary and it does what it says on the tin. Hopefully this is indicative of the quality of the remaining few episodes.",startrek,Kayfim20,False,/r/startrek/comments/hng7il/the_cloudminders_first_time_viewing_reaction/

This respect for Sisko would have prevented Vreenak from being certain of the forgery. He examined it on his shuttle, and perhaps found some irregularities, but couldn't reasonably believe Sisko would have lied to him.

42,Thoughts on the Star Trek versus Star Wars Approaches to EUs,1594158590,"(TL;DR at the bottom)

Star Wars probably has one of the most well-known and expansive ""expanded universes"" of any major sci-fi franchise. I think it's also fair to say the Star Wars EU is fairly beloved among fans. A big part of the appeal was undoubtedly the fact that the Star Wars EU, unlike many other ""add-on"" products for big movie/tv franchises, were treated - more or less - as canon. Why would this matter for fan enjoyment? 

While you can of course point to various reasons, a big one (I would say) is the fact the writers of different novels, comic books, games respected (indeed, *had* to respect) the shared universe established by prior works. Accordingly, the various stories making up the EU were given a kind of ""weight"", in the sense that you were reading a story that you knew \*really\* mattered to the history and development of the Star Wars universe; a story that wouldn't simply be overridden or contradicted by the next book, comic, game, etc. So, on paper, having your expanded universe be canon seems like a pretty good idea in terms of providing output for the fandom.

However, the downside of such an approach is also well-known. As soon as the studio decides they want to produce a new show/movie, that carefully crafted expanded universe will be (at best) relegated to a source of inspiration for future material. This is, of course, exactly what we saw happen to the Star Wars EU, being re-branded to ""Legends"" and declared non-canon, leading to a noticeable number of Star Wars feeling frustrated with Disney's handling of their beloved universe.

Contrast this with the Star *Trek* approach to canoncity. While I'm not sure if they're official terms, Star Trek is known to have an ""alpha canon"" consisting of the series and films (and perhaps some other small stories that I'm forgetting) and a ""beta canon"". While the beta canon itself is not particularly well-defined (with Memory Beta simply referring to itself as the encyclopedia for any ""licensed"" Star Trek work), we know there is at least a rather sizeable collection of beta canon works, in the form of the Star Trek relaunch novels, that does present us with a well-developed, internally consistent ""expanded universe"". Nevertheless, this ""Star Trek EU"" has never been quite as accepted as canon.

Now, while the the Star Trek expanded universe has never really gained the massive following among Star Trek fans as the Star Wars expanded universe has among Star Wars fans (this is my impression, at least), there seems to have been an interesting trade-off where the lack of ""true"" canonicity of the Star Trek EU seems to have made it more robust, in the sense that there doesn't seem to have nearly as much outcry among Trek fans when a new show in the alpha canon (e.g. Star Trek Picard) contradicts the continuity of the expanded universe. Why? One reason is surely the fact that, as mentioned above, the Star Trek EU never had anywhere near the number of dedicated followers as the Star Wars EU. Another, more interesting perspective might be that because the Star Trek EU, while still being internally consistent and expansive enough to be of interest to fans, was never considered ""canon enough"" to be respected by future Trek series in the first place.

All in all, it seems the Star Wars and Star Trek EUs embody two different approaches to expanding on a franchise's canon. The Star Wars EU, being (formerly) in the same canon as the main movies and shows,  attracted a pretty sizeable following among the Star Wars fan base, but at the cost of being less robust (as exemplified by Disney's branding the Star Wars EU non-canon). The Star Trek EU, by contrast, was never considered to have the same level of canonicity as the tv series and films. While this may have had the downside of making the EU less central to the franchise, it had the advantage of being quite unaffected by the addition of new shows in the alpha canon. The lesson here seems to be that, instead of categorizing the different works in a franchise as either ""canon"" or ""non-canon"", it might be more useful for a franchise to adopt multiple ""degrees of canoncity"", with the alpha canon and beta canon (or, more specifically: the canon of the relaunch novels) of the Star Trek franchise being a nice example.

51,"The power of the butter knife in ""The Naked Time""",1594141640,"There are a great deal of amazing things that happen in the episode ""The Naked Time."" It is one of those Trek classics that is great from start to finish.  There are a few moments though that make me pause.  For example Lt.  Tormolen's suicide by way of butter knife.  I had no idea butter knives could be so powerful.  I understand 60s graphics weren't the best, but couldn't they have switched props for the up close shots with the knife?   Thus the poor sick Lt. (j.g.), the only Lt. (j.g.) we see in the classic Star Trek series, ends his life in one of the most bizarre ways: a butter knife.  

 Also at the end of this episode they uncover Star Trek's first method of time travel.  They never use it because they find more efficient ways of going back in time.  I did enjoy however Captain Kirk brainstorming with Scotty to the solution.  It shows Kirk isn't helpless in engineering matters.

55,TNG/DS9 Era Prop Phaser,1594138568," About a year ago I made the decision to get back into model building. It was something I had done to much joy as a teenager and that I picked up again in my late 20s. I built science fiction starships almost exclusively and loved every minute of it. Last year I dusted off an old Star Wars Rebel Base kit that somehow survived all these years and re-did a few of the small ships that came with it as a refresher. With my skills dusted off, I thought it was time for something more Star Trekkian.

I decided to fulfill a childhood fantasy by putting together and painting a prop replica model of a DS9/VOY era phaser. I always loved the design and as a kid I always wanted to have a screen accurate phaser. I ordered a prop replica kit back in March, just before the madness of the pandemic set in, and got to work on it shortly thereafter. I took pictures throughout the process and am really happy with how the final product turned out:

I think there's a really interesting story to be told there - a planet of hunter-gatherers that was occupied by the Cardassians or Breen (for resource extraction) but the planet had to be abandoned after the Dominion War.

Now, the planet's in federation space and they have to figure out what to do with them.

They'd been enslaved by the Breen for a generation, so the cultural damage has already been done - they can't go back to their natural development.  Does the Federation try to repair the damage and remove all technology from the planet?  Do they provide humanitarian assistance regardless of the further damage it might cause?

75,Long Time Star Trek Fan Finally Watches DS9: season 7 episodes 9 and 10,1594089177,"Hey guys! It’s going to be awhile since the next blog. I’m on my second out of unknown 12 hour shifts this week with no off days in the near future. We’re having some of those moments in Nor the Battle to the Strong. We’re honestly collapsing in on each other, skipping off days and diving into things. This blog is content I watched and wrote about earlier as I try to stick a couple episodes ahead but I haven’t watched since then and probably won’t until at least the end of the week. But we’re getting results out to possible COVID patients and we’re going to keep it up! 

I know that I didn’t reply to most of the comments on the last blog. I’m going to do as many I can before I fall asleep. I have read all of them! Some of you went into a pretty deep debate so I probably won’t get to reply to each argument but I’ll give some general thoughts. I read them when you guys comment but I mostly have time to read when I’m eating and can’t really type and eat at the same time. Alright, enough rambling!

Covenant: holy crap it’s a suicide pact. Uh... that’s not what I thought it was going to be. 

Well. This is definitely what I meant when I said I didn’t love this weird direction the show is going. I mean, it was still in character for Dukat since that episode where he and Sisko were stranded on a planet when Sisko was hurt. But guys the wraith thing is just so strange to me. I like the discussions the show is having about faith and religion but I also liked how it was counterbalanced by a scientific perspective on the same issues. The show has lost that balance.  I didn’t outwardly dislike this episode like I did with the finale of season 6, but it was definitely nowhere near my favourite. 

I think they could have improved this episode significantly just by flipping back and forth to the crew trying to get Kira back. It’s not like she was just kidnapped off the station and they found the transponder signal, then they just sat and waited for Dukat to invite them to save her. 

I think that Kira’s wrong about the Vedec. He didn’t lose his faith, and he didn’t feel betrayed by it. He still believed Dukat. He still believed this  is what the Pah Wraiths wanted for him. 

It’s Only a Paper Moon: I absolutely love this title. Something about it is completely captivating. Who is to tell me, with concrete evidence, that our moon consists of substance? How am I supposed to know? But I believe it. DS9 is toying a lot with the distinctions between religion, faith, and science. This is a kind of cool reflection on that. 

So what happened to patient confidentiality?

I love it when they all make fun of Julian’s holosuite programs. The ones which many of them have enjoyed extensively. Particularly Vic’s. I also love that we now have two medically focused characters on the show, Ezri and Julian, to discuss and agree/disagree. 

Nog’s mentality of “I didn’t think it would happen to me,” is so important. I’ve told this story on reddit as to why I don’t think kids should get their ears pierced, or at least without the consent of all parents involved in their lives. I had some ridiculous one in a million complications with chronic infections and metal sensitivities. And I don’t care how much you warned me at that age, I would never believe it could happen to me. That was a simple example. I see stuff like that everywhere now, odds, statistics. It’s a hard mentality to break but I think it’s worth the effort.

Awe guys Nog gave Vic a life. I love Vic. And I love his symbolism that somethings have to be learned from the past. They could have introduced a new crew member who was good with relationships but it wouldn’t have been the same. There’s something about Vegas, and the music style, and the slang, and the suits that just feels looser than Star Trek usually does. It’s funny because on Next Gen I didn’t love the holosuite episodes. I was watching the show to dream about the future, so I didn’t want to think about the past.

98,The most reliable piece of technology in the Federation TNG era,1594069422,"The single most reliable piece of technology in the TNG era at least was the Universal Translators. 

Think about it. No matter what disaster you had on the ship or space station, no matter what else was off line of being overwritten by alien viruses or going haywire, no matter what critical systems they were powering down, the universal translators always functioned. 

You might not notice this on a spaceship where in theory everyone might speak the same language since it might be conducive to functioning as a military to not be dependent on translator technology. But on Deep Space Nine, you've got dozens of alien species speaking all kinds of languages. If the translators ever failed, you'd notice it.

There are only three episodes where the translators functioned less than perfectly. Little Green Men- Quark, Rom, and Nog's Translators actually do short out and need to be fixed its the only time the technology actually breaks. Then there's an episode of DS9 in the first season when a Gamma quadrant species visits and the UTs aren't immediately able to translate their language but eventually the UTs get enough language samples to start working. Then there's Darmok where the Universal Translators are able to provide a literal translation but aren't able to properly convey the meaning of the aliens' speech. 

But that's a far better record than most Federation technology has. Think of all the times the holodeck safeties have failed, the warp drive has gone offline, warp core breaches, transporter malfunctions, sensors being unable to penetrate some kind of interference or another, even life support occasionally fails. 

The only other technology as reliable as the UTs is the artificial gravity. Even in the Year of Hell episode when Janeway was on her completely torn to hell Voyager, the artificial gravity was functioning like a champ.",startrek,CuriousGazelle0,False,/r/startrek/comments/hmgh4u/the_most_reliable_piece_of_technology_in_the/

They should have contrived it so that Worf wasn't on the station when it happened, that way Sisko is free and clear to be the one to have the last moment with Dax. 

To be fair I've thought of a counterargument to this, which is the fact that Dax and Sisko's relationship continues past Jadzia's death whereas Jadzia and Worf's marriage ends at this point.

1960s TV announcer voice: “Captain Kirk and his valiant crew have faced Klingons, Romulans, giant space monsters, powerful cosmic entities. Now they face the greatest terror of all, as a drum circle threatens to break out on the enterprise.”

  
Well.

That was a thing that I saw.

Thanks for reading the review and I’ll see you next time for The Cloudminders.

&amp;#x200B;

...

Damn, they're still here.

I guess I have to write this up then. Wait a second, I need something to keep me going.

(looking through album collection) Ya like Huey Lewis And The News? Their early stuff was a little too new wave for my taste, but when they released Sports in 1983, the refined, crisp clean production really gave the songs a boost that - ah, found it. (waves 666 by Aphrodite’s Child in the air)

After this episode I have a real appetite for a psychedelic classic to put on while I type up my review. I end up going with 666 by Aphrodite’s Child, which if you’ve never heard you really need to. It’s a double album too, so at 82 minutes\* it may just be long enough for me to process this episode of Star Trek what I just saw.

\*”82 minutes?” cry the no doubt numerous connoisseurs of 70s Greek psych rock who also frequent the Star Trek reddit. “But my copy of 666 only runs 77 minutes!” Ah, but I have the uncensored original pressing which contains 5 minutes of gorgeous Greek actress Irene Papas simulating an orgasm that was clipped from many issues of the album. Bet you want to hear it now huh?

Yes it’s quite the preamble this time isn’t it? It’s almost like I’m trying to delay something.

Now I have to say, I think this is going to be like Plato’s Stepchildren but more so in that I didn’t hate it but I suspect that many people will. The Way To Eden flirts with being one of the worst episodes of the show yet, but some intriguing and daring ideas plus a few laughs (albeit unintentional) save it from being a true piece of refuse.

The first thing I notice is Elizabeth Rogers sitting in for Uhura - why hello young lady. Shame she doesn’t do anything. I was kind of hoping she would join the hippies and take all her clothes off and run around. FOR DRAMATIC CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT PURPOSES.

They go to the transporter room and beam aboard the rascals escaping aboard the stolen vehicle. Oh no I moan to myself; LARPers. No wait, worse than LARPers, they’re Deadheads. One of them is called Tongo Rad, hahahahahaha, oh brother. And look at his costume. Is he played by Tim Heidecker? Rad also doesn’t matter very much despite him being presented to us as a big deal. Rad’s hair will continue to bother me throughout the episode, as will Sevrin’s sundried ears.

So clearly someone on the writing team heard A Piper At The Gates Of Dawn and was frightened. It’s a shame actually, because while the execution is comical, the idea of taking on hippy youth culture and protests with Kirk representing the man is quite daring. It’s funny today because we now know a lot of hippies would sell out when they realised they they were too soft to farm manually and they would become Gordon Gecko in twenty years time, but in the context of 1968 this would have been extremely contemporary and timely. They even reference dropping out with Irina’s quitting Starfleet, and Dr Sevrin appears to be an analogue for Timothy Leary.

I’ve mentioned this before but I’m a musical obsessive and music pub quiz champion and music is the thing I’m closest to being an expert on. Subsequently when I see an episode like this, which is drenched with a sort of clueless awareness of the Haight-Ashbury scene, things happen like Strawberry Alarm Clock‘s Incense And Peppermints playing on a loop in my head. Hey, did you know that Steve Bartek, who would be in Oingo Boingo later on with Danny Elfman, joined Strawberry Alarm Clock when he was only fifteen? Meanwhile Strawberry Alarm Clock guitarist Ed King left the band and joined Lynyrd Skynyrd and wrote Sweet Home Alabama for them. It seems part of my brain has recognised the danger this episode poses and is thinking of this stuff to prevent me from paying close attention to the actual show.

So a Herbert is a square? Why is Spock up on their hep lingo? Cut to Spock’s bedroom with a bunch of Phish posters on the wall. Kirk is in an unusual role as the fuddy duddy old heel, while Spock’s emotionless logical approach counterintuitive allows him to be more objective and open minded about the hippy ideas. “They regard themselves as aliens in their own world, a condition which I am somewhat familiar.” Good line.

You know what though, they‘re giving this a good try. Acting isn’t too bad (aside from one guy who I’ll skin alive momentarily) and yes the tone is a bit wide eyed and silly, but so is the premise of what they hippies are trying to do so it matches. I also don’t mind the made-up slang they use, it’s quite fun, cute even. Yes it doesn’t work if you take it deadly serious, but I don’t think we’re supposed to.

I’m just thinking this episode isn’t so bad and then the musical number starts. I’m surprised this sequence isn’t internet famous. Is that Quentin Tarantino playing the singing one? What awful lip synching and wigs. Why do they have fruit chalked on their foreheads? Why do they have eggs pinned to them? My brain starts to melt during this scene and there’s several more like it coming up. I actually started groaning aloud when the second song wouldn’t stop and my wife came in to see what was wrong, then looked at the screen and just about fell on her ass laughing. I’m sorry, but fuck Charles Napier. Fuck him. He’s the guy I mentioned before who drags this episode down - he’s screamingly awful and when he’s in focus this episode is just as bad as the legends say. It’s not just his insufferably terrible musical numbers, but every line he says, and his hair and his eyes and his clothes make me want to punch him in the face. When he dies I was like “Oh thank god” which rather undermined the tragic arc I imagine the show was going for. Imagine if they’d just hired Jefferson Airplane to play the hippies.

”Why do you wear all those clothes?” Irina says. Uh oh, here comes the love-in. Her own clothes are barely hanging on. Irina kinda grows on me - Russian accent is fake, but then so is Chekov’s, and she has a nice, believable air to her. Chekov meeting his ex is a good little touch, and again it’s nice to see a beefier role for the supporting cast.

Meanwhile out in the hallway, Sulu is in. I find the girl he is talking to cute/familiar and look her up and it was the useless yeoman from The Galileo Seven! (The entry also informs me that this actress, Phyllis Boyce, was a child actor in Gone With The Wind at age 3. The things we learn.) And even though she’s a minor role, I fall in love with Deborah Downey a bit.

At some point during this I begin to feel like I’ve taken something myself and I begin to lose the ability to write in paragraphs. All I can manage is the following scattershot observations.

I love how Spock has a conversation with Sevrin in which they attempt to reach an understanding of each other and then we hard cut to Spock saying “Dr Severin is insane”. Hilarious.

The Vulcan instrument which is both electronic organ and lyre is interesting. Does it have a name?

The conversation the hippies have about whether they can get the crew to “swing” has me all kinds of nervous.

These guard knockouts in this episode are among the lamest things the show has yet done. The pathetic squeaking the guards do too.

I do love the crewman on the bridge getting down to the music.

I like Kirk’s line that he used to get into a little trouble when he was that age, he has something of the reformed bad boy about him.

Why are the hippies disrupting the ship‘s activities when they’re trying to find Eden for them? They also pivot to murdering everyone on board pretty quickly. Those insane people huh.

How do they even identify Eden? Chekov describes a method of detecting unknown planets, but why is this particular one Eden?

Eden does look nice.

It’s our old pal the Galileo!

How/Why did Adam get off the shuttle before the others?

What was the point of that? There’s a severe lack of explanation/aftermath. So they found a planet the pronounced Eden, it was full of poison, two of them ate it and died. But why? Why is there a random poison planet believed to be a paradise? Wasn’t part of the legend about natives on the planet, what happened to them? Did I miss something or did the storyline about Sevrin’s illness go nowhere? What are they trying to say here? Hippy’s are idiots and their ideals are a deadly mirage?

Why did they keep bringing up the Romulans? It didn’t matter at all..

I would’ve paid cash money for Spock to close the episode by saying to Kirk “We reach... Herbert.”

Please tell me the official title for mods on the reddit is Herbert.

So yeah. You know what, maybe this is worse than I first thought. It‘s yet another episode that makes less sense the more you think about it, perhaps a misguided attempt to be groovy and way out to appeal to a youth audience, given how much time they spent on those musical numbers rather than adequately fleshing out the story. It was all like a strange dream, I’m having trouble even remembering it now. But flawed as this is in many many ways, it’s just too adorable for me to really hate it. I wouldn’t want Trek to be like this every week, but I’m glad it exists and I’ll take the occasaional WTF episode like this over dry, forgettable material like The Lights Of Zetar any time.

The lyrics themselves follow the same path, although I really don't like the concept of ""faith"" if intended in the literal sense: Star Trek is more rationality- and technology-driven and faith is usually respected but ""frowned upon"" by humanity as a whole.

45,"Just finished ENT for the 1st time ever; I'm nobody, but here's some thoughts",1593994656,"So my partner and I just finished ENT for the 1st time ever. I'm a nobody, but here are some raw, unedited, just-finished-5-minutes-ago stream of consciousness thoughts. opinions only.

Background: I grew up as a 90s kid. TNG was my first exposure and 1st love of trek. I remember being in Good Guys as a 7 yr old with my dad, and Undiscovered Country was what they were playing on all the TV screens in the display area. I've seen every episode of  each Star Trek series, including DSC and PIC, except that I've only seen some episodes of TOS(The Cage, the Menagerie, most of the ""classics"") and the animated series. I've seen every single Star Trek movie. The only reason I did not see every episode of ENT until today was because it aired while I was away in college.

&amp;#x200B;

Enterprise, an interesting attempt to revive the franchise, with many interesting ideas and high points though with many low points, too.

Highs, for me:

\-T'Pol, in general, was a great character. Hard to top Spock and Tuvok (Tuvok, and Tim Russ, are so underappreciated!), but T'Pol was great. During many times I almost gave up on ENT, T'Pol helped me to persevere.

\-Seeing the founding planets interact, especially Jeffrey Combs as Shran

\-learning more about Andoria

\-Tripp genuinely won me over by the end. i absolutely hated him at the start.

\-the Xindi storyline took forever to get to the point, but once it did, it led to several really great episodes back to back. I see they were experimenting with episodic/serialized episodes.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Parts I did not like:

\-the vulcan wigs were SO bad! they were a constant source of laughter for us

\-overall, the ENT episodes did not have the same ""moral of the week"" feel as the 90s series did. the 90s series felt more creative in the premise they would set up for each episode. the episodes of ENT were a little more sloppy and a lot less deep. some of the best episodes of TNG/DS9/VOY leave you with food for thought, but rarely did that happen with ENT. It was a much more shallow experience.

\-it was obvious there was a lot of network interference and also a significant impact from 9/11. to elaborate, i'm referring specifically to moments like when Archer ""had to do what he had to do"" and attacked a helpless ship to steal their warp coils or something, stranding them in hostile territory(sure he gave them food but it was still stealing by force). there was also some very militaristic aspects, which i guess reflect the just-after-9/11 era. I remember a lot of things from back then other than star trek were very influenced by the post-9/11 atmosphere (freedom fries, the way some things were being advertised during that time frame, etc). I was not into the macho-macho stuff. when malcolm the tactical officer and the head MACO got into a fist fight? it was so laughably bad. some of it was a little overboard, especially when you compare it to 90s set of series.

\-Mayweather and Malcolm(the British guy in case I have his name wrong which I often do) were so terrible. I feel bad for the actors, but they were given nothing to do. Those characters were so bland and boring, i had a hard time remembering their names half the time. When Malcolm wasn't being boring, he was being annoying, like nails on a chalkboard kind of annoying.

\-sadly, i thought the actor who played the vulcan ambassador throughout all 4 seasons was not very good at being ""Vulcan,"" and I hated whenever he showed up

\-VOY had better special effects. the VFX for ENT were sadly pretty bad.

\-I feel bad for the cast about their finale episode, since they kind of got shafted in their finale. The focus was all on Riker and Troi. However, as a fan, i do have to say that seeing Troi and Riker (which I did not expect) was a very pleasant surprise. I was smiling ear to ear seeing Troi and Riker and the Enterprise D again. and OMG data on the comm channel! Riker as chef!! Riker as chef made the PIC episode with Riker EVEN better in hindsight!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

overall, I'm happy that I was able to finally watch all of ENT. I may have listed many flaws, but I still do appreciate ENT as a part of Star Trek history, even with its flaws. although, having said that, i must say that my partner and i both agreed we each personally enjoyed the first 2 seasons of DSC and 1st season of PIC way, WAY more than all of ENT. I'm still glad I watched ENT, though. I will miss these characters, even if I don't feel as fond of them as I do with characters like Riker, Dax, Worf, etc.

Ultimately, I guess I view ENT as a fun romp within the Trek universe that is marred by the era in which it was produced (immediately after 9/11) and also marred by obvious network interference to ""sex it up"" or ""make it more macho."" In a way, ENT felt like a de-evolution from the TNG-VOY era, though it was still an overall fun experience.

47,DS9 Rewatch: Worf is a terrible officer,1593993659,"Warning: This may be an unpopular opinion.

With his introduction on DS9, Worf entered the command track, but he never really lost that security perspective.  Although that may work in certain situations, when hard decisions had to be made, he made the wrong choice at almost every turn and acted with emotion rather than logic or discipline.  I get that he's a Klingon, but he was raised on Earth and it seems he would have picked up on some of this.

He ignored orders every so often

He constantly shows a startling lack of restraint.  For example, while Sisko is defending him in an extradition matter, Worf attacks Ch'Pok, undermining Worf's claim that he would never attack an unarmed man and ends up putting Sisko in a terrible position.  And this is not the only time his anger put him in a bad situation.

He destroyed what people thought was a cargo ship without verifying that fact.  He saved Jadzia even though it wrecked a mission.  While I understand that one and it may make him a good person, it doesn't make him a good officer.

There are a bunch of other examples throughout DS9 that demonstrate just how bad an officer he is.

48,Sisko's Journey After What We Leave Behind,1593989228,"Before starting this theory I would like to say I am aware the vast majority of Deep Space Nine was never planned out much in advance, and was written largely as the story went on. So while I post this theory, I do not believe there is really one ""true"" of ""correct"" history surrounding the Prophets and Sisko (outside of DS9's 7 years) because it was never in the writers mind. Also for those of you Discovering DS9 for the first time thanks to the modern stuff, there will be major spoilers for the entirety of DS9 up to the finally. So with that aside,

I just finished re-watching the season 6 episode ""The Reckoning"" (check the memory Alpha summary if you don't remember it). But what really stuck with me this time was the vision Sisko received from the Prophets in one of the opening scenes. In the scene Sisko visited the previously unknown ruins under the holy city of B'hala which itself was previously uncovered by Sisko himself. In that vision the prophets immediately state ""the circle is complete"", and latter that the Reckoning (which we latter learn to be the upcoming battle) is the ""end or the beginning"", and that Sisko is ""of Bajor"" again.

The circle being completed is most interesting, because that means from this exact moment we can create a chain of events which ultimately lead to either this event, or some previous event required for this visit to the tablet by Sisko (such as his own birth). We also know the Prophets can act ""out of order"" as, from our perspective, they ""create"" prophecies about Sisko, engineer his birth, then meet him with absolutely zero idea who he is, what existence outside the wormhole is, or even the most basic concepts about our universe such as death and time. From the line that this is ""the end or the begging"" we can assume that chain of events starts here, and from the rest of the series I think we can draw a rough history of what Sisko does ""after"" What We Leave Behind.

Lets start with the chain just before this event and work backwards. Before finding the tablet, Bajor has to discover the city under B'Hala. Before that they need to Discover B'Hala and for that to happen Sisko needs to discovery it by studying that art with the spire. In order for that art to exist, somebody had to paint it about 20,000 years ago. It may seem obvious, but for that to happen B'Hala has to exist. But why does B'Hala exist? We know it is basically Bajoran Mecca, the holiest site to the Bajoran people and a city of great importance. But we never know WHY it's so holy. There is no Bajoran Jesus or Mohamed (well, except for Sisko), and no real religious events that happen on Bajor, as far as we know, that are the cause of most holy sites on Earth.

What we DO know is B'Hala was built directly above what was a 5,000 year old city that housed a holy artifact mentioning the Emissary. That doesn't just happen by accident. Furthermore modern Bajorans knew ""virtually nothing"" of the people that built the city and didn't even know it existed until they started excavating B'Hala. So presumably what they do know comes from studying these newly disocvered ruins. I put forth B'Hala exists because this other city, lets call it ""Tablet City"", existed before it.

Lets now move forward from the discovery of the tablet. We know the events of the episode lead to a battle where either the circle will ""begin or end"". We also know this battle did not finish in this episode, but we do know what happened to Kosst Amojan. According to Memory Alpha they latter attempted to stop Sisko from opening the Orb of the Emissary, and eventually was most likely the entity which possessed Gul Dukat in the finally (bassed off what Kia Winn sais when working with Dukat). Interestingly if we we take a look at Dukat's life, it was Sisko's actions that directly made Dukat realize he wanted to kill all the Bajorans and pursue his path with the Pah-Wraiths.

I put forth that the battle between Dukat and Sisko in What We Left Behind is in fact the Reckoning, happening after the first attempted battle failed. After this Reckoning, Sisko went to join the Prophets and continue his non-linear work with them. It's interesting to note Lower Decks seems to suggest Bajor has joined the Federation (with the Bajoran captain) and Discovery shows the Federation having collapsed after roughly 800 years (giving Bajor, more or less,1,000 or peace and prosperity. Maybe 800 years is 1,000 Bajoran years). Of course the writers couldn't have known either of those things but still.

So in order to complete the circle, I say that Sisko went back in time, either being born again as a Bajoran or just as himself, at the location that would become Tablet City and guided the Bajoran people in the way of the Prophets. Maybe even founding the religion. He could even have been a part of banishing the Pah-Wraiths from the temple further entwining him in their circular history. Because such an event would be hugely significant, the city became a holy site and, 5,000 years after it's destruction for whatever reason, B'Hala was built as a new holy city and in the intervening 20,000 years the legends of Sisko's arrival were forgotten or mixed up in so much re-translated metaphor and prophecy that it's completely unrecognizable (and perhaps becomes the prophecies Sisko learns and studies himself on DS9). Sisko, at some point, builds the tablet he latter discovers, trapping a Prophet and Kosst Amojan, so that he can latter Discover that tablet and set off the chain of events that lead to the defeat of the Pah-Wraiths.

Or not. If that battle hadn't been stopped by Kia Winn, one of two tings would have happened. The Prophet would have one, meaning what I just described (minus the bits between the battle then and the one with Dukat) would have happened and the circle would ""begin"". Or Kosst Amojan would have won, Sisko would have died with the station and the Pah-Wraits would re-take the wormhole, the events described would never have happened, and the circle would ""end"". Hence ""this is either the end or the begging"".

I would even go as far to say that Sisko might be the entity that possesses Kira in this episode. In the past, Sisko locks himself in the tablet with Kosst Amojan after banishing the Pah-Wraiths to the fire caves. (From our perspective,) Sisko is then born half Prophet, without his non-linear insight, and lives his life eventually freeing himself and Kosst Amojan from the tablet. Both then leave DS9 after failing to have their battle and begin plotting for the next fight. Sisko with the rest of the Prophets trying to get BaJor through the war and Kosst Amojan finding Dukat and leading him down the path of the Pah-Wraiths (note all of Dukat's actions with the Wraiths happen not long after this episode. This includes killing Dax who came up with the idea to flood the station with harmful radiation in the first place. Dukat's studies of the Bajoran texts could have even started thanks to interference by Kosst Amojan). When the time is ready for the fight, Prophet Sisko merges with Sisko at Vic's in What We Leave Behind in the instant we see where he suddenly knows what he has to do and runs off to Bajor. From that point on Sisko seems to have the non-linear insight that he only ever had once, when he had those visions after an orb experience (which were ended prematurely).

You may say that Sisko can't be the Prophet because then when he interacts with the Prophets in the pilot there would one who is like ""oh ya, I get this, I'm that guy after all."" But if Sisko is in a Tablet on Bajor during the early events of DS9 he would never have interacted with himself.

This explanation fits the prophecy, and explains why ""the Sisko is of Bajor"". He is literally from Bajor as well as Earth. Is it circular and in places paradoxical? Yes but so are the Prophets themselves and the things we know they do. It also doesn't contradict the common fan theory that the Prophets are future Bajorans. If anything it adds to that theory as Sisko's actions in the past would essentially set Bajor on the path to becoming the super religious society that listens to the Prophets who are trying to safeguard their own existence.

I believe this is the story of Sisko's life and I would love to see what other people might add to it.",startrek,Official_N_Squared,False,/r/startrek/comments/hlvy6p/siskos_journey_after_what_we_leave_behind/

74,“Requiem For Methusaleh” - First Time Viewing Reaction,1593953358,"Noob Trek 74 - Requiem For ~~Liberace~~ Methuselah

Another boring episode BUT HEAR ME OUT, this one was boring in a classy way. It was boring with purpose and style. By which I mean is that this is probably the most light on action/thrills episode we’ve yet had, but this was by design, not incompetence. It’s a very chill, relaxed episode, sort of like Squire Of Gothos meets What Are Little Girls Made Of, only without the antagonism - there isn’t a villain, or if there is, he’s not much of a villain. No, this episode almost seems like a direct retort to the comment at the end of my last review where I complained that Season 3 Trek lacks philosophy, as this one is relatively heady.

Like last time, a fast paced opening belies a gently paced episode. As we join our crew a plague is already raging. We never learn where it came from but given Kirk’s behaviour later on it’s a fair bet he transmitted it to everyone in the crew.

The crew beam down to the planet where an ageing Liberace, or at least a man in Liberace’s curtains, is in possession of the substance needed to cure the plague. I will say after a few visually shabby episodes, this looks quite nice. Sets are well appointed and the backdrop/model for the exterior view of Flint’s fortress is stunning. I am a bit concerned when Flint leans in to kiss his presumed daughter on the mouth, though in the episode‘s defence this is explained later on. While this episode is very quiet, one thing that lets it get away with it is Louise Sorel as Rayna. In addition to her striking looks, she gives one of the best guest performances in a while, really nailing the tone of an uncannily human android, with something almost real yet unearthly, alien, touched, about her. Her gradual emotional awakening and the steeliness that develops are portrayed well, and she gives a great look of hate at Flint later on when he threatens Kirk. Daly as Flint is a bit flat, but this may be intentional to reflect the weariness of the character.

I like how Spock is so excited by the riches of Flint’s art collection that he actually needs a brandy to calm his nerves. This may be more important than it seems, as this moment shows McCoy reading Spock’s character wrong, something that may be critical for a correct understanding of the ending. BTW, why would Vulcans appreciate music?

The first half of this episode is really unusual. Nothing much happens but not in the tedious time-wasting way of say The Mark Of Gideon or The Immunity Syndrome. Here it seems to be an intentional tonal decision, the performances, direction and dialogue crafted to deliberately avoid the usual tropes of conflict so as not to paint Flint as a villain and give the episode a different flavour. The lack of suspense and thrills isn’t something I dig, but it’s neat to see the show try something other than the usual mad scientist/super being cliches. We get to see the away team just hang out and interact with an advanced alien being for once.

Kirk you lech. He seems really horny in this episode, and the way he and Rayna go from 0 to 60 in their relationship doesn’t ring true, but I guess that’s a side effect of resolving everything in 50 minutes. I don’t like how possessive he gets of her when he tells her she loves him, or that he is so intent on nursing his boner he forgets about the plight of the crew and Spock has to remind him several times. I waited for this mania to be explained as it was in Elaan of Troyius and it isn’t - it seems that Kirk just couldn’t keep it in his pants this episode.

The explanation of Flint’s immortality is pretty lame. He’s just randomly biologically immortal? Come on guys you can do better than that. I thought they were going to make him the Wandering Jew or something like that. However they did get me with the revelation that he IS all these geniuses of the past, that was a neat touch, I assumed he had only met them.

Kirk looking through the tiny Enterprise view screen is hilarious.

So is this episode essentially about how Kirk is irresistible to women? At least it’s a key plot point. Anyway though, we have a Pygmalion episode here, where Flint has created his ideal companion but in making her a real person finds she is no longer ideal as a real person cannot be ideal. Sorel acts the transformation into a self determined being very well, but the wheels come off a bit as the show commits the cardinal “tell don’t show” sin by having Spock narrate the dramatic climax of the episode and it’s some corny “robots cannot love” stuff too which is disappointing.

However things get a bit more interesting when we have a coda of Kirk actually giving a shit about this week’s lost love. Why Rayna gets this distinction above the likes of Edith or Miramanee I’m not sure but it’s still a progression and Kirk even calls himself a lonely man.

When Spock leans over the sleeping Kirk at the end I thought he was finally going in for the kiss.

”Forget.” On the one hand this is incredibly touching. Is that why McCoy’s scolding of Spock happens right before this, because this is Spock demonstrating love? On the other hand it’s really invasive and maybe a massive violation of command protocol. I’m pretty sure editing a captain’s memory without permission or medical oversight would be a court martial offence and therefore outrageously out of character for Spock. On the third hand we finally have an in-canon explanation as to why nobody ever remembers the various wives and loved ones they leave strewn throughout the galaxy. Wish Spock had done that to me after The Alternative Factor.

So yeah, as I’ve already noted this was quite dull, but I can appreciate that it was fairly well made and stands above the shoddiness/thoughtlessness of the last few episodes. Had Rayna’s ending been tweaked to avoid the “cannot compute love” conclusion and Spock’s narration, or had a more engaging actor played Flint, I think it could have even quite good. Still, this script and production seemed like someone gave a shit about them, which is more than I could say for The Lights Of Zetar, so thats heartening.",startrek,Kayfim20,False,/r/startrek/comments/hlm3s3/requiem_for_methusaleh_first_time_viewing_reaction/

76,Long Time Star Trek Fan Finally Watches DS9: Season 7 episodes 5-8,1593949423,"I was wondering why I didn’t hear from anyone on this post and then I realized I didn’t post it. Sorry guys I try not to miss two days in a row but holy crap I’m so tired.


Chrysalis: oh my heart is melting. I’m going to cry, aren’t I? Oh god I’m going to cry. 

I love, love, love watching Julian care so deeply. It’s mesmerizing. It’s optimistic. There’s joy there that I hope I can find someday. 

I knew this episode was going to be heartbreaking when it started. I will say that this is the third time Julian has asked how he could be so arrogant to do something. I understand why he broke ethical codes here. He is never going to find someone who understands him the way she does. So that... hurts. But he definitely did the wrong thing. He took advantage of an emotionally vulnerable patient. I think Julian needs to chat with Ezri. I didn’t realize how painfully lonely he is when Miles isn’t there. That hurts. 

Julian was... a little creepy in this, and I acknowledge that. But I still love him. I want him to be happy and I’m so sorry that he wasn’t because Serena would have been beautiful with him. 

Treachery, Faith, and the Great River: this was a solid Odo episode. Sad, certainly. Most Odo episodes are sad. But I appreciate it for what he did. Someone asked for asylum. He took it as prisoner, but it was asylum. It was saving someone’s life, even at the risk of bringing a Vorta back with him.

One thing that is both a positive and a negative about DS9 is that they didn’t look for a creative way out. Not that the Vorta gave him much time to think. But I feel like in other Star Trek series, they would have engineered a highly unlikely, crazy way to get out of that situation. I just want people to stop dying on this show! Anyone! Good guys, bad guys, seriously guys let’s just play baseball or dislocate our shoulders kayaking. I absolutely love these characters and would just as much love to watch a day in Kira’s life or read Julian’s research, or follow Miles around doing his puttering. Or now watch Ezri counsel (I feel like that would be hysterical). But no we need to watch Odo start to care about his very own pet Vorta, and have his pet Vorta kill itself. Because we know Odo feels responsible for that death, even though he couldn’t have avoided it by any reasonable means.

The Miles/Nog plotline in this episode stressed me out on so many levels. Watching Miles get in trouble over and over again, and then having things set in motion to the point where he couldn’t stop it. Sisko was just a little unreasonable, don’t you think? I understand the usual “Chief says he can do it in 8 hours so he has 2,” situation. As a scientist, I admittedly regularly overestimate the length of time a task should take when asked when I can get something done by. Wiggle room. But like... the thing is out of stock for the next two weeks. “I want it done in three days!” Uh... no? 

Once More Unto Breach: I liked this episode a lot. Worf was kind of a jerk, offering an officer position to someone who the captain explicitly couldn’t stand... not cool. But I love the whole heroic Klingon battle. I love the sneaking out and hypospraying Worf so he could sacrifice himself in a final glorious battle. The entire thing was thrilling to me. I like Klingon space battles more than Federation space battles. I love the singing, the aggressiveness, the way they are louder. It feels more passionate and alive than Federation ones. Honestly the Federation space battles on DS9 are kind of depressing (for good reason, of course). Obviously I disagree with the Klingon celebration of their killing massive numbers of people but they sure make a compelling argument. 

DS9 feels much more realistic to me (as realistic as you can consider something this deep in science fiction). The Federation battles are largely depressing. The characters are talking about their friends dying. They’re talking about the good man that captain that vessel that was lost this week. There isn’t always a crazy, insanely unlikely but we pull it off anyway way out of a bad situation. I’m proud of myself for not disliking for that. In fact I think it’s a high point of the show. There have been episodes (like the next one) that are just brutal, painful, but I need to understand that. Because I know it represents perspectives on real events that I need to understand. I relate to this series, despite it being completely unrelateable on the surface. And even when I don’t, I have this need to learn from it, because I see a lot of value in it.

All that said the Klingon battles are still more fun. 

The Siege of Ar-558: let’s get serious again. Oh, my God. 

Quark says that Sisko wouldn’t send Jake on a dangerous assignment, to which Sisko says that Jake isn’t a Star Fleet officer. That doesn’t sit right with me and I’m not sure why. I would say that we shouldn’t send anyone on blatantly, impossibly unsafe missions but someone has to go. Someone with the skills and expertise. And officers signed up, while civilians didn’t. I personally made that particular distinction multiple times. In particular, in Nor the Battle to the Strong, I think that Jake was too hard on himself. He wasn’t trained for that situation, he had no idea what to do, or how hr would react. So it’s not fair for me to say that that’s my problem with it. Ground warfare is just so different than in space. People are injured, there’s not enough supplies, they’re immobile, can’t get to hospitals, can’t contact help, help can’t get to them. 

I like Ezri’s comment that a few hours before she found all the mines, they were considered too ruthless for anyone but the Jem’Hadar to use. And then another soldier comments on how confident Julian is with the phaser rifle. Meanwhile Vic’s voice echoes through the cave. It was entirely haunting. 

I feel obligated to comment on Quark. I feel like he took away from the seriousness of the final battle but it was obviously immense growth for his character. He also put forward that ethical argument that I’m still struggling with. 

Every part of this episode was entirely brutal in a good way. Something about these ground war episodes really get to me, maybe because we don’t see them too often. And Sisko’s change from start to finish was beautiful. He talks about how the casualties have blurred together for him at the beginning, versus at the end how he can’t forget how they were individual, human people. I’ve always found this completely transfixing about the Vietnam Memorial. I am personally incapable of not seeing each and every name on that wall as a human person, with a life and a family, that was ended too soon and too brutally. I don’t ever have to meet them to know that they deserved to live. I have cried a lot at that memorial. I am also crying now.

78,"Discussion about the movement of starships in space, &amp; space anomalies on Star Trek shows.",1593947408,"I’m currently watching Star Trek Enterprise Season 2 Episode 12 titled “The Catwalk”, and it brought up a question I’ve asked myself many times in the past while watching other Star Trek shows.

Put simply, why can’t they go up above, or down below, or around things coming at them? Especially since they have the ability to move in every direction.

Now I understand that something like a blast that has a shock wave would be going outward in every direction so you wouldn’t have any chance to go up over it or down below it ect. While some episodes do explain that whatever is coming at them, or they are approaching is so wide that it would be impossible, or would just take to long to go around.

And even in this episode they state that the wave front spans more than half a dozen light years, obviously to wide to just go around the sides, and they can’t outrun it, due to lack of speed, since they are limited to a warp 5 engine. 

However later in the captains ready room he is looking out the window at the wave front coming towards the ship. While it looks very wide, it doesn’t appear to be that tall or thick.

What I don’t understand is why they are not able to move the ship into a higher or lower spot in space than they are currently sitting thereby avoiding the wave front all together.

It would appear since it’s not very thick that they could move themselves up above the top of the wave front and just go over it. Or that they could move themselves far enough under it, that it would just pass overhead and never bother them.

Especially since space is a four dimensional endless vacuum, with tons of room for them to pull this off. Granted there is the possibility that the wave front could move itself up, or down, and still hit them if they didn’t move far enough above or below the wave front, but the visual we see doesn’t appear to be moving any direction other than a straight line towards them.

So why do they choose to just sit there in the line of fire and wait for it to hit them, instead of trying to avoid it, especially since they have the ability to move the ship far enough up above or below the wave front to let it pass without ever being anywhere near it, or it near them?

While I realize it would make the show far less interesting if they just did what I’m suggesting, I think it would be far more logical than what they are doing, by cramming everyone into the catwalks and staying in the path of the wave front, hoping the radiation won’t seep into the warp nacelles and or kill everyone. 

Why take the risk, if you don’t have to?

Does anyone have any idea or suggestion as to why they chose not to just move the ship as I’m suggesting?

Or why they can't move the ship like I'm suggesting?

Or why they can't avoid the wave front at all?

80,Being a Q fan in a Q-Anon world...,1593944008,"I've always been a big fan of the Q continuum, and its conceptualization in TNG especially. As such, I have spent a great deal of time postulsting about what kind of effect a semi-benevolent, omnipotent, and omnipresent being would have upon humanity. Q stands in almost stark contrast to the ""godhood"" figures of most religions in that he is totally willing to demonstrate his existence, his power, and his recklessness on a consistent basis. Yet, he is not seeking to be worshipped in the general sense, but is rather seeking to be ""liked"" or appreciated as it were. I find that fascinating because Q has taken the opportunity, potentially our of sheet boredom, to explain to what he views as the most advanced humans he could find (especially and specifically Picard) what they should be preparing for in their next phase of evolution. This is done as both a preview as well as a warning I believe. It is actually extremely thoughtful of Q to do this when you look at things from his point of view. He is prepping humanity for their journey into the unknown as they transcend their current limitations and leap technologically or biologically out of their mortal shackles.

Now here is my frustration:

This amazing piece of writing that inspired my own awakening, drove me to ask profound philosophical questions (and re-examine my own worldview), has been seemingly coopted by one of the most interesting LARPs of all time in the form of Q-Anon. It seems almost certain that whoever this person is has paid homage to the concept of Q from Star Trek, and is using some of these tropes to manipulate people in the same fashion as Q from Star Trek sans any of the benevolent behavior. Doesn't it seem strange to anyone else that this anonymous figure, who fancies himself as politically omnipresent has captured the attention of seemingly millions of people who follow him with an almost religious like fervor? Doesn't that seem a little bit too convenient? Maybe I am just seeing patterns where there are none, but I just cannot help but feel whoever this person (or persons) are that they have used the Q model of behavior to manipulate an ENORMOUS number of impressionable people.

I know probably nobody will see this, but if you do let me know if you think there is some connection between Q in Star Trek and the methodology being enacted by Q-Anon. I'd love to hear all of your opinions on the matter because this is something that has bothered me for a while.

TLDR: Q-Anon seems to be using a lot of the same manipulation tactics (sans the benevolence) of Q in Star Trek to manipulate people's thinking and beliefs. Do you think there is a purposeful connection there, and that some random Trekkie lost their way by becoming one of the most prolific LARPers of all time?",startrek,Riccosuave,False,/r/startrek/comments/hlkbks/being_a_q_fan_in_a_qanon_world/

17,It’s interesting how many things enterprise does that later Star Treks get attacked here for regularly.,1593884087,"I’m about halfway through season 3 of ENT, and when I finish I’ll have watched every minute of live action Star Trek, minus Picard. I should specify at the top that I’m enjoying it. It’s got problems, and I can’t imagine it’ll wind up being one of my favorites, but the main cast is good and it’s certainly had it’s moments. 

But I’ve noticed at least two big things it does that JJ Trek and DSC get ripped for a lot, and I’ve never heard anyone say the same about ENT. 

First I think the Temporal Cold War, which is my least favorite element of the show, falls into the same trap as “Michael is Spock’s sister” on DSC. They have prequel problems—major events happen that are never mentioned again other shows. But more than that, I think it reflects a lack of trust in your new characters. “Don’t care about these people because they’re interesting,” the shows seem to say, “care about them because of the way they relate to people you already like.” 

Second, and this is the one that inspired the post, is how much vitriol has been directed at the JJ movies for “turning Star Trek into Star  Wars.” Imagine my surprise when &gt;!the fucking Death Star!&lt; shows up at the beginning of ENT season 3. And then an even more explicit version shows up in a vision of the future. And then there’s a scene with the Xindi sitting around &gt;!looking at their Death Star plans!&lt; that’s ripped RIGHT from Attack of the Clones which would have been about a year old at this point. 

I’m on record as thinking Trek 2009 is one of the most watchable action movies ever, Into Darkness is an ok movie with a mess of a third act, and Beyond is a fun but empty long episode of the show. But I definitely think JJ is getting a little too much blame for copying a certain other huge sci fi franchise after watching season 3 of ENT.",startrek,Earthshoe12,False,/r/startrek/comments/hl779f/its_interesting_how_many_things_enterprise_does/

22,"TNG: ""Thine Own Self""",1593877078,"Leaving aside the obvious connection to the famous quote, and how it applies to Data and Troi, this was an interesting episode.

Even without access to the wealth of information stored in his memory, Data intuited the structure of matter, created the microscope, developed the scientific method, proved the existence of unseen radioactive particles and using these ideas created a cure for radiation poisoning.

After he was killed because the villagers thought he was a monster bringing disease, he was later buried in honor with a shrine in his memory.

All of this would've have made for a great call-back episode.

First, the Prime Directive prohibits interference with an alien culture's natural progression. By introducing so many scientific discoveries Data would have advanced their understanding of physical science by hundreds of years in the span of a few days. It would be interesting to see how quickly their scientific understanding evolved and its' affect on their culture.

Second, Data was beamed from underground back to the Enterprise.

If the villagers discovered he had ""risen from the dead"" it would be interesting to see a religion created around Data as a messianic figure.

29,“The Lights Of Zetar” - First Time Viewing Reaction,1593862296,"Noob Trek 73 - The Lights Of Zetar

Hmm.

A full review follows but if you’re pressed for time you can probably stop reading now because “hmmm” just about covers it. A dull episode which is competent to a fault, The Lights Of Zetar lacks anomalies that make it either risible or memorable. This will probably be a short one, there isn’t a lot to say. It was a tough review to write and I won’t be surprised if you find it a poor read - I just wasn’t inspired by this, either to praise or scold. The Lights Of Zetar occupied my screen for fifty minutes and then it didn’t and there wasn’t a lot beyond that. You take Where No Man Has Gone Before, extract the intrigue that episode Had, mix it with Metamorphosis and you have this.

I will say though it was cool to see Memory Alpha and learn that’s where the name for the premiere Star Trek info site comes from. Right back when I started doing this marathon, I would google bits and bobs from the episode and would invariably be referred to Memory Alpha. For example this episode the thing I look up is WHAT? WRITTEN BY SHARI LEWIS? Quick check on Memory Alpha, and yep it’s that Shark Lewis. I remember seeing Lamb Chops Playalong as a kid, I quite liked it too. Had no idea she’d written an episode of Star Trek, weird. Mind you, it makes total sense given the way Romaine is a sock puppet for the Zetans, boom tish.

Scotty sure cuts to the chase here, romancing the babe of the week within seconds of the episode beginning. This rapidity is rather misleading as most of the rest of the episode will be slow as a wet weekend. And what’s with the art house stylings all of a sudden. “His heart once throbbed only to the ship’s engines” accompanied by a bizarre diving birds eye view on the command chair, the lights exploding in Romaine’s eyes. They’re very pretty lights though, they work as a little Fourth of July fireworks show given I’m watching it on that day. At least the lights looks good, given how much time we spend looking at them

Calling it one minute in - Romaine dies and her mind gets put in Memory Alpha. And I turn out to be totally friggin’ wrong but I still say my idea might have made for a better episode.

The most interesting aspect of the episode for me is the well done sound and lighting effect when the lights are taking over a person. The death of the technician at Memory Alpha with the flashing coloured face and unintelligible voice is quite spooky and for the millionth time I lament an obvious horror direction the show doesn’t go in.

I find it somewhat implausible that a resource as invaluable as Memory Alpha is unprotected despite Spock’s explanation. A welcome moment of humour comes when Kirk chastises Scotty for mooning over Romaine in the sick bay. ”Will I find the doctor in engineering?” However in general I don’t find the Scotty/Romaine romance or how she is handled to be very palatable. Scotty’s condescending attitude to Romaine is gross, the way he talks to a woman he presumably wants to date like a mentally deficient five year old. Shutan isn’t the problem, she works with the material she has, but the script treats her like a prop. She’s in the room during the briefing seen and people talk like she isn’t there. Can’t she speak for herself? Why does Scotty have to explain how she feels and creepily drape his arms all over her while he does it. She needs a man to support her or both sides as she is passively carried to her fate and during the big finale she will lie very still doing nothing while Kirk nearly kills her, having never asked her opinion or for any input from her on the situation. I feel like the show is actually getting MORE sexist in its final days. It seems odd, as you imagine shows become more progressive over time, but something similar happened on Doctor Who. They had a companion called Liz who was very sensible and not a hottie and smart enough to challenge the Doctor and viewers didn’t like it so she got dumped and replaced with a supernaturally incompetent woman-baby called Jo who just fell over and got in the way and constantly needed saving.

I have time to think these things because it’s a very slow episode. The briefing scene seems interminable, so at least it’s a plausible recreation of a real meeting. And hilariously, as long as this scene is, it doesn’t have time for Kirk to explain his plan to kill lure the aliens into Romaine‘s body and kill them with pressure. As a result this just kind of happens when it happens and it’s absurd. How did he know pressure would kill then? How did he knows they would coalesce in Romaine’s body? Also I really like how the Enterprise crew now exterminates the last remnants of a near-extinct culture that is just desperately trying to survive without comment or discussion. It’s sad really. You can feel the production team no longer caring about the show.

I make my own fun by saying Tinkerbell’s invading when the lights enter the Enterprise.

Dull again, with a wet noodle finale. All buildup and no payoff. The library at Alexandra has been burned and no one cares. ”You‘ll have a lot of work rebuilding memory alpha from scratch Romaine, hahahaa.“ The Zetans were woefully undefined and they were killed in service of another romance that won’t ever be mentioned again. I mean I know that they were running out of money which is why we have all these long long scenes such as the chase with the Zetans and the briefing room so they can get lots of screen time out of limited resources, but that doesn’t explain why they aren’t putting more work into the dialogue to compensate. Good dialogue could be used to fill the holes I’m complaining about, and it WAS in the past in an episode such as Balance Of Terror. But now it feels like the show has become “well, here’s a rudimentary plot we came up with. See ya next week.” It’s being phoned in. The philsophical points and emotional impacts that used to be built into virtually every episode are becoming fewer and further between.

Don’t worry though. I’m reminded of Doctor Who again, which also experienced a period of sad decline under the 6th and 7th doctors before it was cancelled (go watch Delta And The Bannerman, I DARE you). But it too was eventually gloriously reborn so even though I’m feeling a bit glum about how TOS is ending up, I know there’s more positive material head which I’ll get to in time.",startrek,Kayfim20,False,/r/startrek/comments/hl1w4q/the_lights_of_zetar_first_time_viewing_reaction/

My introduction to ST was Voyager as a young teenager. Absolutely adored it, and still do. On the whole, I find the crew of the USS Voyager to be the most interesting ensemble yet put together. Tuvok (controversial I know) is my favourite Vulcan. Special shout outs to the Doctor, Neelix, Seven, Kim, Paris,  B'Elanna,  Chakotay...in fact the who darn crew was pretty special and varied. 

After Voyager I tried TNG and bounced hard off the first few seasons, the same with DS9 - although that show also improved dramatically as the series went on! 

I have also enjoyed DISCO, particularly Captain Pike and Saru stand out.  

All that to say, that the idea of Enterprise is really appealing, even though I don't usually enjoy prequels. The idea of the first starship leaving earth, figuring out starfleet protocols, first contact with other familiar races etc. all sounds very interesting.

I tried looking up what commercials played with TOS though DS9 but have only found random stuff. I was also looking for the station announcements for DS9.

38,The ending of the TNG episode “First Contact” is so depressing.,1593840015,"This episode is a fantastic episode in the way it’s written since it gives us a point of view outside of the Enterprise crew and a group of interesting characters from a world that is about to take its first step into a new age.

However much of the conflict in the episode revolves around the more idealistic and hopeful scientist against this arrogant adviser who’s complaint on everything is that “we’re moving too fast”. During much of the episode the scientist is working to get their warp drive operational and meets with the Enterprise crew while this adviser essentially goes out and tortures Riker doing everything he could to sabotage this first contact encounter out of what amounts to fear and espionage.

I will grant the possibility of an alien invasion after meeting an alien operative is *definitely* something to be a bit fearful about. Still his methods and his work throughout the episode make him a vile antagonist who eventually gets hurt trying to frame the Enterprise crew for murder because “we’re moving too fast”. Luckily the crew is able to save him and save face.

However what strikes me about the ending is that after all of this the man’s views are considered valid and actually taken in by the leader of their country/world. Now the overall metaphor of idealism versus conservatism is quite poignant throughout the episode, but I’d have to say the ending is anything but happy, idealistic or even optimistic. The conservative adviser is treated as if he has a fair point after essentially blaming innocent people for crimes because he was afraid of what the future would bring. Maybe it’s just the culture war in our country right now really getting to me, but this episode’s ending really grinds my gears. 

In our own history progress socially and economically has often been slowed by people like that adviser. Compromises are often made which lead to situations not really improving and ultimately growing anger because people are too afraid to grow and become better. In the end that adviser doesn’t grow or become better. He is absolved of everything because he’s friends with the president and his point is treated with great care. That president alters their entire optimistic future of friendship and cooperation with a friendly group of aliens all to appease a bunch of fearful idiots like that adviser. A bright future snuffed out because of a criminal shooting himself with a phaser.

Anyway, I put the last three seasons of TNG on shuffle the other day, and the Next Phase popped up. Its the episode where Geordi and Ro ""die"" in a transporter accident. Then just by luck, the next episode to pop up was Realm of Fear, in which Reginald Barclay sees the monsters in the transporter matter stream. 

In the latter, Reg, trying to calm his fear of transporters, asks Geordi if anything strange has happened to him in a transporter. To which Geordi answers, ""no not really."" Apparently Geordi's memorial service didn't make much of an impression that neither Reg or Geordi remembered it 3 episodes later. 🤣

Hence, ""The Undiscovered Country"" deeply resonated with me when it came out and was my long-time favourite Star Trek movie (later along with ""First Contact"").

Yesterday I watched it again after probably 25 years. Let's say, context seems to help, and cinema has changed. This movie got quite lengthy at times. Not the movie's fault, but a good reminder how our watching habits have changed, how things are so much faster these days. I also found that having the context of the movie only as a memory, but not as something you ""feel"" right now, somewhat weakens the impact. That desire, better: craving for a turn to a peaceful future is in my today's life not as strong anymore.

I still enjoyed the dinner scene, and how the Enterprise crew overcomes their own frosty distrust towards the Klingons and takes responsibility in order to save whatever can be saved in this attempt to forge a peaceful future.

61,Some Thoughts on Parallels,1593812900,"Great episode from season 7 TNG. The one where things keep changing around Worf and no one notices but him. It was on BBC America today and while watching it, I had some thoughts...

It was cool that they brought back Wesley in this episode (even though they brought him back again ""for real"" a few episodes later), but was Tasha Yar not checking her voicemails? Maybe it would have been too reminiscent of Yesterday's Enterprise but when I see this episode, it seems like kind of a big obvious oversight that none of the realities we saw had tasha still there as chief of security. 

At one point, Worf asks Captain Riker how long he's been captain, and Riker says essentially since Picard died during Best of Both Worlds. ""You don't remember any of this do you?"", ""I do remember, I just remember differently""... it's at this point where I have a vision of Worf actually saying, ""In my reality, you saved captain picard"". What a mind-kcuf that would be for captain Riker! You know he's probably been dwelling on those events for years, wondering if there was some way he could have saved Picard. Only to have Worf be like, ""yeah, you did in my reality, why didn't you here? Too busy showing some aliens the ""riker maneuver""? 

Later on, Captain Riker is talking to 'our' captain picard. He asks for the shuttle, gives an awkward ""good to see you again"". While they are having this conversation, Worf is standing behind them! So, what Worf is this? Is that just another Worf from another reality? Is he also shifting through time. Do all the worfs shift? What about the worfs where geordi doesn't have a visor? At one point, Troi says she doesn't think she'l ever get her worf back. Why not?

The BBCA episode ends with Worf asking Deanna to stay for dinner. Ho hum, that is what friendly colleagues do. The original episode continue with Worf confidentially  requesting Champagne from the replicator with Deanna looking on in surprise as she realizes this dinner might be going in a different direction. That ending is just lost in the rerun. 

I’ve seen that in other episodes, such as where Data is watching for a pot to boil with his internal chronicle set to off and then being surprised when it boiled as an end joke to the episode. In both instances those minor plot points were revisited in some way later on. I understand BBCA wanting to trim episodes for more commercials but at least TOS edits from the ‘60s for ‘70s reruns are simply mid episode small jokes that don’t have a major impact on the future plots.

But what saves the Enterprise at the end of the episode has bothered me for many years.

Later, after the Enterprise has “destroyed” the Hathaway, when Daimon Bractor is getting ready to fire on the Enterprise again, Worf plays his trick again and makes the Kreetcha’s sensors think another Federation starship is approaching.

Worf was only able to fool the Enterprise’s computer because he had the command codes, which Picard even mentioned during the war game and ordered the codes changed.  So the question is, are the Ferengi dumb enough to run around the galaxy with non-password-protected computers where the solution to any battle with a Ferengi marauder is just to make their sensors think a fleet of enemy starships is arriving so they’ll flee, or is Worf suddenly (and only in that one instance) a master-hacker who can defeat security codes in a matter of minutes?",startrek,RockTheGlobe,False,/r/startrek/comments/hkpkpv/the_plot_hole_in_tngs_peak_performance_has_bugged/

78,Long Time Star Trek Fan Finally Watches DS9: Season 7 episodes 2-4,1593783940,"Shadows and Symbols: it’s funny that the psychiatrist tells Sisko his words don’t mean anything to anyone, because the story of DS9 means a hell of a lot to me.

This was a better episode for me. I loved Kira kicking some romulan butt, I loved the Klingon space battle (and I don’t usually like space battles). And I kinda like Sisko’s plot here. We gotta free the hidden wormhole alien. And that old plotline from the episode where they did the commentary on race was kind of brilliant. He was never sure what happened to him in that episode, never really sure that the other reality wasn’t true. I love the symbolism of choosing not to erase this. 

Afterimage: oh watching Ezri and Bashir together hurt on so many levels. I wanted them to be together for the first two seasons so hearing her say that if Worf hadn’t showed up she would have fallen for Julian was a little painful. 

The first Ezri Garak scene was so awkward it was hard to watch. But the holosuite scene was much better. I loved how he trusted her. 

When Ben dismissed Ezri and she started crying outside his office, I wanted him to burst out the door and hold her and tell her he believes in her. But this show doesn’t work like that and I think that’s what makes these scenes so powerful. 

Worf when Miles shows up with alcohol: Oh no not again. That was magic. 

The rest was okay. I just kinda wanted Ezri to stop changing her mind. 

My thoughts on Garak’s claustrophobia are mixed. It feels weird that they come right out and say it over and over, because it’s a really odd character flaw for him to me. But he plays it really well and it’s an exciting plot device. 

Help me out real quick guys: is Kira a colonel because she is in the Bajoran militia and they follow army ranks? And Star Fleet follows navy, yes? It’s been awhile since I needed to know ranks in real life. You’d think I’d remember something I actually needed to know irl at some point but I don’t.

Take me Out to the Holosuite: since when is Nog a senior officer??  Also where is Jake? Jake showed up. Guys I hate baseball but I’m having a great time. We’ve got Worf, and a genetically enhanced doctor! For a second I forgot that they didn’t actually film this on a space station and went “Wow, what a realistic holo program.”

Death to the opposition! 

I loved every second of this. The symbolism, the messaging, the excitement. The celebration in Quark’s was amazing. I don’t love when they fight against Vulcan control over emotion in any Star Trek series because I think it’s different, not wrong.

But anyway.

Phew! What a relief! I’ve just had two episodes in a row which I was pretty snarky about, and I didn’t want to make it three. Though in the past I’ve had a good time mocking a bad episode (I remember my Omega Glory review gradually devolving into a stand up routine) I’m now coming near the end of TOS and from reading Shatner’s biography I know it was an unhappy time making these final episodes. I wasn’t taking pleasure in sinking the boot in and hoped this end run would have some goodies in it.

That Which Survives, while not a classic, is a good enough episode and certainly better than the last two. Granted it‘s also less ambitious, being much more standard in its premise and content, but maybe that lack of ambition made its goals more achievable for the production team.

My first surprise is that the guest geologist is a middle aged man, not a sexy young lady. I guess this means he dies. I turn out to be bang on the money here, unfortunately. Though it is a brief role, I like Batanides as D'Amato, he's very believable, down-to-earth. You could almost believe he was a series regular. Sulu's going too, yay! In fact this episode sees beefier roles for two of the crew, specifically Sulu and Scotty. It’s good to see an episode making better use of the supporting cast.

It’s hilarious that just when expect the away team to teleport out of the Enterprise, some woman teleports in. It’s also quite startling. I like this woman‘s eye makeup very much. Hmm, Lee Merriweather... the name rings a bell. Initially I think she was on Charlie’s Angels or something, but no, she’d be too old for that. Then Kirk throws his exploding phaser away and the immortal words “Some days you just can’t get rid of a bomb” echo through my mind. That’s it! She was Catwoman in the Batman movie! Now really, what is going on with the cast of Batman all turning up in Star Trek all of a sudden. Did they share producers or something? Merriweather’s acting is a bit off, but that’s OK because once we realise she’s a hologram projection of a computer mind, it’s credible that the awkwardness is intentional to reflect her inhuman nature.

Adam West would have made a good Vulcan. “Highly illogical old chum.”

The wobbly set as the away team arrive on the planet is so cute. As for the wobbly Enterprise, you’d think by now Starfleet would have invented shockwave compensators or seatbelts or something. But the bumping around does pave the way for the fantastic line ""The occipital area of my head seems to have impacted with the arm of the chair."" Which brings me to Spock being particularly deliciously dickish this episode. ""Please Mr Scott, restrain your leaps of illogic."" I'd like to clarify that although last episode I lamented that Shatner seems to have gotten worse at portraying Kirk over time, this phenomenon is confined to him. Everyone else is doing fine or has improved. (Shout out to Chekov who was the only crew member I disliked initially, but he pulled it together eventually.) Even though I kind of enjoy it, I find myself remarking several times upon what an ass Spock is this episode. It reminds me a lot of The Galileo Seven in which Spock was a jerk to make some point about luck or impulsiveness which I don’t remember too clearly, only this time Spock's shirtiness is to make a similar point about intuition as he ignores Scotty’s warnings that the ship doesn’t feel right, only for Scotty to later be validated.

Scotty: The ship feels wrong. It’s something I cannot put into words.

Spock: That is obvious Mr Scott.

Who pissed in Spock’s cornflakes this morning?

This exchange also cracks me up.

McCoy: I wonder what killed him.

Kirk: I don’t know, but someone or something... did.

A lot of episodes feature a planet side adventure and then cut away to dull filler scenes of people standing about on the Enterprise wondering what’s happening and being unable to help. This is solving that problem by giving both groups problems to deal with. It’s almost like two episodes in one. Yes it’s another super being story but she feels a little different and has a really unsettling teleport effect. That sound effect, brrr, chills every time.

The away team settles down for a rough night outdoors. In the original script, there was an amusing dialogue between Kirk and McCoy about who had to be the little spoon.

Great illustration of the Vulcan character that rather than doing the noble hero thing of insisting he undertake the suicide mission, Spock acknowledges that Scotty is a more logical choice and lets him take his place. Unfortunate however that it’s right about here that the episode takes a slight downturn with a bunch of technobabble in lieu of a clear plot. ”I’ve set charges to blow me clear of the ship if I rupture the magnetic bottle“ Scotty says. What? “REVERSE THE POLARITY“ I cry in reference to the old Doctor Who meme of the third doctor “reversing the polarity” any time he needed any machine to do anything unlikely. And my jaw is on the flaw when Scotty actually reverses the polarity. They heard me. It’s a striking coincidence. Spock babbling on about the impotence of gratitude as Scotty collapses is hilarious.

Now to tidy up our other plot, we cut to Kirk, McCoy and Sulu arriving at a high school disco. The action finale is pretty lame, particularly how some random nobody from nowhere saves the day by shooting the computer. Kirk and co should have outwitted it somehow. A sour note in an otherwise decent episode.

Beauty survives? What exactly is Kirk saying here? That Losira is a hottie? What on earth does that have to do with anything? How is that the line to close on?

Rather like The Mark Of Gideon, That Which Survives actually makes \*less\* sense the more attention you pay. The computers defence scheme is so bizarrely complicated it would take quite some time for me to simply describe it in a neutral, objective way, because it really is sort of mad. Why not just blow the Enterpise up? Surely Losira has the power to do this given everything else it does. Teleporting the Enterprise far away and then sending in some energy projection person to sabotage it doesn’t make a lot of sense. And I never really understood that thing about fixing the “incision” to bring the molecules of the ship back in phase with a magnetic probe. I’m not convinced the writer understood it either. And why not just zap the invaders on the planet with energy blasts instead of sending hard-light projection assassins keyed to individual DNA? Oh I know it’s because then we wouldn’t have an episode, but there should have been more in-story rationale.

So yeah, no masterpiece but I had fun with the enjoyably corny “ship is gonna blow” scenes and an intriguing mystery which despite its less than perfect resolution was still pleasantly diverting.

87,Why Starships always meeting head on makes sense,1593757665,"People always complain that the ships in Star Trekk always meet face to face, rather then at completely random orientations as you would expect if the ships were really traveling randomly around the galaxy doing their own thing.

But my problem with that reasoning is that ships arn't traveling randomly across the galaxy. The vast majority of travel will be between set, largely stationary objects. Namely planetary systems and space stations. And sure if you drew all the possible connections from every star to another there might be a lot of cross over. But that's not really how ships are traveling either. Most transport would be between the neighboring stars, and science craft on serves would move logically from one system to the next, not really skipping anything. So rather then a big 3d void space is like the highway system, just with roads able to move in 3d rather then 2d space.

As a west coast American the vast majority of land in my state is just empty fields. But I only ever see a thin stretch around I-9 or highway 2 becouse that's just how I get to the towns on the other side. Add to that the fact ships would have to orient themselves around any star bases for docking, and most races would probably have developed a concept of up and down for their home planet which can be transfered to other systems via the local sun's magnetic field and you have a good amount of ships wanting to be either ""right side up"" or ""upsidown"".

Add to that intergalactic standards and such (particularly within the Federation) and you have a largely standard ""up"" within a system, and people traveling on set paths encountering each other on set ""highways"" in space.

Sure, Alpha Centari's ""up"" may not be the same as Sol's, but at the very least 2 ships should approach eachother in interstellar space facing eachother, if at a bit of a wonk. The rest is either some sort of intergalactic courtesy/show of respect, or just wanting to be taken seriously. Like would a D'deridax warbird de-cloaking staring you down be half as intimidating if it was sideways? No, a federation crew would go ""what the heck are those Romulans doing on their side?""

So in the end should you expect ALL encounters in open space to be ""the right way up"" face-to-face? Probably not. But encounters in systems have better then 50/50 odds and you could expect the vast majority of encounters in interstellar space to be head on, with a good amount of ships ""correcting"" their relative orientation for either courtesy, honor, or intimidation.",startrek,Official_N_Squared,False,/r/startrek/comments/hke40g/why_starships_always_meeting_head_on_makes_sense/

93,Why did Kira save Dukat when she went back in time?,1593753798,"I just finished re-watching Wrongs Darker then Death or Night, where Kira goes back in time to learn about her mom.

In the end after she plants the bomb, she sees her mother crying over the video of her father and realizes she is doing what she is her family and doesn't deserve to die for it. Kira then rushes to get her mom out of the room. So far so good.

But then she runs into the other room where Dukat is, shouts that he has to leave. He is confused and hasn't responded to anything else in that conversation so far (like when Kira apparently tried to force his mistress to leave the room), so it seems he couldn't hear them. Kira then says theirs a bomb and they run out.

My question is, why did Kira spend extra time to go back and save Dukat's life? He's still basically Hitler to Kira and he has done nothing but get more evil in her eyes throughout the series. Killing Dukat in the past may not end the occupation, but it would prevent Cardassia from joining the Dominion, the fortification of their space, the subsequent mining of the wormhole, and the entire Dominion War. Not only that but instead of being part of the Dominion Cardassia would be run buy it's civilian government after their successful coup shortly before Dukat's direct actions leading to the dominion taking over. The same government which was in the process of creating peaceful coexistence with Bajor, soon to be a Federation member (or even currently one. Without the Dominion War there is no need for Bajor to ""stand alone""). Sure the Dominion would have their eyes on the quadrant, but it would be more stable and a much longer takeover process, giving the major powers time to ally and fortify.

Of course the real reason is because Dukat survived the occupation so the show couldn't kill him in the past. But is there any in-universe reason for Kira to go out of her way to save Dukat's life and single-handedly save the Alpha and Beta quadrants? (Well they win the war in the end so maybe not saved but you know.) Remember, Kira believes ""Nothing can happen without the Prophet's blessing"" when time traveling from the beginning of this episode. In other words if she tried to kill him and the Prophets wanted Dukat to live then he would, at least in her eyes.",startrek,Official_N_Squared,False,/r/startrek/comments/hkdcgs/why_did_kira_save_dukat_when_she_went_back_in_time/

On top of that, Anovos can't seem to keep a stable inventory, probably because their prices are so high that nobody can afford it!

What do the majority of Star Trek fans do? Is there one place where a bunch of people get their stuff, or are most folks making their uniforms?

7,Enterprise S3 – Why 'Strange New Worlds' Needs Specificity,1593733587,"Like many on this sub, I’m excited for Strange New Worlds. While I have enjoyed Picard and Disco, I’m ready for a change of a pace and a shift to a more exploratory/story of the week style of show. With one BUT.


Having recently rewatched Enterprise S3 I’ve realized…it’s the best ‘exploration’ mission we’ve ever had? 


The Expanse is probably the most we’ve ever gotten to know a ‘region’ of space, with its unique hazards, politics, species and development. The area develops its own distinct character, unique to any other stretch of the Alpha Quadrant – something that has never really been replicated. 


Further, the ship and crew feel the effects of a deep space mission in a way that TOS, TNG, and VOY weren’t able or interested in doing. While in Enterprise’s case, the Xindi Weapon and a ticking clock were the reason that the Enterprise couldn’t simply return to Earth when damaged for repairs - and the crew didn’t have an easy escape from the harsh conditions of their mission - the same conditions would apply during a five year, deep space mission away from the Federation. 


After all, the Captain can’t just turn around and run to spacedock when the going gets tough – they’re in deep, unexplored space.
I’m in no way advocating for a ‘big threat’ or a ticking clock like Enterprise. But Strange New Worlds could offer us the first attempt at a genuinely grueling deep space mission – and a form of serialization that doesn’t rely on a ‘Big Bad’ or an overarching plot.


In the era of bigger budget, prestige television, what does it mean to be away from Earth for five years? What does it mean to be exploring a new region of space for the first time? What is the Starfleet equivalent of the old exploration missions seeking the Northwest Passage or a voyage across the Atlantic?


I think that Strange New Worlds would benefit greatly from the sense that the crew really is out in deep space, that they will have wear and tear, complications and consequences as they explore, and that where they explore should have its own, defined character. That their exploration be given a sense of specificity. It could also be an effective mechanism to provide substantive definition to territories that already exist in canon have a unique flavor.

30,Long Time Star Trek Fan Finally Watches DS9: Season 6 finale and 7 intro,1593696447,"This is one of the more spoiler intensive posts if you have been watching along with me. I already knew what was going to happened but in case you don’t, watch the episodes first. 

Season Six Finale: hey guys, please don’t get mad. I didn’t like this episode. And not because of Jadzia. 

I don’t like the wraith plot line. It feels more supernatural than scifi. They sort of appeared out of nowhere in season six with no real explanation and suddenly there’s this ancient feud we’ve never heard about. The wormhole aliens are at least just that- aliens that live in the wormhole. These are evil things that somehow got trapped in rocks and statues for some reason, two of which have been freed now, and one of which turned off the orbs and also the wormhole which made the wormhole aliens not happy. What I love about science fiction is that it makes sense, and can be explained, within the context of the show or movie. There are exceptions to this as with everything (ex. The Expanse). But in this case, where DS9 has been incredible because of how it’s so well developed, it didn’t work for me.

Jadzia’s death was a little botched to me. It was pretty senseless. Now, I am very well aware of the reason she was killed/the actress left the show, and I totally respect it. That’s not what I mean by senseless. Jadzia spent her whole time on the show living with Klingons, going on Klingon missions, marrying one, and she turned around and was killed by some undefined mystic power. Where’s the honor? Where’s the sense of adventure that defined her character? How hard would it have been for her to be on the mission with Sisko, for something to go wrong there? Why couldn’t Worf have been there with her? 

It very much reminds me of Yar’s death in TNG. I was in a thread where someone called it senseless (or pointless, I can’t remember). She was killed by a big ball of tar because it was bored. It feels very similar except Yar’s death to me, was trying to send the message that all unnecessary death is senseless. That life isn’t a toy, that killing won’t solve your problems. Jadzia’s death was more about finding a random way to kill her off.

That said, I was crying hysterically anyway because I loved Jadzia, right up until Sisko made her death about him. He had no way of knowing Dukat was going to sneak onto the station possessed by a demon and kill her (probably because it was completely ridiculous). So he had nothing to do with that. And correct me if I’m wrong but the prophets didn’t tell him not to go on the mission, did they? They sent him a vague message. Which he interpreted as them telling him not to go so he could blame himself. His best friend just died and he was like, “I gotta get myself together.” Not the time, Sisko. It was so heartfelt for about three seconds as he talks about the difference between best friends and mentors (some of my mentors overtime have become my best friends, the people who watched me grow up- more crying). But then he just killed it trying to ask her memory to sort out his problems for him. My personal statements to Sisko: Dude you can figure it out on your own. You’ve only been the emissary for six years? You’re the only one who can talk to the prophets. This is YOUR problem. The symbolism behind taking his baseball home was clever to me, though.

On a completely unrelated note, I’m not seeing the character changes in Dukat that you guys didn’t like. He’s power hungry, we know he’s crazy, and he grasping at straws to get his prestige back. That’s all in character for me. He’s also just going ahead and doing whatever the heck he wants, which is also in character to me. He’s desperate, which is entertaining. But then he got possessed by a wraith and you already know what I think about that.

Season 7 Intro: Image in the Sand: This was better. Sisko’s plotline was still a 2 or a 3 out of 10 for me. Julian, Worf, and Miles were about a 7-8 and Kira’s was a 9-10. 

We’ll start with Kira. First off, I love the hair. But I love how she runs the station. She is still looking out for Bajoran best interests, but she recognizes that most of the station is still run by Federation officers and acknowledges that as an authority. She and Odo are a good team. I’m excited about this plotline of Romulan interference and armament encouraged by the Federation because Kira is going to take zero of this crap. 

For Julian, Worf, and Miles: this is more fitting for a funeral for Jadzia to me. I expected her death to be more honorable so I’m glad they’re acknowledging her Klingon ties. I’m also glad they are showing Worf’s grief because her death was more about Sisko than her. Worf, Julian, and Miles are making it about her. It feels like a better way to start ending Jadzia’s plotline. 

And uh... Sisko’s. I’ll come right out and say it. I’m still not interested in the Bajoran Wraith cult. We’ve gone down some rabbit whole here that I suspect we don’t recover from. It’s not mysterious to me, it’s just weird, in a not great way. Like a really uncomfortable way. But uh... I guess we’re doing this. That’s all I’ve got. I’m nervous I won’t like Ezri but I started the next episode and I honestly kind of love her already. And to end on a positive Sisko note, I love how easily he adapts to new Daxs. She’s still Dax. She still has Curzon. But we’ll talk about that more in the next blog!",startrek,MrPotato2753,False,/r/startrek/comments/hjwzjv/long_time_star_trek_fan_finally_watches_ds9/
31,“The Mark Of Gideon” - First Time Viewing Reaction,1593694605,"Noob Trek 71 - The Mark Of Gideon

In which Kirk actually advertises the Federation‘s sex education programme.

I’m now feeling pretty silly about what I wrote at the beginning of my entry on The Empath, specifically that Season 3 wasn’t that bad. I’m now getting cold feet about the wisdom of that pronouncement, and am thinking it May have been foolish to suggest that fan consensus about Season 3 isn’t based on something substantial. It seems the wheels really are coming off; I can feel the show starting to struggle over the last few instalments. This was better than the dreadful Let That Be Your Last Battlefield, but still had problems in many areas: tedium, incoherence, uninspired acting. Like LTBYLB this is frustrating and sad because it didn’t need to be that way. There’s some clever and unique ideas hiding inside The Mark Of Gideon, they just don’t get to emerge and develop fully.

I liked the opening, with Kirk eerily alone on an empty starship. A transporter mishap? Or has he entered some parallel dimension? Or did everyone else? Or is Gideon up to some trick? It’s a good thing I liked the opening because it’s followed by near 25 minutes of dross. While there are some bright spots in this stretch, the first half of this episode really made it hard to keep my eyes open. (Fortunately things pick up in the second half when some stuff happens and we get a glimpse at the interesting concepts the entire episode should have focused on.) 

Example of a bright spot: “The purpose of diplomacy is to prolong a crisis.” Brilliant. Interesting to see Spock uncharacteristically bristle against protocol, I guess the loss of Kirk rattles even him.

But as to the myriad reasons why I found the first half of this episode a slog, Shatner's reading his lines badly. Now I know Season 3 is reputed to be crap because of budget cuts but budget cuts don’t explain the dawning realisation that Shatner has, against expectations, gotten \*worse\* at playing Kirk as time goes on. In his biography he mentions accusations that he got hammy and overacted at the end, but denies them, saying he doesn’t see it. With no explanation from him, why his performance deteriorated is a bit of a mystery. Are there any fan theories? I know from reading his book that three years was the longest he’d ever been in one gig as he was used to hopping from play to show to film in his early acting career. Maybe he wasn't used to sustaining interest in one role for so long and it got stale for him? Just listen to him toss of silly lines like “I don’t know, I’m not familiar with that quadrant.” Like he casually recognises a quadrant of space by glancing out a window as one of the quadrants of space he doesn’t know very well. Shatner seems bored, lifeless, the old spark is gone.

The introduction of Odona is disappointing. I was hoping we were on some Langoliers shit. This is not the first time I’ve been excited about Trek going in a horror direction which it then steadfastly doesn’t, so maybe that false expectation leading to disappointment is an issue I have as a horror junkie and not something to blame the show for. But all the same, the silent eerie ship was an empty canvas for something really unusual and instead we get random space babe of the week again. Acker’s amateurish acting doesn’t help.

I start to fear that this is the second boring as hell episode in a row. I am mildly diverted by legendary bassist Tony Levin appearing as Hodin’s advisor Krodor.

Spock and Hodin‘s verbal handbag duel goes on forever. Once again I feel my time is being wasted. Listening to Hodin this episode should have been called The Snark Of Gideon.  This isn’t gelling, nothing’s going on. No sense of urgency, everyone‘s just hanging around, Kirk’s sudden transition to seducing Odona is silly.

(Now I’m aware that subsequent revelations in the latter part of the episode reveal more was going on than I thought, particularly with regard to the characters of Hodin and Odona. You might argue that I wouldn’t write what I did if I’d known what I know now, but the thing about twist plots is that the stuff before the twist has to be \*entertaining in its own right\*. The Usual Suspects was engaging before the surprise end. That’s why even though some of the cool ideas at the end improve the episode as a whole, they don’t change the fact that I was despairing for most of the first half.)

This dialogue is so unnatural, no one’s focussed on what they should be. And then Kirk suddenly flies into a murderous rage which is quite uncomfortable, and we cut to Hodin looking at Odona and Kirk get intimate on a screen. I guess Hodin likes to watch. This is so odd. It’s a stark contrast with Let That Be Your Last Battlefield, because in that episode it was at least clear to me what they were trying to do.

OH MY GOD when the green faces suddenly appear when Kirk and Odona kiss, I’m laughing my ass off. But at least something happened. Amusing as I found it, it’s scary too. And I admit when Kirk opened the viewport I was a little freaked. Suddenly I shift from drooping over in defeat, near face down in my Swiss Miss, to being on the edge of my seat. Now we’re getting somewhere.

(However once the twist is revealed, one wonders who designed the replica such that you could see the populace outside. ”Kirk needs to be convinced that he’s on a duplicate enterprise in space. Also, make the ship windows look out onto public thoroughfares where he can see our population just walking around everywhere.”)

And finally the big reveal, it’s the Truman Show. I have to pause the video and think and I admit that this is kind of clever. In this sci-fi setting I expected the alternate Enterprise to be some parallel/pocket dimension nonsense, so I didn’t see the replica story coming. Yet shower thoughts erode my initial impressions of the twist. I still don’t really understand why they needed the replica or Odona. Just beam Kirk down, take his blood, inject it in people, done. Oh I know they say they needed Odona to make Kirk want to stay but then she‘s about to die so how would that work? And why exactly did she need to seduce him in a replica of the Enterprise? How did they know to make a perfect replica of the Enterprise? They even copied the objects in Kirk’s quarters? How did they get access to Kirk’s medical records?

Hodin’s like “This used to be a paradise Kirk, wide open fields, space enough for all everywhere. But then I got really into model building and made a full scale half a mile long model of the enterprise right in the middle of town and it’s really fucked pedestrian traffic flow up.”

And why did all the population suddenly press their chests against the replica Enterprise briefly for the thousand heart beats sound effect? AND WHY THE HELL DOES KIRK KNOW WHAT THAT SOUNDS LIKE?

Soon we are treated to Kirk saying “Hey why don’t we just sterilise everyone” and about to ask Scotty to airdrop the Enterprise’s shipment of condoms onto the planet.

Holdin is a complex character. Initially he’s just an annoying bureaucrat, then appears to be a scheming villain, then turns out to be more nuanced than that. Unfortunately his character struggles to emerge clearly through all the vagaries of the plot and the infuriatingly fuzzy dialogue he has with Kirk. This dialogue scene tantalisingly offers hope that everything we’ve just sat through is about to be explained and justified and offer redemption, but it doesn’t quite get there and I still had questions and confusion aplenty. We respect and love life so much, and taking it or shortening us is such anathema to us, that we’ve all agreed to make everyone die younger by deliberately allowing a pandemic? No sale.

These leads us into a really strange sitcomesque ending which seems absolutely tone deaf. Kirk and Odona are enjoying a laugh together, her father’s schemes and her entrapment of him forgotten, as he smileingly sends her off to the miserable hell planet to give everyone a fatal disease. There seems to be no consequences for Holdin, and no appreciation of the gravity of the situation or a less batshit way of handling it.

I could keep going - I’ve thought of more plot holes and problems with this episode, but I don’t want to. Fatigue is setting in. Don’t worry I’m definitely continuing with my marathon, I just don’t want to talk about Mark Of Gideon anymore. It’s funny, when I first saw it, I was buoyed by all the interesting possibilities of the second half after the tedious first act, but the more I think about it, the more flawed it seems and it just leaves me feeling deflated.

45,A really fun continuity detail I just noticed from TNG to DS9,1593661749,"I've watched DS9 a couple of times all the way through, but I have to admit that I had never seen TNG up until now.

My wife and I are halfway through Season 7 of TNG (first time for both of us) and halfway through Season 2 of DS9 (First time for her, third or fourth time for me)

We just watched the TNG episode ""Parallels"" - where Worf goes dimension-hopping.  Absolutely fantastic episode, easily best of the season so far and probably top 5 for the show so far.

But there's one moment when he dimension shifts to find himself at the tactical station in the middle of a battle, and when he looks down at his control panel, he doesn't know how to turn the shields on because the new universe has a completely different control panel layout than he is used to.  They get hit by a torpedo, and Geordi dies.

Which immediately brought to mind a scene I somehow still remember from my last DS9 rewatch several years ago.

Season 4, Episode 7 - The Defiant is badly damaged by Jem'hadar ships and they've taken refuge in a gas giant.  Sisko is wounded, and Worf is in command of the ship down in engineering.  He asks some of O'Brien's engineers to rig up a control panel to display tactical information - so that he can control the ship from engineering.

The engineer gives him a control panel, but the configuration is all wrong, and Worf absolutely reams him out on it, saying that if it isn't set up exactly the way he is used to, he won't be able to effectively control the ship.

Back then, I just thought it was Worf being stubborn (he was - and it's actually a plot point for the episode), but now after watching Parallels, I realize that it was also a callback to this TNG episode, where Worf couldn't do his job because he the control panel was too different from what he was used to and people died because of it.",startrek,not-working-at-work,False,/r/startrek/comments/hjps5y/a_really_fun_continuity_detail_i_just_noticed/

79,Long Time Star Trek Fan Finally Watches DS9: Season 6 episodes 20-25,1593611691,"His Way: Yes, I am cheering, out loud, alone in my room. Do I even need to say anything else? The only other comment I had on this episode was that this feels like a TNG episode. It felt like one of Riker’s programs, the whole sentient hologram felt like one of their plots. The happy ending felt very out of character for DS9 but I’m so thrilled I honestly might cry. The way they were yelling at each other right until he kissed her was just amazing. Of course I watched that scene three times. I try not to root for relationships on these shows but Odo deserves to be happy, finally. 

The Reckoning: I love what they’re doing with Dax in this season. It’s a slab of stone with some words on it. She’s amazing. 

All in all, not my favourite Bajoran episode. It was just weird in a way that wasn’t even Star Trek weird. I think it was an important character moment for Winn. But honestly that’s most of what I got out of it. The whole energy battle thing was really weird. Why didn’t Sisko want to flood the station with chronitons? The Wormhole aliens didn’t tell him NOT to do it. They asked for his help and he freed the stone thing and that was what he was supposed to do. I just felt like we had this big weird episode that’s going more spiritual/supernatural than scifi just so Winn could be a jerk and ruin everybody’s prosperity to remain in power. 

Valiant: Nog wants us to decide for ourselves. I’ve decided- red squad captain was a bad captain AND they were a bad crew. The one girl knew he was addicted to drugs and didn’t relieve him of duty. Then he was punishing people for being emotional after they were far from home and all the experienced officers they were working with died. I mean really he punished Jake for that but that’s not better. And then Jake, somebody who has been in more combat situations than the entire crew combined, was thrown in jail because he didn’t agree with the captain and pointed out that the captain was on drugs, to someone who didn’t even believe him!

They made a mistake on this episode, in my opinion. In theory, Star Fleet academy age is what, 18? For humans at least? And by the time they made it this far, you imagine they’re closer to graduation than to freshmen. I don’t know the training process so correct me if I’m wrong, but these people look young. Like, 15-18 instead of 18-22. It felt like I was watching kids play soldier and not actual future soldiers getting promoted quickly. And I don’t think that’s a fair representation of current students in military academies or in colleges in general. That said, the overconfident drug addicted captain is an interesting metaphor. 

Profit and Lace: guys these Ferengi episodes have gone a little off the rails. That said, I didn’t mind it. Personally I’m not terribly invested in who the grand nagus is. I don’t really care if Brunt takes over. I don’t really care about their social reform because it’s taken them six seasons to get to the point. I mean I guess late is better than never but... when you watch an episode like this without being invested in the success of either side, it becomes more about laughing at Quark’s expense. It’s fine and all, but it’s not thrilling. It doesn’t give the same sense of adventure that the rest of the show brings. 

I like that we’ve seen more of the whole team interacting in these episodes (except Sisko). The main ops crew (except Sisko) were doing things like hanging out in the holosuite, helping with engineering stuff, problem solving. And as I used to say a lot, I love watching that. It’s exciting to me. That’s the way I want to work when I’m an actual adult. 

Time’s Orphan: as somebody pointed out yesterday, DS9 is a little reckless with time travel. There was definitely a lot of loose ends here. How did they not know about a time portal in the place they’ve been vacationing for years? How is Miles able to turn it on so easily? Seriously why couldn’t they compromise with the holosuite issue? Aren’t there other holosuites? It was a cute thought, and I appreciate Keiko’s moral decisiveness (we can’t take those years away from her), but I think we’re missing some explanations. We’re up to what... 3 torture Miles episodes in this one season?

This show also seems to take the stance that, for better or worse, the version of reality we’re faced with is the one we should keep. They associate never existing in the first place with death. I’m not sure that’s fair but I’m not sure it isn’t. But they have taken a consistent stance on it. Thoughts anyone?

The Sound of Her Voice: I thought this episode was kind of beautiful. It was super revealing about each of the characters, especially Julian, Sisko and Miles. The way Miles kept her audio on before they could talk to her was incredibly poetic, and said a lot about what motivates him. He felt like she was asking him specifically for help. As if to say when someone reaches out for anyone, everyone is responsible. 

Julian’s arrogance was obviously very pronounced. But his ability to shift gears and give care was also emphasized. I feel like Julian as a character could have grown a little more in this series in general. But I like his ability to flip flop around and transition into what he needs to be. He’s a good researcher, a good doctor, a good soldier, and a good friend, but pretty much never at the same time.

And obviously we tackled Sisko’s fear of commitment to his new relationship. I am personally less invested in his relationship because I don’t love Kassidy but I’m glad he’s working through that.

I think Miles is the one who really shined in this episode. I loved it because hardly anything happened, but a lot was said. A lot was risked for a single life. Especially as they got to know her, she was valued. And I find it very poetic the way they went about that. The fact that it was Miles’ version of a funeral shows the way that he connected to her differently. He is really defining what it means to be a good man to me.

Next blog is going to be season six finale and seven intro but it probably won’t be for a day or two. This is all stuff I wrote yesterday. I had a medical issue this morning, so I couldn’t study or watch ST and it’s going to be a long day at work. But I’m okay, and I’ll get those two watched ASAP!

Also not to be sappy but I just want you guys to know how much I appreciated all of the discussions yesterday. I came home from work and got to learn so much from your perspectives. My friends don’t like talking about these shows but I value them so much, and I’m really glad I found a community in you guys.

82,“Let That Be Your Last Battlefield” - First Time Viewing Reaction,1593606300,"Noob Trek 70 - Let That Be Your Last Battlefield

Note: I have just read the portion of Shatner’s biography which covers Star Trek. I learned very little as he gives it short shrift but he explains that book (Up Till Now) is his story, not the story of Star Trek and that for those who are interested, he has already written an entire book of Trek related anecdotes and gossip called Star Trek ~~Memery~~ Memories. Has anyone read this? Is it any good?

And it’s relevant that I read that, because Shatner actually craps on Season 3 of TOS. He says the joy of being renewed for a third season when they were on the executioner‘s block slowly turned to ashes in their mouths once the impact of the dramatic budget cut they received was apparent. As a result, a number of the episodes in season 3 are embarrassing by Shatner’s reckoning and tarnished the reputation of the show.

What a coincidence because ding ding ding! We have a winner! Worst. Episode. Ever. I have never been this unhappy watching Star Trek before. Episodes such as The Omega Glory and The Alternative Factor may have been more of a shambles but at least for those I sat wide eyed in fascinated disbelief at what I was seeing. This was just dull, dull, dull, deadly deathly dull. And it‘s so frustrating because it has an interesting opening, and there’s a fantastically profound and horrific point to be made with this plot, particularly its conclusion, but the execution is so bad I just could not give a shit. A real struggle to sit through.

The opening is good. I was pleased to see our old friend the little takeaway box ship again, and Lokai gave me quite a fright when he popped into frame. I was subsequently rather distracted by his make up which really made me wrack my brain. There’s an old DC or Marvel comics villain who looks exactly like this and I cannot remember their name. I thought it was Eclipse but that’s wrong. No, not Two Face, the guy I’m thinking of had his face split into black and white just like this. Any help? (Never mind, I might have solved it myself by looking at my comics database after the episode finished. I was probably thinking of Malekith, but his face is blue and black, not white and black. Was there another comics character whose face was white and black?) But back to the episode, it’s a good makeup concept, and it made me curious about Lokai.

Soon after Kirk refers to the southern part of the galaxy. This bugs me because galaxies don’t have “southern parts”. Once Bele turns up I click - oh, they’re trying to refer to the South of the USA, this is about the Civil Rights movement! And this far in I was going with it. I remember how electrifying the audacity of Patterns Of Force was when I realised what that story was trying to do, but Patterns of Force referred to events a quarter of a century past. This episode must’ve gone into production mere months after the death of Dr King. It takes a special kind of bad direction to drain all the interest and drama out of such a raw context and concept and make it as boring and tedious as this. I MEAN HOW DO YOU MAKE AN EPISODE WITH FRANK GORSHIN IN IT THIS BORING. You know, I’ve delighted in kicking some crappy episodes like For The Earth Is Hollow etc. around before, but I take no joy in disliking this. This should have been good. I was in despair asmy initial excitement at what this episode was, slowly frittered away until I just wanted it to stop.

So I’m sitting there, noting the nice continuity with The Enterprise Incident, as Kirk questions whether the invisible craft is Romulan given their possession of stealth technology. And I’m sitting there thinking that Spock must’ve told us a million times that his sensors are not malfunctioning. Just once I’d like him to go “Sensor readings indicate that the key component in the alien vessel‘s composition is... LOVE? ALRIGHT, WHO’S BEEN SCREWING WITH THIS THING? SULU?” Haha. Good times. And I’m sitting there. And I’m sitting there... Hmm this invisible spaceship thing is kind of boring, they’re just looking at an empty screen and stalling while nothing happens.

Little did I realise the rest of the episode was to be like this

So Bele and Lokai meet and I initially assume they’re actually the same being and I think that this better not be the the plot of The Alternative Factor again. But from here on the episode just annoys me over and over to the point that reading this review is probably hard going, so apologies and it’s understood if you don’t. I know who Gorshin is, but I’m sorry, he’s bad here. He’s either droning or over-acting, and Antonio, who I’m not familiar with is even worse with his whining, amateurish tones. The dialogue is clunky and repetitive and the writer seems to periodically forget that Kirk is present. And man oh man can that zooming in and out on the red alert fuck off.

Because what is with the camera work in this episode. That self destruct sequence is soul crushingly bad, my spirit just about left my body during it, it goes on FOREVER, and it’s underlined by these ludicrous extreme closeups that come out of nowhere stylistically and are just so weird and awful. I imagine someone had recently seen a few Leone films. There’s no suspense as we know Kirk isn’t going to blow up the ship. One of the rules of screenwriting is never base your plot on stakes the audience knows you won’t follow through with. This whole segment of the episode is literally wasting time. Odd camera choices continue throughout, such as the slow tracking shot across the crew as they calmly stand by and impassively watch Bele destroy the ships computer. We also get to see the Enterprise lovingly disinfect the planet for no goddamn reason at all.

But back to the plot, Bele has been chasing Lokai for 50,000 years? 50,000 YEARS? It’s absurd and such a ridiculous flourish smacks of a slapdash approach to the script. But the inconsistencies continue. If Bele can control the ship, why can’t he deactivate the self destruct? Why not use his powers on the crew? But later on Bele does want the ship destroyed? Why did he return the ship to Kirk’s control the second time? Why do they turn pink when they fight? Swift told this story better and in a fraction of the time with the war of the eggs from Gulliver’s Travels.

Shatner’s off the boil this episode too. His speech to Bele is ineffectually delivered and he keeps making bowling motions. The half-assedness continues as the ship’s commanding officers sit on their keisters doing nothing as two lunatics run around the ship and use a transporter with no security. That chase sequence is just the worst, two tired, clownish men doing a ridiculous cartoon run and looking like they’ve totally checked out of the production.

This is some of the slowest TV I’ve ever seen. Look at the way Shatner doesn’t even give a shit as he closes the episode. “Whatever, maybe they’ll die or kill each other or something, warp factor 2 Mr Sulu.“ I don’t blame him.

There’s a huge dramatic weight required for this subject matter, and a great care requires in the performance and writing of it. And boy is it not there. What a gulf between intentions and result. Questioning the necessity of the violent methods of the oppressed used to resist the oppressor, and challenging the judgemental, close-minded black-and-white (aha) thinking which leads to the continuation of that oppression, and foretelling what will become of us if that mutual hate continues to hold sway? Bold, vital stuff, in 1969 or 2020. But I’m sorry, theatrically this misfires on all kinds of levels. It is poorly made and unengaging. If it got people to think when it was transmitted, then that’s fantastic, as that is infinitely more important than my rankings about how entertained I wasn’t.

83,Why Badda Bing Badda Bang is an underrated episode.,1593592758,"I recently watched this episode, and it got me thinking- it represents a lot about what I love about DS9, and has a lot do with one scene that I think is VERY relevant today. 

But before I get to that I just want to add that I really loved Vic’s in general and that they did a “casino heist” episode in particular. It was both a great team building exercise for the senior staff as well as a distraction from the fatigue and trauma of the war. 

Anyways, the scene in question is when Sisko explains to Cassidy why he never goes to Vic’s. 

He explains that is glamorizes a time in Vegas that may have been memorable for some but was painfully exclusionary and racist to others. Cassidy acknowledges Ben’s concern, agrees with his concern, and adds her interpretation- that it represents how the past SHOULD have been. 

There are so many things I love about this one scene. 

First- as a white guy who was never around back then and who may have bought into this illusion- I REALLY appreciated that perspective.  The way Avery Brooks shaped his character and discussed his characters race created some of the finest moments in the franchise- if not in all of Sci-fi. And this was one of them. 

Second and perhaps most importantly, this was an amazing example back in the 90s on how you provide context for glorifying a problematic past. 

Furthermore, his concerns were heard- not just by Cassidy but the audience, and Cassidy’s response allowed the audience to appreciate Vic’s again within the context that it was an aspirational view of the past and NOT a completely accurate one. 

To drive this point even harder- it was Ben who was the “High Roller” (which as he explained would not have been allowed) and it was Cassidy who went to the cop for help (and he did) - a far cry from the more accurate depiction of police in Far Beyond The Stars. 

In a time where I think we are rightfully and 100% justifiably more sensitive in how we think about our past- especially in tv and movies, it’s great to be able to once again look back and see how ahead of the times Star Trek was.",startrek,stos313,False,/r/startrek/comments/hj6g4v/why_badda_bing_badda_bang_is_an_underrated_episode/

To counter this fleet, star fleet sends 200 of the 'federations best'. It takes 200 of their best ships to take on 200 romulan scraps?

Put this into contrast of a fairly early point of DS9 where the klingons attack the station. The station fights off 150 klingon ships by itself but begins succumbing to them. The klingons tuck their tails and run and the thought of 5 starfleet ships appearing.

My argument is that if every Vedek did it, the Cardassians would have killed off the Resistance in a few months. They just had to go to the Vedeks, threaten a few villages and obtain the location of every resistance cell. The Cardassian occupation would have lasted much longer, and thus cause much more deaths.  


Kai Opaka didn't realize that a guerrilla is inherently going to harm civilians, being it by actively killing them during attacks, or putting them at risk of the occupiers' retailations. If you don't accept that, there is no Resistance. If you give up as soon as civilian lives are at risk, just don't resist the occupation.  


Yes, the Vedek/Kai efforts had several times avoided further suffering to the civilians (like later Kai Wynn said), and that's fine, but actively pointing out resistance units for elimination under Cardassian threat is extremely wrong.

51,"""Yesterday's Enterprise"" - What am I missing?",1593482069,"I am a Star Trek newbie who has been watching the entire franchise in release order since January. Finally up to season 3 of TNG and at the end of today's 7-episode binge I come to ""Yesterday's Enterprise."" Leading up, I read nothing but praise for this episode. Some called it the ""City on The Edge Of Forever"" of TNG (my favorite TOS episode). Well, I just watched it, and I have to admit there was almost nothing I liked about it. 

1) If everything takes place on an alternative timeline and has no effect on the real continuity of TNG, who cares? Why is the outcome of a war happening in an alternate reality of interest if the ""real"" Enterprise doesn't get involved? The stakes are not real.

2) Alternate timelines are not interesting in storytelling unless they are manual. In the X-Men films, an alternate timeline is manually created by changing the past to save the future, something which Star Trek has skillfully and rightfully shyed away from because of the prime detective. Still, in the X-Men films, it makes sense because it's the ""new"" reality, and not an alternate one. Here, I didn't care. If there is at least one alternate timeline, by default, than can be many others, allowing any and all variables of the series canon continuity to be changed. To me, this fundamentally goes against what makes Star Trek interesting - the rules. Sci-Fi without rules in the writing is just magic, which is not as interesting because it leaves no room for surprises. 

3) The romance between Yar and Castillo - What was it based on? I couldn't think of any connection they had. 

4) Emotional closure for Yar was extremely unnecesary. Yar's ""empty death"" and the lack of meaning it had not only made it more realistic, but it made you appreciate it her more. The viewer was supposed to feel angry that her death was pointless and without redemption and that was the point. I find it comparable to Frank Sheeran's character arc in The Irishman (2019). Why was it necessary for the show to give closure to something that didn't need it and essentially retcon one of the first season's most ballsy moves? Who does this benefit?

61,"Why ""Death Wish"" is the greatest courtroom drama in Star Trek",1593475710,"""Death Wish"" is one of my favorite Voyager episodes and Star Trek episodes I general. I recently rewatched it again, and I was reminded of its brilliance. I want to share with you today why I consider it to be the best courtroom drama in Star Trek...

**It has a fascinating premise** - I mean, come on! An omnipotent immortal being is asking for asylum from mere mortals so that he can commit suicide in peace because his race won't allow it? That's just amazing. It immediately becomes apparent how deep of a problem this is, and it just invites so much discussion and thought. The very start of the episode is fascinating, as Q and Quinn play a game of cat and mouse across space and time with Voyager in the middle of it. This immediately gets you entertained and hooked, and you want to see what will happen next. That's exactly how Roddenberry described what a Star Trek episode should be.

**It addresses many different philosophical issues** - it starts off as a question of whether or not aiding a suicide is ethical, and then it quickly broadens the question and examines such issues as the meaning of life, the nature of existence, individual rights, social order, interference in other societies, and ultimately, freedom itself. This is done in a completely natural, logical way, as the arguments between Q and Tuvok play out in the courtroom under Janeway's guidance. We even get a fascinating glimpse into the Q Continuum, albeit filtered by Q and Quinn so that it can be understood by mortal beings. The episode also sheds light on Q's erratic behavior in TNG.

**It features stellar chemistry between characters** - over the course of Voyager's run, Tuvok often takes the role of an investigator or prosecutor. This time, he takes the role of defense counsel, and he was practically born for it. His interactions with Quinn are brilliant, and so is his conflict with Q. Our omnipotent trickster is his brilliant self as always, and he serves as a brilliant counterpart for Tuvok. On the other hand, the chemistry between Janeway and Q is something else. Initially rudely dismissing her a ""female"" captain, Q grows to appreciate and even actually adore Janeway. She begins to fascinate him as much as Picard did, because of her unwavering idealism, authority, and presence. The four characters primarily involved in the story, Janeway, Tuvok, Q, and Quinn are all given extremely meaningful moments, and even funny moments, but these are integrated well and they don't detract from the drama.

**It ties into Voyager's general narrative** - in this episode, Janeway is once again offered an easy way home which would however require her to do something that's wrong. The Continuum offers to return Voyager to Earth in the blink of an eye is she rules in their favor. This is what Voyager is about. This entire show is defined by the crew's persistent refusal to take the easy way out. Janeway's decision to save the Ocampa instead or running away and betraying her principles is what stranded Voyager in the Delta Quadrant in the first place. That decision would continue to haunt her for the rest of the show. By integrating itself into this continuing narrative, Death Wish makes itself even more meaningful and powerful.

**It has enduring consequences for the characters** - Q warns that if Janeway allows Quinn to commit suicide, disastrous consequences may follow. As the episode progresses however, Tuvok and Quinn convince both Janeway AND Q that individual freedom is more important than the will of the state. Janeway makes an extremely tough decision and a decides to grant Quinn asylum. She tries to persuade him to reconsider, but unfortunately, Quinn commits suicide anyway by taking a poison which he couldn't have possibly acquired on Voyager. And then it turns out that Q HIMSELF gave him the poison. That little twist at the end signals a major turn in Q's character. He is meaningfully developed here by in his interactions with our heroes, just like he slowly developed in TNG. He takes up Quinn's cause and vows to fight for liberty. Some time later, a shocking fact is revealed - Janeway is faced with the realization that her decision sparked a devastating war in the Continuum, just as Q said it might, which is threatening to destroy the galaxy and possibly more. That development makes her decision here feel really meaningful.",startrek,persistentInquiry,False,/r/startrek/comments/hic5u9/why_death_wish_is_the_greatest_courtroom_drama_in/

73,Long Time Star Trek Fan Finally Watches DS9: Season 6 episode 17-19,1593465763,"Wrongs Darker than Death or Night: Kira had no right to decide to kill her mother, so I’m glad she decided not to in the end. Sisko was asking why she didn’t though and I don’t like her reason. It’s not fair for her to just say, “She’s my mom.” Kira wasn’t supposed to be there, it wasn’t supposed to be her choice to make!

I was talking about this in the comments yesterday but I think Kira’s stance on collaborators is interesting. My personal opinion is that she is a little too aggressive with it, but she represents a very valid viewpoint. I don’t think it’s fair to hold civilians accountable for non-violent actions they take to protect themselves or their families in times of conflict. I certainly don’t think that a choice to not actively resist oppression makes you guilty of anything. I don’t think complacency is necessarily the wrong decision. I don’t think Odo was wrong for suggesting that Kira wait for Star Fleet to intervene in the Dominion occupation (I also don’t think Kira was wrong for going in a different direction). I just don’t think that choosing not to resist is something that should be punished the way she does. That said, there are modern applications where I’d waiver on that, especially right now. Complacency spread disease and micro aggressions against POC. Both of these conflicts could have ended peacefully a long time ago if we had punished complacency but who has the authority to do that? What punishment could inaction possibly incur? Kira condemns her own mother for doing what Dukat would have either forced her to do anyway or she would have been punished for resisting. There’s a reason Kira’s mom was not the first person they had seen Dukat do this to. 

And yes I’m aware that saying “Kira’s mom” doesn’t work because Kira is the family name but you guys know who I mean.

Inquisition: I don’t think any of the decisions Sisko and the investigator call “questionable” were actually questionable. Okay, MAYBE Julian should have been more focused on escaping than curing the addiction. But curing the addiction in itself was not a bad decision. Those Jem’Hadar suffered and died. I don’t care who the enemy is. If we can avoid that, we should. And when he suggested surrender, he did because hundreds of billions of lives are going to be lost. To know that, and to know that it can be avoided, is a perfectly valid reason to suggest it, even if it isn’t the right option. He had a responsibility to report his findings. 

Okay he did lie about the genetic engineering. I’ll give them that. But he is a good officer and he regrets it. He regrets it ever happened in the first place. 

Weyoun’s simulated lies are so despicable because it’s just almost believable. Because it very much sounds like something Julian would almost do. He would fight with himself about it but I personally think he would always choose Star Fleet. But if offered the chance in that context I think he would 

Sloan is one of the most despicable people I’ve seen on this show for the sheer reason that I believe Star Fleet is better than this and I’m angry that he was not. When he said he believes in the same principles..... I am tangibly angry. And Julian actually really doesn’t seem to want to play spy in real life.

In the Pale Moonlight: oh, here we go. 

Sisko made a big mistake right off the bat. When Garak asked if Sisko was ready for something bloody, Sisko said he was already involved in something bloody. But Sisko was not responsible for that bloodiness. It wasn’t his fault. Sisko is not going to be okay when this goes south. 

I don’t know why I was surprised when Garak murdered the Romulan senator. But I was. That scene between him and Sisko was brutal. I don’t think Sisko was honest with himself at any point until he deleted the log. In that moment, he wasn’t okay enough with what happened to keep it. That or he didn’t want Garak to get in trouble. I don’t know why he thought it was a good idea to let Garak on the ship. 

This episode was incredibly exciting. Garak is probably my favorite character. I don’t know who’s side he’s on. I don’t know if he has any idea what’s right from wrong. I’d say I’m not sure if he has any morals at all but he did- he has chosen our good guys more than a few times. 

I loved the way Sisko’s character was played here. I don’t love what they did with him. And by that I mean I disagree with what he did. But part of that comes from believing that none of the other captains I’ve seen would have done the same thing. I think Sisko contradicts/challenges a lot of what I believe but subtly. It’s impressive that they’ve written him this well, and I’ve gotten way more comfortable with the way he plays the role.

These characters in DS9 seem so frustrating and pointless.

Sisko is alright, he does have a bit of a temper though.

Kira is also hot headed and seems to have an arbitrary position but I guess she's essentially the ""first officer."" Although she's not starfleet so her ethics are questionable.

Odo is also not starfleet, he also is quick to a temper. Seems to constantly get in arguments about starfleet protocol. He's also the constable (chief of security) and refuses to use a phaser.

Quark is pretty obnoxious so far, constantly taking the lower moral route, obsessed with profit, anything he can to weasel his way out of situations. Quark and Odo seem to hate each other.

Dr. Bashir is egotistical and a womanizer, finally we get someone without a temper. His acco.plishments on paper seem quite impressive but he doesn't seem super competent when his skills are needed.

Dax's role seems arbitrary, she is an exobiologist which seems like a role that should've just been another skill for Bashir to have, because they are both experts on biology.

O'Brien is alright, hes a pretty good character and his position is useful but he also doesn't seem to have much of a personality.

So far DS9 has just been people clashing heads and yelling at each other, and a few of the characters skills/positions seem useless. Its nothing like the order of TNG or voyager where everything is kept very proper and everything is to code and everyone does what the captain says.

Does this change or is it something I have to adapt to? I love star trek and would love to get into DS9. I know Worf comes in at some point so I'm excited for that.

Weird that there’s a post on the front page about how Star Trek cares about mental illness just as I watch an episode about the federation’s attempts to “cure mental illness for all time”.

A strange one this. My feelings kept shifting on it because it had moments of absolute crap mixed in with moments of absolute excellence. They sort of cancel each other out so it turns out merely acceptable despite the peaks and valleys. Quite a wild ride along the way though. Let’s get into a chronological overview of the episode because I have something that needs to be addressed about the way it starts.

NO, IT DOESN’T JUST LOOK LIKE A SCOOP OF CHOCOLATE MINT ICE CREAM, IT’S LITERALLY A PHOTO OF A SCOOP OF CHOCOLATE MINT ICE CREAM. Can anyone confirm this?

So they get down to the prison planet and meet the governor, and it’s good to see an Asian man in a position of authority. (Oh my god! I didn’t recognise him, but I look at the cast and it’s Xīqí Lu, who is a huge deal for Asian-American actors. He was a founding member of the Screen Actors Guild, and among the first Asian men to have a respectable Hollywood career, securing prominent roles in productions in the 30s when it wasn’t unusual for studios to use white actors in yellow face instead. He married a white woman and they had to go to New Mexico for the ceremony as interracial marriages were actually illegal in California then! A real pioneer. I’ve seen him in old Charlie Chan and Green Hornet serials, and you may remember him as Mr Wing in Gremlins or Master Po in Kung Fu. And, er, he was also the original Brak in Space Ghost. YES REALLY. What a career.)

And look! We‘re not even up to the titles and there’s another significant cast member who I also didn’t recognise until I scanned the credits and saw the name. Marta is played by Yvonne Craig, the original Batgirl, another pioneer, this time for women as superheroes. Craig’s certainly a very good looking young woman, doubtless why they gave her the part, but her acting skills are dubious. She’s quite bad here actually, bad enough that I wonder if am I looking back on her Batgirl with rose coloured glasses. I’m afraid to rewatch her in Batman and realise she was terrible all along\*. But WHAT IS IT ABOUT SCI FI FANDOMS AND BOINKING GREEN LADIES? Always green. I wonder if there’s genuinely some psychological thing going on here, has anyone ever analysed the trope of sexy green skinned women and why it’s specifically green?

(\*Against my better judgment I went on YouTube and saw an eight minute montage of clips of Craig as Batgirl. Another childhood memory ruined. She’s AWFUL. Just terrible. Every movement and line of dialogue is awkward and phoney. Mind you on the 1966 Batman show - hey I just realised the Adam West Batman has the exact same lifespan as TOS!- being campy and awful sort of enhanced the vibe. At least she’s bad in an endearing way.)

Getting onto the plot, the fate of a starship captain who was broken by the job is interesting, except we have already seen this multiple times in The Doomsday Machine, Patterns Of Force, The Omega Glory - OMG I’M SUCH A NERD. What has this marathon done to me? I feel like I need to go to a bar and drink eight bears while shouting loudly about sport teams.

Neat, there’s an Andorian in the cells. This is nice subtle lore because I remember from Journey To Babel that this race was established as being psychotically violent, and we also saw one as a gladiator in The Gamesters Of Triskelion - I’M SUCH A NERD. But this is one of the best pre-credits scenes TOS has had. They’re doing Arkham Asylum. Spock and Kirk alone in an asylum of crazy space criminals is a great exciting setup. It took me a couple of minutes but I’ve just mentally completed the titular phrase “Whom the gods would destroy they first make mad”, hence the mental illness related plot.

After the credits things start to go off the rails. It’s not the fault of Lu (or Luke to use his stage name) but the explanation he gives of Garth’s shape shifting power is super lame. Why not just make him some shape shifting species or something? And oh my goodness, Shatner’s crazy person acting is EMBARRASSING. Yes I appreciate he’s being extra unhinged to reflect the fact that it’s Garth in Kirk’s body but good heavens man control yourself. Not sure about Garth’s bath robe either.

Ihnat as Garth is a problem. His performance is out of the Adam West Batman show. (I guess having Craig here has got Batman on my brain.) Instead of a credible or looming threat, he’s a screeching buffoon and this makes it very hard for the story to hold any interest or atmosphere, compounded by the dreadful dinner scene which almost threatens to sink the episode. Their entertainment is playing wheelbarrow? “You’re the only woman on this planet you stupid cow.” What a zinger, great writing guys. This spat between Marta and Garth is pretty sad. Why is this scene even here, it‘s childish/inane. Spock and Kirk suffering through this are good stand-ins for the audience. Just listen to how Ihnat delivers the line “I may kill you with my bare hands!” After that thrilling opening this got bad FAST. I was all psyched up to see Spock and Kirk use their wits to survive an Outlast scenario, running a gauntlet of savage deranged criminals. Instead I feel like I’m actively having my time wasted. Ihnat may be giving the worst guest performance in Trek yet. He’s making me groan and shift in my seat. The anthill line alone. And then there’s “REMOVE THIS ANIMAL!” It’s like Ihnat was specifically brought in to make Shatner look good. And Craig’s deeply unfunny poetry running gag. Geez. Even the sets this episode seem a bit cheap, not up to usual standards. I suspect the asylum is actually the Enterprise in disguise.

Garth keeps saying “Marta My Dear” - is this a nod to the Beatles song Martha My Dear which had just been released about the time of production?

HOWEVER. Just when I’m about to write this episode off as a disaster, it takes a big step towards redemption once the dinner scene is finally over. I’m initially unhappy with the scene where Marta is seducing Kirk on multiple levels. Why is she in love with him? Why is she trying to kill him? Why did she arrange for Spock to be released? Gosh this is sloppily written I think to myself. But then there’s the fantastic AHA moment with a great shot where Kirk gives Spock a loaded look as he waits for the countersign that made me go “oooooh” out loud and everything suddenly makes sense in hindsight. I didn’t see that twist coming at all. There’s a shot shortly before the reveal in which Kirk, still weak from the torture device staggers in the hall and Spock supports him. It’s a nice touch, but also deftly stops the audience’s brains from thinking there’s any funny business here because of course that’s Kirk and Spock right? This element of the show was very well played.

But then it gets silly again with the stupid coronation scene, although it’s mercifully brief compared to the dinner scene at least. What a shitty crown. AND OH MY GOD I’ve just noticed Garth’s boots. But holy crap, Marta’s death, was that really necessary. You could delete it from the episode and it wouldn’t really matter, it just seemed cruel. I was sure Kirk would save her somehow. I’m not usually sentimental but in this case I think ending on a note of a possible genuine romance between the reformed Garth and Marta might have left a better taste in the mouth.

Even though I saw it coming with the way he had his arms draped around the guards, Spock is the dude with the double neck pinch, great moment. Plus it’s an excellent final scene with the two Kirks, lots of fun and tension. The quality of body doubles has greatly improved, and the double Kirk action is handled well. ”Shoot both of us” is a good line for Kirk too, though Spock does rather skip over the possibility that the cunning Garth might say it because it seems like something noble Kirk would say.

Deeply disappointed that Spock didn’t say something like “Captain, it was extremely difficult for me to distinguish an egomaniacal narcissistic Star fleet captain driven mad with power from... (\*warning look from Kirk\*) from yourself.”

So yeah, a real game of two halves, very erratic in terms of how good any one scene or element is. If I had to answer yea or nay though, I’d go with “yea” because I was entertained for the most part, but there’s the important caveat that some of that entertainment was at the episode’s expense.",startrek,Kayfim20,False,/r/startrek/comments/hhyxfl/whom_gods_destroy_first_time_viewing_reaction/

11,Long Time Star Trek Fan Finally Watches DS9: Season 6 episodes 15 &amp; 16,1593395618,"Honor Among Thieves: I’ll be honest: I was avoiding this episode a little bit because I watched the first ten minutes and realized this is not gonna go well for Miles. But the next few look so exciting so here we go. 

There was also a flash effect in a few (or a lot of) scenes of this episode so I couldn’t physically watch those, I had to listen. If I missed something please let me know (for those of you who don’t know- I have a lot of optical migraine issues related to light- dim scenes are hard for me to see and flashing/flickering can trigger blind spots that last for hours). 

It’s adorable that Mile’s fake girlfriend works at a flower shop. His imaginary girlfriend is his actual wife and that makes me so happy. 

For a torturing Miles episode, this could have been worse. He kept the cat! But I just don’t think Miles can be anymore broken than he already was. I liked seeing Miles’ version of morality. I don’t think we’ve gotten enough of his decisions yet because he’s usually not the one making the decisions. I liked his thoughts. Miles is incredibly focused on being a good man. Being honest, loyal to his spouse, honoring his commitments to individuals as much as to Star Fleet. Julian’s conversation with him was very revealing to me. Julian holds a sense of duty to Star Fleet itself, regardless of its conflict with his own morality. Miles doesn’t maintain that. It’s something I feel he learned from Picard. Some things are more important to him than duty. I think that’s also reflected in the family values of the episode.

I appreciated the purpose of this episode. A little sad I couldn’t actually see most of it. Every time I tried to click onto it, there was still something flickering. Either the light in the room, or the lightning. But I still got a lot out of it.

Change of Heart: Man I loved the argument between Worf and Jadzia. I am glad they switched back to this format with two random plot lines that run simultaneously. I think it lightens the show a lot, and it gives us a chance to see more characters. And I also loved both character sets for this episode. I enjoy watching Jadzia be adventurous and in this episode, more scientific than we often get to see her. Worf is being less awful, and they work really well together. And then who doesn’t love Julian and Miles together? That’s the best thing. 

Quark is awful. AWFUL. By the way, does anybody know if Tongo is a playable game in real life? Purely a curiosity thing.

This is so brutal and so sweet. I’ll come right out and say that I think Worf made the wrong decision, but I think he made the same decision absolutely anyone on this crew would have for anyone else on the crew. Regardless of whether or not they were married. I don’t know if I agree with that or not. It’s been a long time since I’ve been in love. And it was crazy teenage love. I don’t even remember his last name.

13,The Man Trap going first!,1593390921,"I am a production order guy as far as the Original Series is concerned.  The later series not so much.  However I have always considered TOS production order to be the true order and the one I always use. Nevertheless I can't really argue with success putting the episodes out semi-randomly.  It did help lead to the core foundation of the fan base.  

When putting The Man Trap first however there does seem to be a bit of holes.  After all its not a ""first episode"" per say its just a random adventure.  (On the side note showing The Cage or Where No Man Has Gone Before doesn't fix this because even through they are pilots they act as random episodes.  They even go and reference past adventures that we don't do in The Man Trap)  The Man Trap doesn't focus on the whole crew that much it is just a Dr. McCoy focused episode on a series that normally focuses on Captain Kirk.

On the other hand the world was introduced to Star Trek fully formed and fully dressed.  All the characters were now in their regular jobs and wearing their traditional uniforms.  If you watch in my preferred order these things tend to develop.  There is something nice about the first scene interaction with Lt. Uhura and Mr. Spock in their traditional uniforms with each true to their character.  It would almost perfect except the dead crew on the surface aren't wearing the right shirt color. 

I may be a production order guy but I can see why some like it the other way.

18,DS9: The siege of AR-558,1593384444,"(Spoilers for DS9 7.08)

Having previously only seen TOS, I started watching my way through TNG, DS9 and VOY in airdate order just over 2 years ago. It's been a journey. But no episode has had quite the effect on me of this one, even though 'Far beyond the stars' and 'In the pale moonlight' and even 'take me out to the holosuite' all made me cry (for varying reasons). 

Growing up, I had a complicated relationship with my dad, but we moved past it and I am actually now living with him since university finished - because covid. I always knew he had been in the army before I was born, but never any specifics until in recent years I learned the tally tattoo on his arm was a kill count from when he was stationed in Bosnia. We have never talked about his time there, except for when we've had a drink together, and even then it's been little but brief comments that make it clear he was in some very intense combat situations and he has suffered from PTSD ever since.

It is extremely strange to me that when Nog pointed out the soldier with a Ketracel white bottle trophy necklace, my first thought was of my dad and his tattoo. I couldn't stop relating the experiences throughout the episode to him since then. The thought that a Star Trek episode, more than any of the many actual war films I've watched, made me feel connected to that part of his life hit me hard. 

That's one of the greatest strengths of star trek, to reflect the reality in the fiction, and something I feel DS9 does better than any of the other shows (thus far). Everything in the episode felt so contrary to the Federation's principles, the use of the Houdini mines, the medics in armed combat, the soldiers being left out there alone to fight with a paltry supply drop as their only support. Yet it felt so very natural and real and inevitable as a depiction of war. It was a really really fantastic episode and it's not one I see touted high on the 'best episode' lists nearly enough for one of the most stand-out episodes I've watched of any Trek.

24,"A fascinating peek into the ""Star Fleet Universe"" - a deeply fleshed out offshoot timeline established in 1979 by one of the first licensed Star Trek board games",1593377678,"I just stumbled across this recently, and wanted to share with everyone here who appreciates learning about the past of the franchise and all of its licensed content.

The [Star Fleet Universe](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Fleet_Universe), established by the (only partially) licensed board game [Star Fleet Battles](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Fleet_Battles), is a unique timeline from the ""wild west"" era of the franchise that stands completely outside of the typical Trek universe. Unlike most other canon-incompatible work from the early years of Trek, the SFU has had an influence on later Trek strategy games, and even video games like [Star Trek: Starfleet Command](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Trek:_Starfleet_Command). Here's a brief and paraphrased explanation of the specifics of the license and its inherent limitations for its use of canon from Memory Alpha:

&gt;While this is a Star Trek product officially licensed by Paramount Pictures, it is granted only a partial license, and as such cannot mention specifics of canon Trek in the games, save for basic information. This game does not use the name Star Trek in its title, but incorporates the design of the Constitution-class heavy cruiser and the uniforms, weapons, aliens, and some of the terminology of the Star Trek: The Original Series era. Part of this license allows the game to depict information from the Star Fleet Technical Manual by Franz Joseph (such as the Federation-class dreadnought and Ptolemy-class tug) and also information from Star Trek: The Animated Series (including the Klingon projected stasis field and Larry Niven's rarely-seen Kzinti. It should be noted that the SFU Kzinti are very distinct from those of Larry Niven's works). This game's license forbids the release of characters, aliens, ships, or situations taken from any of the Star Trek movies or the Star Trek: The Next Generation era series. However, Amarillo Design Bureau has continually added their own ships and races to the game system, referring to their continuity as the Star Fleet Universe.

The [timeline of the universe](http://www.starfleetgames.com/documents/Timeline.pdf) is laid out very similarly to Star Wars' use of the ABY/BBY system and our own BC/AD system where Y1 is the year humans had first contact with Vulcans - everything prior to Y1 is written out as -Y(year). This timeline is intentionally very vague and contradicts with Paramount's canon timeline - according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Fleet_Universe), the Enterprise's five-year mission was from Y155 to Y160. Following Paramount's chronology, this would put first contact in the year 2108.

Factions that we are all familiar with from the series - the Federation, the Klingon Empire, the Romulan Star Empire, Orion Pirates, the Gorn Confederacy, and the Kzinti Hegemony - mesh with other galactic and extra-galactic factions created for the series. My personal favorite is the Interstellar Concordium, which is for all intents and purposes another Federation on the far side of the Gorn and Romulans' space. Another Federation-like government is something I've been surprised to see hasn't existed in the main canon for a long time, and it's a pleasure to see that the idea has at least existed here. As a side-note, the Tholians from the SFU are not natives of the Milky Way, instead they are refugees from another galaxy. I personally really like this explanation for why they are so biologically distinct from most other major races in Trek, who come from the same panspermic origins as detailed in TNG's ""The Chase.""

There's really so much to talk about with this timeline, but in the interest of keeping this from being a more massive wall of text than it already is, I'll keep it brief and focus on its biggest event. There is a long period of developments regarding relations (and wars) between the major factions of the galaxy until the outbreak of [The General War](http://www.starfleetgames.com/sfb/sfin/general_war.htm). This is basically Space War I, and marks the turning point from regional and faction-on-faction wars to major confrontations between all interstellar powers. This war lasts nearly two decades and has effects felt by the whole galaxy. Shortly after its end, extra-galactic powers from Andromeda invade the Milky Way.

I encourage y'all to give a read through some of these links if you're interested.

26,A Theory,1593375556,"Perhaps this has been done before, but I have a theory about star trek in general: have you noticed that the more hair there is on screen, the better the trek is? 

Season 1 of TNG: Riker has no beard. Season one of TNG is not that great. 

Seasons 2-7 of TNG: Riker has a beard, and the show rules. 

Season 1 of Voyager: Janeway has her hair up. Season 1 is not that great. 

Seasons 2-7 of Voyager: Janeway's hair is down, and suddenly the show rocks. 

Season 1-2 of DS9: Sisko is clean shaven. It's ok I guess. 

Seasons 3-7 of DS9: Sisko has a goatee and now I'm binge watching the show because every episode is so great. 

Seasons 1-4 of Enterprise are bad. Archer never grows a beard. Coincidence? 

Nobody seems to like Discovery (I mean, I do but I think I'm an outlier). Burnham has short hair AND no beard. 

There's not a lot of beards in TOS, but you know what the best episode of TOS is? That's right, Mirror Mirror. You know what's in that episode? Spock Beard.

29,Deep Space 9 Festivus,1593373256,"I just finished DS9 and, wow, I'm ready to air my grievances!

**What I Liked**

Favorite moment in the entire series is when Dukat calls Kira in the middle of the night and tells her that he fucked her mom, ""Hey, Kira, I fucked your mom, thought you should know, babe. Bye.""

The episode when Dukat randomly kidnapped Kira to join the Pa Wraith cult. That was some classic Dukat.

I liked Ezri Dax. As a kid I loved the movie the Cube, so when I heard Nicole De Boer's voice in season 7 I got super excited. I wish she had a longer run on the show and longer hair. She's a really great actress and her voice is very pleasant to listen to.

Then I really liked the villains: Dukat, Quark, Weyoun. I wish Quark was more successful.

I really like Garak.

I liked Keiko and O'Brien.

I liked when Jake and Nog were little rapscallions causing trouble.

**Questions**

First off, if Odo was sick since his visit with Starfleet medical, how could he have lived for 200 years in the past? Remember that episode where the crew crash landed and they met their great-great grand children? Why is Odo alive? He should've been dead from the plague.

Why are the Founders at war with the Federation at all? At the end Odo tells the female changeling, ""You can trust the Federation, they will leave you alone."" Then when he links with her and heals her she changes her mind. Then when they first encountered the DS9 crew they used those mind devices to see how far they could push the Federation. But they were pushing them into crazy concessions instantly. That's not how the Dominion would work. Look at how they slowly took more and more from the Cardassians. While we're talking about the concessions the Cardassians made, if the Dominion had that brain analyzer thing, why didn't they ever use it on Damar to see how far they could push him? You know, the leader of the Cardassians. Would've been nice to see what his limits were. Or how about Weyoun 6? Or even better, use it on all the Vorta clones so they don't go rogue.

What's up with Worf and the empire? He was excommunicado when he went against the empire. He was more than radioactive. Then he meets Mardok and Mardok falls in love with him and lets him join the house. And, like, no one cares? No one tries to kill Mardok or Worf after this? He's a Starfleet officer, but he's allowed to serve on a Klingon ship? WTF? Oh and Alexander. Did no one else think it was stupid how he joined the Klingon army? Was that not the stupidest thing ever? I always hated that little shit even in TNG.

Oh, and WTF happened to Quarks Klingon wife? Yeah, I know the first episode they get divorced. Then the second episode that featured her, Quark banged the shit out of her and, IIRC, he did everything needed to do to marry her. Also, in Klingon culture if you have sex once it means marriage is soon to follow. They just completely ignore that ever happened afterwards and focus on the Worf Jadzia thing.

**Airing of Grievances**

I wish Miles left Keiko for Julian. That would've been next level woke. There was that scene where Julian goes, ""You like me more than your wife, and I like you more than Ezri. Maybe we should elope and retire to Risa.""

After watching the complete series I really wish we had Ro Laren on the show instead of Kira. Kira wasn't bad, per se. In fact I liked her more than most other characters. She was hot and a really good actress. But I also don't like her voice. It's shrill. Also, I hated her first outfit. You know, the one with the shoulder pads. It looked stupid and she didn't look hot in that attire.

The time travel plots and period pieces including Vic. Jesus H Christ, quit it with the fucking time travel. I don't care. It's the most annoying shit.

The episode where Molly goes back in time and comes back as a teenage Tarzan. That was stupid as fuck. In 10 years she forgot how to talk or who her parents were? Really? She forgot who her mom was? Did she have severe brain damage or something? Then they bring her back as a teen and O'Brien complains. He says, ""Why can't we bring her back as a child."" Julian says ""Well, Miles, we'd be robbing her of those 10 years."" Dude, she's already been alive and dead. It's 200 years in the future. You just robbed a version of Molly of all the years she had after she was a teenager. Oh, and then the kicker, fucking, the O'Briens decide to steal a runabout to go back to the surface and send her back in time. That was hilarious. They decide the best thing to do for her is to send her back in time alone forever. That was actually hilarious, not gunna lie. It was still a stupid premise.

There were a lot of stupid premises. Like changeling Kira getting enveloped by the rock.

Worf was super insubordinate to Sisko. Just completely out of character.

They had some ridiculous situations. Like the trial for O'Brien on Cardassia. The episodes was trying to make the trial look ridiculous. It is ridiculous. The idea there's an irreversible verdict before the trial begins. But the way they tried to use humor was cringe and embarrassing. Whenever the show attempted humor in and of itself like that it failed miserably. 

Kai Winn didn't know that it was Dukat. That's so stupid. No shit that's Dukat. You couldn't tell by his face or super distinct voice?

When Cassidy gets out of prison Sisko pretends like nothing happened and tells her to go to Bejor with him because he was having visions. Come on bro. No explanation? No nothing? Just, ""Oh, hey, you're here again out from prison. Love ya!"" They also never explain why Cassidy was helping the Maquis.

I hated the black and white morality between humans and Ferengi. The only way they portrayed the Ferengi as having a valid culture was when Quark would say shit like, ""Hey at least we didn't have slavery. We don't have wars, unlike you."" And even then, they tried to portray Quark as the bad guy because he was super blunt and combative about it.

I hated how they portrayed Dukat as pure evil. And that comes with a caveat. I do like villains portrayed as pure evil, because some people are just bad. But they built him up the entire time as someone who was morally conflicted. That he wanted to do the right thing, but was pressured by his culture to do evil. Then he went fucking crazy and Sisko just says, ""Well, Dukat is just an evil bro."" How about a more nuanced view, ""I really thought there was good in him, but after he lost his daughter his mind snapped and now he's just a pure evil bro."" That shit really bothered me.

I hated how they dealt with philosophic issues as black and white. TNG would try to show a balanced view of the world. For instance the episode with Beverly and the Trill. That episode was beautiful. Bev had issues with her Trill mate taking over Riker's body. She could get around the issue, because Riker was a man. But when the Trill took over a woman's body she just couldn't get over it. The emotional love she felt couldn't overcome the physical attraction. Sorry, she just wasn't gay, bro. Then the two parted as friends. That was great. The Trill thought it was cool to be gay with Bev, and Bev just didn't go for it. Neither of them were wrong, they simply had a difference of opinion. In DS9, there were no differences in opinion. There was good and evil. And I really didn't like that shit.

I wish Quark got with Ezri instead of Julian. I didn't like the Ezri/Worf angle. I didn't really like the Jadzia/Worf angle either. Why is Worf a ladies man? First off, he looks like a monster. Secondly, Klingons smell bad. Third, have you seen those teeth? The dude never brushes. Ezri didn't even like Klingon stuff.

Oh, remember that episode where Odo and a few others go back in time with him inside Odo's brain? And Jadzia goes, ""I've run out of speculation."" Yeah, you know what, I ran out of respect for this show too.

Self replicating mines is a really stupid concept.

I could go on all day, I think this is enough. Does anyone else have any DS9 Festivus miracles?

Edit: I almost forgot about Vedek Bareil. He covered for Kai Opaka's scandal and lost the race against the evil Vedek Winn. Like WTF was that? Opaka decided to save something like 20,000 -civilians- by giving up the location of 100 rebels to the Cardassians.  She did the right thing and Vedek Bareil decides he needs to protect that truth from coming out about Opaka. First off, it it did come out to the public, no biggie smalls, I don't think anyone would really care. She did the right thing by protecting the civilians. Secondly, Opaka is stuck on a prison moon in the middle of no where. The people need a -good- Kai to lead them forward. Kai Winn was not a good Kai.

31,Am I missing anything by skipping TOS?,1593372703,"I'm new here and I'm pretty sure this post follows the rules but correct me if I'm wrong...

I was exposed to Star Trek as a young child, maybe as early as seven, but I never understood it much. My father put on TNG during dinner so I suppose that's how I came to knew about Star Trek but it never interested me. I also recall outright refusing to watch VOY as a child due to my crippling infatuation with B'Elanna Torres. That was one of the more embarrassing bits of my childhood that I never tell anyone.

Fast forward about 10 years or so. I'm 15 years old and TNG was on TV. Deciding I had nothing to lose, I sat down and watched it since there was nothing on cable at the time. I thought it was very interesting, now that I understood it more, and after learning it was on Netflix I decided to watch it from the beginning.

It's been five years since then and I'm now 21, currently binge watching DS9 with plans to watch VOY when I'm done because I'm afraid I missed out on it. I don't know much about VOY aside from the few episodes I've seen.

I don't have plans to watch TOS nor ENT.  My father said it didn't matter but that I was required to watch the trouble with tribbles because an episode of DS9 revisits it.

Is there any other reason why I should watch TOS or is it ok that I skip it? I never liked it as it was a bit cheesy compared TNG.

44,Should the Klingon Blackface Episodes be Pulled?,1593365943,"TV streaming sites have been pulling several episodes of television where white actors are in black make-up, with *30 Rock*, *The Office*, and *Scrubs* removing episodes or having those scenes edited. Netflix also recently pulled a *Community* episode where a character is dressed as a drow/ dark elf from D&amp;D for similar reasons: [https://www.thewrap.com/community-advanced-dungeons-and-dragons-episode-removed-netflix-blackface/](https://www.thewrap.com/community-advanced-dungeons-and-dragons-episode-removed-netflix-blackface/)

The thought is that showing white actors in non-human dark make-up is entirely unacceptable, even when satirizing blackface or showing it as unacceptable. And even when not depicting a real world human ethnicity.

This immediately made me think of Klingons.

In their appearances in TOS, Klingons are flagrantly white actors in blackface. But even in newer episodes, there's a lot of white actors playing Klingons. Gowron and Martok. Alexander. Lursa and B'Etor.  Kruge and Chang from the movies.

Heck, probably most Klingons in all the series apart from Worf and Kurn...

So, honest question: **should the Klingon episodes go?**

Should all the Klingon episodes go? Just TOS ones with the obvious use of white people in make-up? Or should *Star Trek* get a pass because they're aliens?

74,"Everyone talks about Tuvix but never about Riddles, why?",1593314243,"While watching the ST:VOY episode *Riddles*, I was struck by the similarities:

1) Both episodes involve an event which fundamentally changes characters into new beings. *Tuvix* had the fusion of Tuvok and Neelix, while *Riddles* features an injured Tuvok who essentially becomes a whole different person. 

2) Both episodes show new characters living good lives on Voyager. 

3) Both episodes have the new characters display new talents, joys and ambitions. 

4) Both episodes have a convenient way to restore the characters back to the way they were at the end of the episode.

There is a key difference which makes the decision to restore Tuvok troublesome in *Riddles*. Russ' performance suggests Tuvok possessed an underdeveloped mental state, like that of a child. Even in our ""backwards"" 21st century legal system, a person altered by a traumatic brain injury which displayed a childlike state would be ruled incompetent with a guardian appointed. In the 24th century it's apparent they thought Tuvok could consent. 

""But why not care about Tuvix's lack of consent?!?!"" - I hear you asking. Tuvix was a grown man acting selfishly and the correct moral choice is to choose the needs of the many every time. Being a selfish asshole is everyone's prerogative, but forcing a decision on what amounts to a child is actually monstrous. Even if you believe killing Tuvix was immoral, one ought to find the events of *Riddles* to be even more immoral.

My question to this sub is, outside of the above average quality of *Tuvix*, why isn't *Riddles* discussed as it presents an even greater ethical dilemma?",startrek,Anurse1701,False,/r/startrek/comments/hh7bwi/everyone_talks_about_tuvix_but_never_about/
75,Are the reboot Star Trek movies a good place to start becoming a Trekkie?,1593311986,"Okay, so I will admit I'm a bit of a geek. I love comic books, superheroes, some sci-fi and many more various types of movies in general. I've also always sided with Star Wars no matter what happens, with the exception of the terrible sequel trilogy. However, one thing that is always part of nerd/geek culture is Star Trek. 

For a while, I've heard of it. It's constantly referenced in one of my favourite sitcoms of all time, The Big Bang Theory and also Futurama once dedicated an episode to the show. I know two characters from it (By name only) who are Captain Kirk and Spock. So I would like to start my journey to becoming a Trekkie. However, since I'm very modern (I know, it's petty and stupid), I usually prefer more modern films. I may be able to get the original series somewhere but given the fact it's a TV series and it's quite an old show, I may have a hard time getting into it. 

This is similar to my experience with the Planet of the Apes franchise. It actually began with Rise of the Planet of the Apes for me, before I eventually saw the classic with Charlton Heston. However, the Reboot of the Planet of the Apes is my favourite trilogy of all time today, with Dawn being my favourite movie. I still had an open mind with the classic, despite it being dated, since I was familiar with the concept. I really loved it. So I was wondering if the same could be done for Star Trek. 

I start with the reboot trilogy first, then *maybe* get into the series and other shows like the one with Patrick Stewart. So yeah, is it a good place to start? Thanks!",startrek,Daviddv1202,False,/r/startrek/comments/hh6tpd/are_the_reboot_star_trek_movies_a_good_place_to/

79,Long Time Star Trek Fan Finally Watches DS9: Season 6 episodes 10-14,1593305829,"This is my second one of these today in case you haven’t seen the first: I posted this morning in an effort to get myself to do my homework after work. It did not work and I watched 5 more episodes anyway. 

The Magnificent Ferengi: uh.... UHH..... you guys already knew I was going to say this but uh... consequences. In a few days isn’t Quark gonna have a bunch of angry Jem’Hadar on his hands? 

The whole premise of this episode is really strange to me. Moogie went to Vulcan to get plastic surgery, got captured, and then because Quark got jealous of the hero’s welcome of the bridge crew, went on what should have been a suicide mission. With a bunch of other Ferengi, to prove a point. Then they killed their prisoner for the exchange, used neural stimulator to pretend he was still alive, and that somehow worked for long enough for them to escape.

I did like that it took place on that old station from the episode where Garak went crazy. That was an amazing episode, and that setting is still cool and creepy. I hope they use it again. 

Waltz: Maybe Sisko is less forgiving than I originally thought?

I loved this episode. I love the super creepy vibes this show is going for in some of these episodes. Dukat was excellent, Sisko was excellent. And I rarely complement Sisko. But at first I totally believed Dukat was feeding Damar war tactics. When Kira showed up I realized he was still crazy. And he is evil, but he is desperate for people not to see him that way. He almost doesn’t believe he is. It was very intense. He is desperate to change Sisko’s mind about him. So desperate he’d rather kill him than live knowing he will never win Sisko over. Which is so sad, in a way. Because had he genuinely cared for Sisko and gotten him out of that situation, Sisko would have changed his mind. Sisko would have been open minded. I genuinely believe Sisko is capable of that level of forgiveness.

I am also just fascinated by the level of creepy this show is achieving. This was captivating to me, and such a simple concept, just well executed.

Who Mourns for Morn?: why doesn’t Quark ever ask anyone for help? He does when he doesn’t really need help, in a whiny way. But he’s getting death threats and would rather lose half a fortune than tell someone. 

Having Quark do the little jump and clicking his heels together like a fairytale hobbit does not make it any easier to take him seriously. 

I really love the whole keeping Morn’s chair warm thing. That’s adorable. 

In general I had fun with this. It gave me heist movie vibes. I also love the scavenger hunt/puzzle format for movies/tv. Searching for something left behind- I find it exciting. Especially since Quark didn’t know for sure if it existed. And I liked the set of characters they brought on for it. I think they each had an interesting personality that came through really well.

Far Beyond the Stars: for obvious reasons, I appreciate the message of this episode. I think it’s interesting that Odo’s analog is the jerk in this story. 

It took me along time but I’m starting to consistently like Sisko. He was an excellent, strong character in this episode. I want to talk about the speech he made because he made two really powerful statements. “You can’t kill an idea,” and “It’s real to me.” Obviously the entire speech (and episode) is very poignant right now. I am not going to pretend to know how to talk about race or, more particularly, race in science fiction, so I’d love to hear everybody’s thoughts on what Star Trek has contributed, done well or done poorly, as part of that conversation. 

But I also want to talk about the concept of “it’s real to me,” because I feel like that is something a lot of us can relate to pretty viscerally. As I’ve mentioned, I grew up watching first Enterprise, then TNG, the TOS. And I personally got something very real out of it. A lot of very real things out of it, a lot of who I am. AJR has a song called Netflix Trip that describes this feeling. But it was kind of warm and fuzzy to see them acknowledge the impacts their stories have on people. I’d be lying if I said I don’t think it impacted my social/political views, and still continues to do so. I find I’m still learning about the intricacies of non-violence, not taking the easy way out, and forgiveness. I’m also constantly learning about creativity from this show. 

One Little Ship: I had so much fun with the concept of this episode. I mean, we’ve definitely seen the whole shrunken down concept before but it was just so exciting. The little ship flying by actual sight, not sensor. Doing the engineering by hand, moving little things around. Basically, a toy ship flying around and saving the real one. Just loads of smiles. Worf’s poetry joke at the end was also pretty funny. 

I’m curious about the conflict between the alpha and gamma Jem’Hadar’s. The discipline among alpha Jem’Hadar seems to be less strict. They didn’t pledge allegiance to the founders and their actions, which are supposed to be their allegiance, are dumb. I’m also still wondering if the Vorta are failed versions of Jem’Hadar. I have questions about Dominion genetic engineering in general.

I know why pretty much everything else in trek didn't work that way, everyone thought the Cage and  the motion picture was too slow, cerebral and not action packed enough, but honestly for me that approach to sci fi is the best and most enjoyable.  Like I love how different the briefing in the Cage is when they are discussing the serous implications of just what exactly the aliens are capable of and how much the crew are at a disadvantage.  In any other episode this briefing would be simple and over and done in 60 seconds.  But here they really take their time to go over every detail and reflect on just how alien this situation is to them.    Pike himself is treated as having no power at all against them, no seducing or strong arming them will work, so he has to very slowing peal away information from them and he brilliantly works out a way to win.

And the motion picture is just amazing to me, the best star trek has ever been in terms of dealing with a high concept sci fi idea. I honestly wish the sci fi aspect of Star Trek was more front and center.  That's why I love the TNG episode Where Silence has Lease whereas aparently most don't like it.  Don't get me wrong, the societal ideas and crew interactions are very much important to me, ds9 is my favorite trek show for a reason, and like I said that show couldn't work if it was like how I'm describing.

93,The immorality of captain Picard will lead to alternate reality formation,1593292240,"I had a strange dream. It was like I was watching an episode of Star Trek The Next Generation but also participating in a starfleet training op. They were giving aid to a people. Their world being descimated, I assume by energy from space and the enterprise can park like a shield in its path preventing harm to the planet. Oddly amongst their civilian population, a man who looked just like Q (John Delanci). 

Picard asks the question of whether we should be their saviour or the tormentor: should we save their whole planet, or a part- after all if we save it all they will eventually forget all about the enterprise, and put it down to a god, or ignore it all together. Or if we save a half those who survive will regard themselves as god's chosen few or treat those survivors displaced as pariahs for being from the destroyed part. 

Rather than consider this a training test, I must then question Picards morality. Is he saying this, not to test a student, but create an event that will cause or destroy the future Q entity as he explores alternate possibilities and becomes Q. If this is indeed Q they have stumbled across is Picard provoking him into a response revealing himself as Q? Or if this individual is a future Q, the event the enterprise is shielding his world from might be precisely the cause of his rise as the Q entity, or sacrificing half of his world might be the cause.
But if Picard is asking if we should sacrifice part of the world so they will always remember the enterprise, its an immorality inherent in saving lives. Its self doubt. After all, at superposition all life is the same life so asking if we should sacrifice a part of a larger whole is like asking if we should cut off the rotting hand before it infects whole the body- but doing so is immoral because we become the tormentor of the survivor leaving them with an injury they will always remember the physician, or cure that body outright even though they will go on with their lives without thinking they somehow owe us at least the memory of our having aided them in the future.

I know the perspective you ask that question from is immoral because you dont ask yourself if you should do either for personal gain of being remembered by the ones you save in the first place. 

But in the end the question of morality is irrelevant because saving the lives of others is about saving the part of you that is only you at superposition where all life is the same life. You save lives because you are the life you are saving even if you pretend (or think) thats not how the universe is.

The percieved options of perspective are: 'do I want to be tormentor or saviour?' And the immorality of self doubt would create the kind of Picard who would live in the Mirror Universe. 

The only perspective that matters is 'I am ignorant of my existance where all life is the same life at superposition because I am not at superposition.'

14,Long Time Star Trek Fan Finally Watches DS9: Season 6 Episodes 7-9,1593269833,"You are Cordially Invited: I loved this episode. You guys knew I was going to love this episode. That said, Worf is still kind of an asshole. I’m a little torn here. Jadzia is a scholar of Klingon culture, so when she agreed to traditional, she absolutely knew what she was getting into. No excuses. But the feminist in me is still kind of mad that the resolution to this episode was her getting on her knees, literally, and begging. Now, don’t get me wrong. I loved the episode. 

I even kind of loved their talk where Ben convinces her to do that. I think it’s a really good spin on the “act your age” speech that adults give their children. It was also a very intimate moment where Ben acknowledges that he may treat her like Curzon, but she’s not Curzon, and can’t expect Curzon to carry her through things. And let’s be honest, Curzon has carried Jadzia through a lot of crap. Obviously it’s hard to draw a line, but his name has certainly gotten her in close with a lot of Klingons. She did her own good work from that starting point, but she started pretty far down the line. So I’m glad we finally had that conversation. 

But Jadzia was also very right to me in that regardless of Curzon or his accomplishments, she has an element of pride that deserves to be maintained. The husband got to go on a soul searching journey while she got bullied by her future, I guess mother in law? I mean honestly I’ve come to respect Klingon culture in a lot of ways, including their more violent nature. I’m learning to keep in mind that my values are inherently human and even within “human” fall into another subset. So we can’t expect aliens to share those values. But uh... even in Star Trek, it’s usually the female or feminine unit that’s treated a certain way in a given random species. The obvious counter example is the episode Angel One from TNG but let’s be honest that was also kinda messed up. The obvious worst example is the Ferengi, which I know is the point, but I think we’re setting a pretty awful example by having Moogie never actually succeed in her liberation movement. 

I had a lot of fun, I was excited to see them get married, Worf’s soul searching journey was cool, Jadzia’s party was AWESOME (especially the morning after- every part of that was hysterical except the whole get on your knees and beg thing) (Were Kira and Odo in the closet?- by the way, love how we got around a difficult conversation by saying “look they had it.”). 

I imagine Discovery and Picard do a better job of reflecting modern values (I know from asking around that at least Discovery has a better reflection of modern understanding of sexuality). And I also know that I need to judge this within the context of it’s time period (which is why I overall still really liked the episode) but really come on, Worf. 

Resurrection: Come on, Dax, Kira has already told you she doesn’t like to see a man’s brains when she dates them. 

This episode paints Kira as a little more naive than I tend to feel like she is. They know there’s a 50/50 chance that someone from that universe is a bad person. They also knew that Bajorans were not necessarily good guys over there. So I see that we’re supposed to see Kira in this episode as blinded by seeing her dead ex boyfriend, except more exciting. But I just feel like at this point, Kira should know better. Someone other than Quark should have gone, “Uh, he’s a professional thief. We should maybe not trust him so much.”

I don’t have a ton to say about this episode beyond that. I’m not a huge fan of the mirror universe episodes. I like this one better than some of the others because, imo, it was a little less confusing, and also didn’t follow the same patterns. But it wasn’t a stellar episode either. And I would really like to see Kira as something other than a hopeless romantic falling in love with all kinds of guys on the show (except Odo of course). Everyone is attracted to Kira! 

Statistical Probabilities: “So we go down fighting. How terribly courageous of us.” I almost always agree with Julian, but honestly he has a lot to learn about spirit. 

It’s an interesting thought that Julian could have been a brilliant military strategist, but he chose doctor. That’s what’s so captivating about him to me. And in a broader context, it’s interesting to believe that potential could be applied to any field or any context. Julian can perform calculations with tremendous ease. He could have been a mathematician, engineer, etc. but when I think about normal people with average potential, it doesn’t feel so unbound. For example, my mathematic and foreign language skills are severely lacking compared to my other skills, and that’s after years of trying to develop both of them. I don’t think that I ever had an equal potential to develop in those areas as I do in my chosen field (biology) or even in something else, like history or art. We tell ourselves as children that we can be anything if we put our minds to it, but I’m just not sure that’s the case. Certainly not to the same level of excellence as we might have in another field. 

I absolutely loved watching Julian work with his friends (I don’t want to call them mutants- that just doesn’t feel okay). It reminds me of working on a science competition team in high school, finishing each other’s sentences, being part of a well connected team. Ender’s game vibes, anyone? And then I felt so sorry for how it turned out. I see the show is back to trying to break everyone’s spirit. I also see that Julian didn’t learn much from the Quickening. I love Julian and who he is but his only character evolution has been becoming more somber and sober. He’s still reckless but not in a hopeful way anymore. More in a completely arrogant way. It feels like the cookie cutter character flaw and it hasn’t shifted at all.",startrek,MrPotato2753,False,/r/startrek/comments/hguy6v/long_time_star_trek_fan_finally_watches_ds9/

17,Trying to get through Voyager - is it worth it?,1593268811,"I’ve been watching Voyager for the first time. I’ve deliberately avoided reading any reviews, opinions, or spoilers because I didn’t want them to influence my enjoyment of the show. And I’ve really liked it.

20,“Elaan Of Troyius” - First Time Viewing Reaction,1593263401,"Noob Trek 68 - Elaan Of Troyius aka “To Spank A Warrior Queen“

Helen Of Troy, I get it. Not ANOTHER Greco-Roman classical allusion based story. They must have been filming one of those 60s Roman orgy films on the next sound stage and had the costumes and sets around. Mind you, Plato’s Stepchildren was pretty rad (and practically was one of those Roman orgy pictures) so I’ll give this a chance. (The episode turns out to NOT be an allegory to the Iliad after all, it’s just an allusory name. This is the first of many many times I was wrong about where this episode was going. No episode has ever wrong-footed me more.)

Short story? I liked this. Long story? It’s complicated to explain in detail why I liked it. It’s problematic in some ways and I will not be the least surprised if some people hate it. It was a real “everything and the kitchen sink” episode, with a LOT of different elements and tones, but despite inducing the occasional eye roll, I found it mostly entertaining and engaging.

Our episode begins when Spock’s eyebrows reveal his long-suffering as McCoy waxes horny about Elaasian women. They proceed to the transportation room where OH MY GOD THE ENTERPRISE IS BEING INVADED BY CHRISTMAS CRACKERS. These may actually be the worst costumes yet. They’re just so orange and angular. I wouldn’t wish them on action figures let alone human beings. We proceed to have fun with costumes throughout the episode, as Elaan goes through more wardrobe changes than a Cirque de Soleil performance. Most of them look like rejected She-Ra designs, and the last one that splits all the way up and down vertically is quite risqué. My favourite is the one with the silver leaves. Oh, please tell me someone makes an in-universe Star Trek fashion magazine.

It’s a strange opening sequence though. What is the Doll Man I ask myself. It turns out the Dolhman is a refugee from Ken Russell’s Cleopatra who just stands there blankly while the music goes nuts. Never mind, I’m sure it’ll all make sense by the end of the episode. \*tries not to remember that I thought that about The Alternative Factor\*

At this point I have a feeling the episode is going to be silly. I just hope it’s the fun kind of silly.

Because of Petri I spend the whole episode thinking of mint ice cream. This actor is great though, he’s having fun and bringing the audience along. When he’s explaining his mission to Kirk, the episode was close to turning into an episode of Fawlty Towers. He has amazing hair too, and the way he manages to be obsequious comic relief while also suggesting barely murderous rage towards Elaan is amazing. Just check out the way he says “your lovely neck.” When he is seen with the knife in his chest, I was horrified, and was relieved he was still alive, so you know Jay Robinson did a good job of selling the character. I think it was wrong to sideline him in the sickbay- he livened things up, I could have done with more of him.

I realise I’m watching My Fair Lady in space. Oh goodie.

I’m really torn on France Nuyen as Elaan. At first I get it wrong because I don’t find her that attractive WAIT A MINUTE THERE’S A REASON I’M SAYING THAT and it’s because I thought they were going to do the Helen of Troy story. The whole point of that story was that Helen was absurdly mind-meltingly beautiful and Nuyen doesn’t reach those heights for me. (Who does? Maurishka Taliaferro from Operation Annihilate. You can tell my love is true because I can still spell her name correctly.) But of course it later turns out they weren’t actually telling the Helen story so it doesn’t matter. That leaves us with the issue of her vocalisation. Now when I saw the name France Nuyen, I flipped out because I’ve just been reading Shatner’s autobiography Up Till Now. He devotes a few pages to how Nuyen nearly sunk his theatrical career years before Star Trek by starring opposite him in Madame Butterfly and stinking up the stage, missing lines, suddenly leaving, having tantrums etc. (In her defence, Shatner notes that she literally couldn't speak English and probably should never have been cast, plus she had a toxic relationship with the director.) Shatner writes that he met Nuyen professionally again years later and enjoyed a much better relationship the second time around. I guess this is it. Anyway, though time has passed, Nuyen still betrays signs of poor English with some lines sounding phonetically recited given the strange intonation, lack of emphasis, and mispronunciation. This undermines some of her dramatic scenes. However, as the episode goes on I warm to her and think she does a fairly decent job of presenting an exotic alien warrior queen, though it is a bit B movie. And maybe it should be. (Btw I’m shocked to learn that this is apparently the first time a Vietnamese woman had ever appeared on American television.)

Kirk goes on to the bridge to shift the episode away from the knockabout comedy it was becoming by noticing a Klingon ship and introducing espionage elements to the story. I randomly observe that it must have sucked being Sulu, sitting in that damn bridge all the time while everyone else runs around the other sets having fun. Mind you given what happened to Uhura when they took her out of the bridge in Plato’s Stepchildren, Takei might be counting his blessings.

What a change of pace from the last episode I think to myself. That was a tight, somber, focussed narrative vision, this is just putting everything the show does in a blender. But the beauty is that both of these approaches can work..

Then we get into the scenes between Kirk and Elaan. Yes, well, ahem. During the initial scene where he’s reduced to teaching her tables settings I’m half expecting Kirk to say “One of these days Elaan... to the moon!” So he slaps her and she seems to like it and I begin to worry that this is some creepy shit about how she learns to enjoy being dominated by Kirk. (And it kind of is, but it’s still not as bad as Space Seed.) This episode is pretty sexist and it took me a while to see it because I was like “But look there’s a big strong female warrior queen, that’s pretty girl power, right?” Yet when I look at what Elaan actually does - she has tantrums, she gets all gooey over big strong Kirk, she just stands about uselessly and is only accidentally relevant to the drama at the end, it becomes hard to defend that she’s a liberated character. Then of course we have the line about logical women - yes, I understand it’s a product of its time but it’s still hard to take. Then Kirk burstS in on a sleeping woman and threatens to spank her (while about to teach her courtesy no less). And never in a million years did I think TOS, or any Trek, would feature a woman expressing interest in being sexually spanked. (Look at the face she makes on that line, it’s clear that Nuyen/Elaan knows exactly what‘s going on here.) If someone had told me that was in the episode before I saw it I would not have believed them. Plus her sudden 180 in character and the ridiculous crying shot - yeah this scene is a good source of cringe humour, but it also kind of sucks and is uncomfortable.

Would’ve been awesome if before the kiss she’d shouted “GOTCHA SUCKER” and slapped him a good one.

They also do the deed (the later dialogue about “what happened“ makes this fairly explicit) which I found upsetting because it seemed like a gross act of misconduct for Kirk to bang a bride he is escorting to a wedding of great diplomatic importance. However, I did eventually remember about the tears, and although that plot device is a bit silly, it does make sense of Kirk’s behaviour. (I also created a TOTALLY incorrect plot in my head where Elaan was playing Kirk like a fiddle by faking crying to infect him so she could manipulate him in her evil machinations with the Klingons.)

When the Elasian spy refuses to cooperate Kirk should have said “I understand you’re trained to resist any form of torture... but what about a spanking?”

McCoy and Spock walk in just as Kirk and Elaan are about to break out the ping pong paddles. BUSTED. I think by this point McCoy and Spock would be more surprised if Kirk WASN’T doing the alien warrior queen they‘re escorting to her wedding. It’s cute that they’ve taken Kirk’s weakness for you-know-what that I make light of so often and turned it into an actual plot point. (I mentioned this to my dad, that the closest thing Kirk has to a weakness is his comic inability to keep it in his pants, and he argued that it was actually good that the character was flawed in SOME way, otherwise he might be colourless and unbelievable. He argued further that captains often see themselves as powerful, commanding, conquering, heroic types, so it makes psychological sense for Kirk’s flaw to be an unhelpful preoccupation with bedding ladies and maintaining an exaggerated image of his own masculine success. Yes, he does overcome it in this episode with there being no need for McCoy’s antidote in the end, but his instinct for the carnal gives him a fair fight.)

I will say though, that Shatner acts this well. It’s no small feat too, as it would have been VERY easy for “scene where Kirk is distracted while commanding the Enterprise because he can’t stop thinking about the smoking hot chick waiting in his quarters“ to be unintentionally hilarious, but it isn’t because Shatner plays it straight, with an air of believability. We can almost see him fighting off the poison of the tears, mentally drifting back to Elaan before getting a grip and focusing on the bridge situation several times. It’s one of Shatner’s better performances of late.

I do know whether the reveal that the necklace is dilithium is genius or idiocy. It’s kind of smart in terms of how it succinctly explains the Klingon involvement and saves the day, but also kind of stupid in how unlikely it is, and that no one on the Enterprise, particularly Spock and Scotty, can recognise dilithium.

And Klingon ships are ugly.

I had this episode all kinds of wrong. I was positive that either Petri or Elaan would be revealed as the mastermind behind a deliberate diplomatic disaster but nope, that throwaway theory that Criton hooked up with the Klingons because Elaan wouldn’t go out with him is all we get. I was sure we’d get a reveal that Elaan really is cold as ice and doesn’t care for Kirk, so we would be less sympathetic to her fate, but no, she really does love him which doesn’t work on multiple levels. Too fast, there’s no trace of her character as originally established, it makes her “go marry and screw some random king you don’t know“ arc even less palatable. I thought she’d at least escape and run away to be a pirate queen in space and live her own life in some fashion that would absolve Kirk of blame for it. But nope, off she trots docilely to be married. And spanked. This show is so close and yet so far when it comes to gender progressiveness.

Spock’s line about Kirk being infected by the enterprise long ago is great however.

So yeah, a strangely lewd comic spy story with quite a lot going on, a lot of it undermined by the writer apparently prioritising milking sexy thrills and soppy romance out of Elaan rather than telling the best story they could. But still I had fun watching it. I think we’re in A Wolf In The Fold territory here - odd and not for everybody but I was entertained despite its issues.",startrek,Kayfim20,False,/r/startrek/comments/hgt8bm/elaan_of_troyius_first_time_viewing_reaction/
21,How Do Numbers Work? [A Tale of the Occupation of Bajor],1593263114,"The Occupation of Bajor lasted fifty years and produced 15 million dead Bajorans. These numbers are fairly clear, but there's a big problem with numbers.

If you create each of them in a vacuum, how do they interact? What would the Occupation look like in terms we truly understand?

Let's try to look at the numbers and see how they work out. 

On average that's 300k deaths a year and 822 per day. Memory Beta puts the population of Bajor at 3.8  billion.

The United States has about 2.8 million deaths per year, or 7,671 deaths per day. The US population is 328 million, or 11.5 times smaller. So if we adjust these numbers up to come up with a theoretical baseline death toll for Bajor we get 88,216 deaths per day. 

If we add in the 822 average and then get a percentage it constitutes we can figure the Cardassians caused a little under 1% of the daily deaths on average. 

If the Cardassians were to do the same here it'd mean they'd kill about 76 people a day on average, which is about 1.4 million people over fifty years.

He says a lot of stuff about not de-humanizing the enemy, and how they are just people like yourselves and not ""monsters"". He has this very Picard like attitude where he looks down upon killing and people fighting and holds himself very highly and above that sort of thing. But this annoys me because... well the dude was a Maquis. He was doing pretty much the exact same thing these people were doing before he joined Voyager. The other Maquis crew have had some non humanizing ways of referring to Cardassians. Hell, even O'Brien refers to them as ""spoonheads"" on DS9, I'm sure the Maquis have said worse. Sure he may have learned and changed his mind about these things because of his time with Janeway and co. , but the tone and way he says things is very much like it never existed and he was never a part of it.

46,Star Trek the Next Generation Fatigue,1593222506,"Hey so I started watching tng around late April after finishing up TOS and its films and generally I've enjoyed it the whole way through so far.

I liked almost everything in seasons 1,2,3 and 4, but near the end of 4 I feel like this sort of fatigue's begin to set in where just about every episode starts to feel overly formulaic and there's rarely anything overly interesting going on. Unlike with tos where literally anything could always happen, I feel like at this point in tng they've set themselves up to always have relatively mundane premises that don't often have that signature philosophical punch either.

And I mean season 4 like post ep 20ish or maybe a bit before that, don't remember. I mean I did still love the 2 part klingon episode and the season 5 bajoran conflict which is where I'm at. But on the whole I feel like the show's just gotten a bit repetitive recently for me, and I'm not sure if the show just had an off run at the end of season 4 or if I'm just a bit tired of the series and should take a break for a bit.

I think what helped offset any fatigue with tos for me was how much shorter it was, and then the tonal difference with the films pretty much gave me a new wind, and then tng did the same thing right after the movies so yeah. I honestly think I would've preferred a 5 or 6 season tng so that way i could get to deep space nine sooner and have a breath of fresh air.",startrek,MrThefaraz,False,/r/startrek/comments/hgkrrc/star_trek_the_next_generation_fatigue/

Don’t need an answer: does this mean going warp 10 is off the table now?

58,Long Time Star Trek Fan Finally Watches DS9: season 6 episodes 5 + 6,1593212560,"The Bold- Part 1: 
Dukat? Show how he is compassionate and forgiving? Oh, Ziyal. 

Were the Vorta a failed version of the Jem’Hadar? They have no sense of aesthetics but it’s something he seems to miss. Their eyesight is poor. I’m sure we are about to find out more issues with their genetic engineering.

Also I think Damar is an alcoholic. But I think that because amazon trivia said he is. 

I’m so proud of Kira for not killing Damar. It makes her a way stronger character to say that what he does when he wakes up is up to him. And then my heart melted when Sisko said his home is on Bajor. And then we got Ensign Nog! This episode is so happy despite being so bleak. 

Sacrifice of Angels: that is such a devastating title.

My entire self fluttered when Julian and Miles recited part of Charge of the Light Brigade. I almost performed that poem for a competition but chose Battle Hymn of the Republic instead. But I still have these beautiful memories of my father chanting it with me on the couch in the spring. It was a very intense feeling. Including details like that in these shows, old earth poems and song (Like Miles and Julian’s drunken ballad in season 4, I think) make this so beautiful to me.

Whoever pointed out that Dukat’s relationship with his daughter is far more intricate than I understood was completely right. I’m starting to see those values in him. He cares about her and has an inherent trust in her that he refuses to break. 

Does anyone have a good screenshot of the face Garak makes when the Klingons show up and save them? Because I need it to be my home screen. 

Uh guys I forgot about the wormhole aliens entirely. Honestly that was a bit of copout solution here but this plotline was getting emotionally exhausting (in a good way, but still) so I think they called it at a great time.

And Dukat, you are so surprised you lost but almost every bad decision was yours. Just a little personal message. And ZIYAL! STOP LOVING YOUR DAD. I’M SORRY BUT STOP. Just kidding too late. Honestly I thought Dukat was going to be the one to shoot her. 

The scene when everyone was reunifying but Garak was running around looking for Ziyal was brutal. 

And Dukat handing Sisko the baseball and saying, “I forgive you, too,” was a goddamn beautiful way to nail down that plot. Because Sisko was standing there forgiving enough to get Dukat the care he needs, trusting enough to let down the forcefield, understanding of what Dukat did. There was no spite, no resentment.

59,"Elementary, Dear Data - newbie reaction",1593212420,"After watching all of TOS in two months and TAS in one, I got started on TNG, and it was initially a disappointment. Yes, grab your torches and pitchforks, but none of the characters were that likeable to me - other than Q and Data, so I decided I would press on at least until the latter got his famous cat. Yes, I'm watching it in order, rather than skipping the first two seasons as everyone is telling me to. The only episode I could not bear to sit out was one where they go to a planet of sexy people.

Slowly the characters grew on me. Though they first put me off with their superpowers and tragic backstories, they got more interesting in their respective limelight episodes. I now like Riker, and the way he gets on chairs. Side characters like Lwaxana and Ralph Offenhaus were also all kinds of magnificent: but the writing really struck me. Not necessarily the plots, which were a mixed bag, but the individual scenes and dialogue just always worked. Picard speeches are my new addiction.

I finished the first season over the course of half a year, and now the first two season two episodes were perhaps okay written but profoundly weird in essence. One featuring an awkwardly casual alien pregnancy which is very hard to justify keeping inside this episode, followed by a new Q who takes the form of the giant space amoeba.

But then we get to Elementary, dear Data. There's shining performances by my new favourites Data and Picard, and the new doctor who is incredibly charming. I also think my viewing order is paying off, in how well this episode builds on the earlier Dixon Hill one, which has a similar premise but an anticlimactic ending. This show may not have longer arcs but it does consolidate and pay off what was set up earlier.

But this ending! Oh boy. There's a great new character in the form of Moriarty who gives a perfect performance as a 19th-century genius realising he's made of fiction. Then Picard doesn't trick him into desintegrating or blast him with a hidden phaser. No, they have a well written talk about matter and energy, and Moriarty, perfectly in-character both for his Star Trek persona as his Arthur Conan Doyle one, lets them go in exchange for the hope that he might some day he real. There's a lot more philosophy in this show than I'm used to, and Picard couldn't be a better character to deal with it.

92,Should Star Trek be better on race?,1593168967,"Was talking about *Next Gen* &amp; how Geordi was more than his disability as a character, and certainly wasn't defined by it. He wasn't the blind engineer. He was the Chief engineer. Struck me that he's not the black engineer either. I've never thought of him in terms of his race, &amp; I *think* that's good.

It's worth quickly saying I'm a white guy from Scotland, so my experience is surely different than it would be if I were a black guy from Florida. Never thought much of Falcon in the MCU for instance, but I remember a black director talking about taking his kids to see Captain America and what a huge deal it was for them to see themselves reflected onscreen. Anyway,

 I say *think* because while *Star Trek* has an admirably colourblind future, in *DS9* they weren't afraid to talk about Sisko's race and make it a central part of memorable stories.  There's obviously *Far Beyond the Stars* but also his initial opposition to the Vic program because it represented a lie that ignored the racial strife of the time. But then Bashir was never the Sudanese doctor. He was the gobshite wunderkind. The optimist who lost his smile. The boy who turned into a man. Not the token north African.

 Off top of my head, of all the characters of colour on the show, I'm not sure any of them had a focus on race. Burnham, Worf, Torres, Culber, everyone; they were officers, not officers of colour.  For the most part, as said I think that's good. But a show built around humanism perhaps owes itself to take more of a risk in addressing it. The reason *Star Trek* has lasted so long isn't because it's an exciting adventure in space. There are loads of those. It's because it aspired to something more. 

I certainly don't want, 'the \[minority\] character'. Stamets for instance, isn't the gay guy. He's a brilliant scientist, bit of an arsehole, explorer, and mentor who happens to be gay. His relationship with Culber is already one of the franchise's best. But should they do more, or is his presence enough? 

 Science fiction at its best is just a story about us hidden beneath lasers and spaceships. And 'us' right now are beginning to have a real conversation we've postponed for far too long.  So shouldn't *Star Trek* be one of the loudest voices in TV when it comes to Black Lives Matter? Or is it better to continue with a multiracial, multigendered, pansexual cast of characters who go on adventures and never address these things because in their world, bigotry is as much a non-event as pockets?

Just some thoughts. But *Trek* got left in the dirt over LGBT matters, overtaken by mundane shows few remember today (thanks, Rick) and at the least it should learn from that mistake. I don't like gatekeeping, but if *Star Trek* isn't pissing off bigots, it's not really *Star Trek.*  So every time some incel complains about *Disco* and *Picard* being, ""woke"", that's a win. That's *Star Trek* at its best, doing the very thing that's kept it in vogue for 50 years.

98,Star Trek Beyond as the successor to ENT's Terra Prime,1593154903,"Short little thing I've been meaning to write, but since I just rewatched the movie I figure I would do it now. 

One thing about the JJ-series of movies that has always struck me is that, for all their shortcomings in terms of canon, they occasionally try to make Enterprise exist alongside The Original Series. In the first movie it wasn't much more than a reference, with Scotty mentioning that he tested his transwarp transporter thing on ""Admiral Archer's prized beagle."" Into Darkness is the same way, with a model of the NX-Enterprise on Admiral Marcus's desk as practically the extent of the references.

Beyond is where things get interesting for this though. Pretty much the entire plot of the movie hinges on events in ENT, and it takes a lot of its aesthetic from the show. The USS Franklin has essentially the same layout as the NX-Enterprise (and a lot of its functions are the same, like instead of shields they polarize the hull plating and it is armed with pulsed phase cannons + spatial torpedoes), and its crew wore jumpsuits with very similar features to those worn in ENT. The main villain, Captain Edison, was a former MACO who fought the Xindi and the Romulans, and became resentful that United Earth and eventually the Coalition/Federation of Planets formed in tandem with many alien species. His hatred of the Federation is very similar to that of Terra Prime in ENT, who are a bunch of humans who resent that Earth was integrating into the galactic community. They try to force the aliens off of Earth by threatening to use deadly force, but are ultimately thwarted. Like them, Edison attempts to use force to hurt the Federation and their utopian vision, but is defeated.

The messages of both of the conflicts ends up being more or less the same. Terra Prime and Edison both grew out of a time when Earth was still practically post-apocalyptic. They watched as the Vulcans dominated United Earth as a protectorate, saw the Xindi attack kill millions of people, and as for Edison he fought in the war against the Romulans that we unfortunately never got from ENT. Both Terra Prime and Edison are proven wrong though, as the unity of the Federation and its diversity ends up becoming their strengths. 

It is an interesting choice for the mainstream big budget movie to be tied so heavily to a Star Trek series that by most accounts was not that popular, and the general public has more or less forgotten about. One of the strengths of Beyond compared to its predecessors to me is that it does root itself in Trek canon, without severely limiting the kind of story it can tell. Terra Prime's story line from ENT was cut short by the cancellation of the series, so it is kind of nice that something came along to wrap it up in a way.",startrek,Chindasuinth,False,/r/startrek/comments/hg2vgz/star_trek_beyond_as_the_successor_to_ents_terra/
99,I don't like TNG S4E21 The Drumhead,1593152944,"Basically it's the one where a Judge starts a witch hunt on the Enterprise, targeting in specific a noncom guy who's grandfather was Romulan but lied on his application that he was Vulcan, and Picard who tries to defend him.

Picard makes a lot of good arguments in defense of this man and personal freedoms in general. That's well and good. What is frustrating about the episode is that it kind of flies in the face of Roddenberry's vision of the Federation and yadda yadda you've heard that stuff before about Discovery, probably.

It's just frustrating because this concept could have worked but still fit in with the Federation ideals (see: all of DS9). In The Measure of a Man, a trial goes down to determine Data's sentience and right of choice and you can see the challenger Maddox succumb to points made, and eventually even calls him 'he' where before, Data was 'it'.

In contrast this episode's challenger is portrayed at first a respected Starfleet judge advocate to one who ends up raving about Romulan collaborators in a trial. Yelling that Picard poses a threat to the 'Federation way of life'. I just don't see how we're supposed to get anything out of this episode if the prosecution is so obviously hypocritical. It's disappointing because she was set up to be so intelligent and strong.

How could such a character have ascended to this position in the Federation when everything she says flies in the face of it? We can't respect the entire trial or even the outcome when the prosecution never had a chance to begin with. In contrast in The Measure of a Man, Will Riker giving his best shot at advocating for the other side shows that the truth will become more solid when challenged wholeheartedly.

0,"I just finished ST: Picard, and sorry guys but I loved it! (mild spoilers)",1593149758,"I started it way back when it premiered but never picked it back up because it was a little slow to get going and so many people here said so many bad things about it, but I just finshed that finale, and god damn that was amazing! I won't spoil it for anybody who still wants to see it, but we got to see Picard go from a broken man to emerge as the Captain we all knew and loved! And so much fan service, but tastefully done IMO. 

To the complaints I heard: 

1) It's too dark, too hopeless - Meh, I don't see it. Yeah people get killed, more graphically than in other versions we've seen, but my take on that is this kind of stuff always happened on Trek, it was just filtered for us for prime time. And hopeless? Because the Federation has made poor moral choices? Well, that's not new is it? We saw the Federation make a lot of bad decisions over the course of Star Trek history. And honestly, we saw them at their height in TNG - every since then (over the course of DS9, Voyager and the movies) Starfleet seemed to be losing its moral shine. But at the end? Hopeless? The Federation does the right thing in the end. They always do. 

2) ""I don't like the cursing!"" - Again, meh. Once again my theory is that the cursing has always been there. You mainly didn't see it because most of the action took place on the Federation flagship. And again, it was filtered for prime time. Remember, it's likely they're not even really speaking the same English we are, so the curse words may not even be the same thing we're hearing. 

3) ""I can't watch this with my kids!"" - Because of reasons 1 and 2 I guess. Your young kids? No, I guess not. But there was nothing there I wouldn't watch with my 14 year old. Not all Star Trek has to be for all age groups. You wouldn't start your kids off with this anyway. Let them watch it after they've watched all the rest in a few years. 

4) ""Cigars, vaping, booze?? Harumph!"" - I mean, really? Ever smoked a cigar, or vaped? It's fun. The shitty part is it's bad for you. I assume by the 25th century that's not true anymore. And they always had real booze, just not on the Enterprise (except for the occasional stash Guinan kept).  

5) ""Nothing really happened"" - I heard this a few times. I mean, really? All organic life was threatened? Massive space fleets? The Borg? 

and finally 

6) ""I don't like Star Trek showing me broken people!"" - We're human beings. We'll still be human beings in 400 years. And again, they start off broken but become whole. 

Now, my highlights? Seven of Nine kicked all kinds of ass! Captain Rios may be my new favorite ST character in a long time.  The fan service was voluminous but rarely in your face. And Soji's journey of discovery seemed authentic. And it was nice catching up with some old friends. 

Was it perfect? No. Again, it was slow to get going. The ending while cool, was a little predictable. But to those of you who say it didn't feel like Star Trek...I just disagree.

Q&amp;A: Okay. I enjoyed it. Though a little bit strange.

The Trouble With Edward: That just... that was not really necessary. Memory Alpha mentions that they used a different scientific name in this episode compared to other episodes, so maybe there's a way to clean this up. Though, this isn't the first continuity snarl of the franchise. I doubt it'll be the last.

Ask Not: Interesting. I'm happy with this one.

Ephraim and Dot: Aside from it being just bonkers and giving off vibes from the less desirable side of Star Wars Resistance, I don't mind it too much.

The Girl Who Made the Stars: I liked this one. A folktale with a Star Trek twist. 

Children of Mars: I mean... a segway into the Picard series but holy crap! The episode previews mentioning this one didn't do it any favors. I think this one is my least favorite. Like... I remember hearing how schools stopped mid class for 9/11 and I got the exact same vibe here. I don't think I'd mind so much if it wasn't alongside significantly more lighthearted stuff.

I don't hate Short Treks. But as it stands they need to be a bit more consistent in feel and tone. This just went all over the place and it didn't mesh well with me. At least they aren't essential viewing. Though the connection of Runaway into DIS season 2 is a possible exception. For now, I'll just wait and see. But worst case, I'll be able to look back on this small series and laugh along with everyone else saying ""what were they thinking?!""",startrek,Alex_Russet,False,/r/startrek/comments/hg0gj2/finished_short_treks_and_yikes/
7,"I know enterprise gets a lot of hate and its not my favorite trek series but damn, im watching Demons/Terra Prime right now and its super relevant to current times.",1593140081,"Particularly in the second episode, but both are pretty great at portraying exactly how white nationalists (or xenophobic nationalists in general) think/act and the misguided reasoning for why they do so.

I forget his name at the moment but the main “villain” has a talk with T’Pol about her mixed-species baby early in episode two and makes the whole “this is bad for both our people, in the future humans and vulcans wont be a thing, we should all be separate and keep to ourselves” and if you replace human and vulcan/aliens with with different ethnicities on earth currently, its the exact same argument white nationalists use. yes there are xenophobic nationalists from every country throughout history but im focusing on the current issues.

But what i really liked was T’Pols response about how neither of their people were the same as their ancestors were in the distant past and they wont be the same in the distance future. basically speaking the truth and saying its a necessary step in evolution. Diversity is the future, for now the focus is diversity on earth. maybe some day it will be like this show and people will have to fight for interspecies diversity/rights. but i found this episode to be a good parallel to current events/society and does a good job at showing how misguided xenophobia/nationalism many years before white nationalism became as rampant as it is now in america and European countries. 

anyway, just some thought id being up the two part episode as im watching it right now and im only 10 minutes deep into “Terra Prime” and had to pause it to share my thoughts. its just so spot on at depicting xenophobia as wrong; even when people might have their misguided reasons for it (the xindi attack which was meant to parallel 9/11) there is no excuse for it and it is not for the greater good. it holds back progress.",startrek,chemical_musician,False,/r/startrek/comments/hfzpay/i_know_enterprise_gets_a_lot_of_hate_and_its_not/
8,“The Empath” - First Time Viewing Reaction,1593139409,"Noob Trek 67 - The Empath

So far I’m liking Season 3, it isn’t the train wreck I was warned off. Yes it’s contained dubious episodes such as Spock’s Brain and For The Title Is Longwinded And Who Has Time To Remember It, but there’s also been some really strong and interesting stories, like this one. I think it’s not so much that Season 3 is “bad”, but that it‘s “quirky”. I’m speculating here, but I understand the show knew it was facing cancellation at this point, but also knew that it had picked up an audience of weirdoes who loved how out-there it was. I wonder if it was trying to double down on that demographic by becoming increasingly far-out, with an almost lysergic quality to some of season 3. I can see how that’s a turn off to those who preferred the more serious, cut-and-dry sci-fi approach, but I think for the most part it’s just a different kind of good.

(Disclaimer: I write this being only halfway through the series, so it is entirely possible that the wheels come flying off at some point and I will regret what I just wrote.)

That paragraph above isn’t placed in this review coincidentally, it’s this episode that cemented this feeling in my mind. Dream-like and trippy (e.g. when the camera continually zooms in and out while Kirk is being tortured) and at times reminiscent of student theatre, yet with a solid, well-executed script as bedrock, it was another strong entry.

It was a strange beast dramatically - a very high stakes opening with a powerful force effortlessly defeating our three major characters straight off the bat. And yet what follows is one of the most action-free episodes yet, with virtually no combat or action sequences. Instead we find ourselves in a black void in which we will spend most of the episode. The producer must have been pleased here, because this cost-conscious set actually works very well dramatically too, adding to the atmosphere and eeriness of the Vians immensely. And it isn’t to suggest that the episode skimps on visuals entirely, as the Vian makeup is excellent, as are the artificial wounds on the various actors. In fact, the makeup the near-death McCoy sports is uncomfortably convincing.

The Vians are pretty great. They do a gradual transition from presumed-villains to sort of heroes, and the two actors successfully project an air of super-powerful-yet-still-kind-of-clueless. They seem formidable yet not entirely unapproachable, with an air of reason and curiosity to them. You can almost see their distant humanity being stirred by their interactions with the crew, there’s a more cohesive, convincing characterisation than the usual “look we’re just really powerful ok” super-beings we usually see.

Katherine Hays as “Gem“ was harder for me to evaluate. I sort of flipped on her - initially I found her to be almost a parody of the sort of pretentious goth girl drama student I used to date with her near-comically dramatic gesturing, but it grew on me and I came to like the performance by the end. In Hays’ defence, the character is mute which means all the characterisation has to be in her movement and face, which partly excuses some of the “I AM ACTING” theatrics.

It’s also a good episode for the dynamics between the big three. There is the bum note of McCoy being so stupid he doesn’t realise knocking out Kirk will put Spock in command, BUT, though the show never makes this explicit it’s possible that McCoy is play acting and was planning to knock out Spock all along. It is significant that it is McCoy who is the sacrifice as he is established as being the softest of the three, and ironically this drives him to take charge of a situation and defy command because such is his drive to spare the others. It’s testament to how successful the episode is that I found McCoy’s “death” moving even though I was certain he wasn’t actually going to die.

I’m not sure that Kirk’s final speech about the Vians being unfeeling intellect who have forgotten how to live makes sense given the noble, moral quest they are undertaking. I do however love the ending when Kirk suggests to Spock that Vulcans could learn from human emotion as the Vians did and Spock replies with “I shall give the thought all the consideration that it is due” which is Vulcan for ”Fuck off, captain.” 

So yeah, a still, quiet episode, not one to watch when sleepy probably, but I think they pulled it off and I admire the change of pace. It’s the second action-lite episode in a row - a huge amount of Wink Of An Eye was Della and Kirk conversing in rooms - but to the credit of the writers and actors they’re making it work. (One imagines that after the WTFapalooza that was Plato’s Children when anything could happen anytime, the production team needed to tone it down a bit and make things more static or dialogue focussed for the next couple of episodes.) I wasn’t bored, I wanted to know what would happen and what the Vians were up to, and even though it turned out to be a fairly generic test of moral character story, I still liked it due to how well it was made.",startrek,Kayfim20,False,/r/startrek/comments/hfzjpd/the_empath_first_time_viewing_reaction/

11,Long Time Star Trek Fan Finally Watches DS9: season six episodes I dunno the next two,1593138033,"Guess who didn’t get their homework done today?

After my forgetting some really major points in the last post from previous episodes, I’m going to try to focus on discussing broader plots than character details and writing after the episodes again, instead of while they are on. You guys know the show is funny, I don’t need to quote it to you, but I do need to remember and understand better to keep up with what’s going on. These aren’t stand alone episodes anymore. 

Sons and Daughters: I am starting to see the parallels between the station plotlines and the front line plots.
 
I liked this episode, a lot actually. I hated the Klingons as a kid because I found them kind of gross and brutish, but I have so much respect for their values now. They are violent which of course I don’t 100% support, but they are bound by rules that make it fair, and I’ve really come to respect the level of detail they have. I love watching them on their ship, the way they interact. I was definitely invested in Alexander’s success on the ship within about 0.3 seconds. They did really great with the comedic aspect of that plot as well. It wasn’t so awkward it hurt, but it was awkward in a way I think a lot of people can see themselves. 

Dukat still makes me sick. Possibly even worse in this episode. The way he turned around and handed his sexual gesture for Kira to his daughter... UGH! It’s so sad that Kira thinks there is no contest between her and Dukat in Ziyal’s mind. Kira has saved her ENTIRE LIFE from her own father how many times? Three now? Kira believes in her. Dukat finds her mildly amusing from time to time. Kira is absolutely a mother to her in a really strange way. 

Behind the Lines: hahahahahaha Sisko doesn’t want to be promoted. Five years ago Sisko would have wanted to be promoted but this is HIS WAR, DARN IT. 

Kira is constantly talking about how her people exist: their religion, law, culture, traditions, history, art, etc. but Odo wants the most fundamental unit of connection to his own people and suddenly it’s all, “Oh no we’re going to lose the war and your people are gonna destroy the alpha quadrant.” Don’t get me wrong I love a good Bajoran political episode, probably more than these pew pew pew episodes. But Kira does not give Odo the same respect he gives her. That said, she did turn around and seem to respect him more later in the episode, giving his opinions more weight and attention in their meeting. Buuuuttttt she may have been right the first time around. Oh, Odo...

See the thing about Worf is that I seriously, seriously trust him to come back to his Federation captain, whoever that may be at the time, because he believes in Federation values, even if he also believes in Klingon ones. Odo has just been brainwashed in about three seconds flat. When Kira pointed out how many people would die and Odo said that it didn’t concern him, I was like whoops we lost him. And it sucks because right up until then I was so happy that he was finally going to get to know his people. 

And as for the founders, I sort of respected their fear of the solids up until this point (I didn’t respect their decision to rule over them as dictators out of that fear, but I understood the fear itself). But they have made a whole zero attempts to even consider talking to the groups in the alpha quadrant. If they had asked, Sisko would have brought them to earth and shown them what the Federation had accomplished. But NO! They infiltrated earth all sneaky instead and decided taking over is easier. And boy I hope Nog gets out of this.

I’m going to be honest, while it’s cool that Jadzia got her own command, and she probably earned it and is definitely capable of it, it was a little heartbreaking to watch her give Sisko’s speech. In my own life, I’ve never had a friend who I would give up ambition for like they do. Like if Jadzia were reassigned, she could be promoted. But she chose DS9 to work with Ben and she belongs there. She doesn’t mind serving under him. And I’d rather live like that. I want to be on a team of people I trust so greatly that I don’t feel the need to constantly fight for my position. I just felt the love that Sisko was missing when he didn’t give that speech... it’s like Riker on the Enterprise. He did turn down his own command, something they made super clear from season 1 he has always wanted. Because at the end of the day, he wasn’t going to find a better place. I just want wholesome, guys. 

Uh, did we lose Garak and Julian? Like, poof. 

Also just a side note- I loved drunk Quark. Loved it.

I am not in love with the way this season so far is one big ol war. I don’t dislike it, per say, but I really miss stand-alone episodes and Bajoran politics. I usually prefer mostly stand alone episodes, in things like Doctor Who, Andromeda, etc, and with exceptions like the Expanse or Nightfliers (but both of which I knew were one big long story when I started them). DS9 is doing it really well, and I’m still finding myself laughing a lot. But overall the show is way heavier. Somebody told me that it got more somber after we find out Julian is genetically engineered and whoever said that- this is not at all what I thought you meant. But I am still constantly amazed by the creativity in the writing. Because I tend to reduce the pew pew pew episodes to (well, either pew pew pew episodes, or) “space war” or “space war with some spy stuff thrown in” but this is so much more than that.

The flair and excitement for the unknown maybe enthralling as much as tales of heroic captains but me? I want to have the whole view of the 4 quadrants. I want to strategize the entirety of starfleet strategy. I want to be the iconic Emperor/President of the federation of planets and have direct access to the systems that govern the federation on every star system of the federation from Sol to the 4 quadrants.

Though Im elated for the continuing series of Star Trek Online, VR Star Trek Bridge Crew, and various other trademark games of star trek....there was never a game of star trek with total control of the entire galaxy and immerse into an entire canon and non-canon lore of startrek unfolded as you make decisions as any of the races or federation

With that in mind, please allow me to introduce the game that got me back into the Trek Universe with as much immersion, new storytelling and to create a star trek canon galaxy of your own;

STELLARIS

A space civ 4X game like any other, stellaris has you immersed in an undisturbed pristine universe with your homeworld, starbase and the first FTL ships. Think of its starting as the turning point past ST:First Contact with Zefram Chocrane. Every aspect of the game is customizable from Species types and their traits to the various designs of your tiered class ships. Given that the ships may not look exactly like star trek for fear of copyright infringement, lets leave some leeway there.

You will embark on a journey of a species not unlike star trek  but unlike any star trek games that have come to date. I only wish the developers of star trek would have thought of this sooner.

Granted the hyperlanes arent part of star trek canon, consider the hyperlanes just unfettered access of max interstellar warp routes that has been scanned and cleared of warp course plotting obstacles.

The research has so many star trek nuances from fusion missiles to quantum torpedoes. The ai is reactionary but logical enough to roleplay/enact actual interspecies politics and relationships

Unlike other space 4x game, stellaris makes the effort of leaving the labels, species, progression and story abstract and procedurally random allowing more room for you to customize the galaxy to your own sci fi canons. Most other space 4x on the other hand have their own lores and fixed defaults of game pieces, Stellaris allows you to imagine and recreate your own.

66,Jean-Luc Picard: The Philosopher King,1593069456,"No Trek Captain/Commander can hold a candle to the greatness of TNG Picard. His brilliance stems from the believability of his character. Too often in our modern age hero's are written to be infallible gods of intellect and strength. In these types of heroes there is no connection to the human viewer because you are viewing something that is impossible. TNG manages to write Picard as what Plato referred to as a ""philosopher king,"" which is a term he used to describe an enlightened ruler that lived modestly, loved wisdom, and was highly reliable. Jean-Luc Picard represents a utopian vision of the advanced human being. The love and respect of fans everywhere for Picard doesn't just come from the aforementioned facts alone, but from one of the crowning jewels of his characters\` writing: he is a flawed man capable of making mistakes and experiencing immense hardship. The portrayal of Picard in this fashion causes the viewer to feel closer to the fictitious man. We cheer for him on his highs, and weep alongside him during his lows.  


One of the prime examples of Picard's humanness is in S04E02 ""Family"", which follows Picard returning to his home village on Earth after the events of being assimilated as Locutus of Borg and the resulting massacre at Wolf 359. While remaining stoic towards his Enterprise crew, his frame begins to crack over the course of his episode as a result of his brother deliberately goading him into releasing his pent-up anguish. Unable to maintain the facade of the proud adamantine flagship captain any longer, [Picard breaks down and shows us he is only human.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuzoxcErOc8) 

&amp;#x200B;

Another example is Picard's near capitulation to the fantastic empathic metamorph named Kamala from S05E22 ""The Perfect Mate"". Here we are presented with the ideal fantasy of an eager-to-please mate. She is highly attractive, playful, and her empathic abilities allow her to change her behavior to suit your deepest desires without you even communicating them verbally.  As the episode progresses we again can see that Picard is only human. The nearer to the end credits the episode gets, the closer you see Picard to surrendering his whole being to Kamala.  He even had to consult Dr. Crusher, the only person on the ship of equal status as himself whom he could have an honest casual conversation with, for advice. The experience with Crusher provided him a kind of self-served reality check, and he's able to hold on until the joining ceremony.

&amp;#x200B;

Picard represents a  higher form of human life achievable in spite of all our flaws and failings. It rationally suggests that while eliminating all the flaws, failings, and evils of human nature is most likely an impossibility, we can continue to evolve and improve just as we have been doing since ancient times.",startrek,big_cock90,False,/r/startrek/comments/hfhr1c/jeanluc_picard_the_philosopher_king/

73,"Long Time Star Trek Fan Finally Watches DS9: season 5 25 &amp; 26, Season six episodes 1 &amp; 2",1593051851,"Another long one, but for the sake of discussion: TL,DR: what are your thoughts on how Fake Odo’s love confession changed things for real Odo? Did Fake Odo mess things up for Real Odo and Kira permanently? Did fake Odo have any right to do that? And on a completely different note, is the Dominion really THAT bad (see below for elaboration)? Can someone explain the parallels between the station plotline and the Star Fleet plotline that Amazon says exist? + some gushing about episode 25 that put me in a really good mood for the day.

And now the long version:

In The Cards: I was so ready to tell you how I didn’t like this until the very end, and then it was wholesome and that guy didn’t turn out to be an evil villain. So first, why I wasn’t super invested initially: this show had two cliche tropes going on that I’m not super fond of. The first was obviously lying and letting something get out of hand. The second was a chain of people willing to do or trade one thing in exchange for another (in most shows that do this, it unravels at some point but then works out in the end). But then it worked out in the best way. Jake and Nog ended up doing a really nice thing for a lot of people which is super super sweet. And I laughed pretty hard about Julian missing Kookalaka. I was astounded that he let her borrow it in the first place. And they helped Miles get some time in the holosweet, and fixed Worf’s operas, and helped Kira give an awesome speech. It just made me so happy. Although I just noticed that it seems like nobody locks their quarters on this station, and Jake and Nog just walk right into places. And then of course, Sisko got the baseball card. So this episode was a pretty great way to start my day! 

A Call to Arms: Kira and Odo are so awkward it hurts. This whole conversation about being uncomfortable made me uncomfortable. Garak’s little story to Ziyal is adorable. They’re less creepy to me now but Garak seemed pretty surprised when they kissed. Nog was super cute with Lita but then he kicked her off the station. I feel like the theme of this episode is “Everyone’s love life is working out except for Odo’s.” 

My heart nearly exploded when I saw Jake helping in the infirmary. I’m glad they addressed the conflict that’s created by the fact that DS9 is technically Bajoran by Kira protesting Sisko’s control of the station. I was pretty sure they were going to leave that out so I’m glad they didn’t forget. And then I love how she slips right back into her role with the rest of the team. The Jem’Hadar dude saying, “This isn’t turning out the way I had planned,” pretty funny. 

YEP! Everyone but Odo with the relationships. I don’t know if this is a goof, but I think I saw Romulan ships in the final pan over the Star Fleet contingency, even though the romulans have a non aggression pact with the dominion. 

This episode was nothing special for me. In fact I’m pretty sure it’s aproximately the same way they’ve ended the last two or three seasons of this show. But I did enjoy it more than the last few season finales because it had more humor, more comfortable characters, etc. it was just more well written. I still felt like I had things to be happy about in the episode which I really valued and enjoyed. 

But guys can we talk about how badly fake Odo ruined things for real Odo? He has no idea what real Odo would have done if left to his own path with Kira. By telling Kira himself, fake Odo forced things to change for real Odo. Part of me thinks it’s going to work out because we all love happy endings, right? But this show doesn’t seem to work like that. They always manage to find something I wouldn’t have come up with. And they also love breaking Odo’s heart over and over and over. 

A Time to Stand: as always, I love a good Julian/Garak scene. I did write out thoughts on Julian as usual but honestly nobody wants to see them because you all know I love him. But if you change your mind I saved them ;)

I was so prepared not to like this episode but I loved every second of it. I don’t usually like the big dramatic space battles. But DS9 has a way of being massively creative. I was so excited as they get into the Jem’Hadar ship. Jake being a writer on the station is such a clever character insert. 

Dukat makes me sick. In a way that I’m not sure any other character has on a show before. I trusted him so much before he joined the dominion. The way he touched Kira disgusted me on a very visceral level. 

I was waiting for Odo to use his power over the Jem’Hadar leader to gain some traction on the station. Then I realized why he didn’t want to. And THEN I was upset that Kira kinda shoved him into it. But when Odo actually gained some traction, Kira flipped. Kira’s stance right now is a little wishy washy. 

I’ve been meaning to talk about this for a LONG time so I’ll put it here and I’d like to hear people’s thoughts. Is joining the Dominion THAT bad? Because all they’ve done is sign non-aggression pacts and fight the Federation. The terminology is bad- Cardassians want to “take over the alpha quadrant.” But what have they done? They took back territory that had been lost to the Klingons and a space station that, while used to abuse the Bajorans, was built by Cardassians. And they signed non-aggression pacts. And they honored them. Kira talks about that a bit in the next episode. She lives comfortably on this station. They want to take down the Federation, and they are willing to do awful things to do it, but, the Federation also chose to fight. It feels like a “takes two to tango” situation. And the Vorta make shockingly reasonable decisions. 

Rocks and Shoals: Guys Miles tore his pants and I needed that. I needed it so badly. This show has me laughing and crying within seconds of each other. Miles tore his pants, then Jadzia was in pain asking Ben to bring her home. Garak gave up with the communicator question. Is it that hard to say, “I stole it to eavesdrop on them?” “I was hoping you wouldn’t ask me about that.”

Yes, Kira! Be something other than a resistance fighter! Or maybe don’t because I feel like that attitude is going to last about three seconds. (Future editing me says “No kidding.” But Odo is adorable when he says something akin to “We should really find a quiet place to discuss the new revolution, then.”)

The hotel metaphor is creepy, sad, and very well done. As was the brief conversation when the prisoners exchanged places.

Julian is so disgusted by the Vorta. And I feel it.  Garak: “Correction: humans have rules in war. Rules that tend to make victory a little harder to achieve, in my opinion.” - that just felt super notable to me but then again, I seriously support the aforementioned rules. 

The Vedec situation stunned me. I don’t honestly know what else to say about it. Like I said before, this show constantly manages to surprise me. I read the trivia for the episode on Amazon and it said that Sisko and Kira are supposed to be having parallel story arcs here but I’m not seeing it. If anyone gets that, can you explain?

Also, I was absolutely cheering when Sisko told Dax he hopes there’s another way and planned to find one. That gives me new hope for Sisko and makes me absurdly happy. ANNND of course it didn’t work out but he was MAD it didn’t work out and I am so happy about that. Sisko is trying to chose mercy.

I have come to the realization I’m not going to see the end of this story arc tonight, so we’re going to call it here. 6.1 was better than 6.2 imo (which you can tell because I didn’t write as I watched and now I’m missing details I wanted to talk about!). In 6.2 Jake is kind of an asshole and the whole episode it a little darker except Miles ripped his pants. I think 6.1 did a better job breaking it up and inserting wins and optimism in between loss after loss. This episode ends with Sisko senselessly killing ten men he didn’t want to kill. I’m usually not a fan of long story arcs like this, and tend to prefer stand-alone episodes (I think the same about shows like Doctor Who) but I was absolutely wrapped into this today. I’m just having trouble keeping the characters straight. Are we going to lose Dax, guys? Or at least Jadzia?

From my understanding, those Borg come from the Next Generation movie First Contact where the Borg go back in time to try to stop Humanity from achieving warp technology. 
Now this all sounds great in theory until you you take in the fact that the Kelvin timeline exists. Let me explain.
In theory, the timeline remains the same until the Romulan goes back in time and alters it. Going on this hypothesis, the NX-01 Enterprise would exist in both timelines and everything that happens in it journey also exists. Including the Borg incident. 
Now, the paradox here is that the STNG events would not play out the same in the Kelvin universe meaning the events of First Contact would not play out, which creates a paradox of the kelvin timeline relying on the events of the prime timeline to affect it. 
So basically the timeline would loop back on itself multiple times and shouldn't really exist. 
The timeline would go until the events of first contact which would create the events of Regeneration. Then the timeline would continue from there until the Hobus event and the creation of the Kelvin timeline, but since the Kelvin timeline is a new reality, it shouldn't have the events of First Contact.

Tuvok or EMH is my favourite. I do like Janeway (maybe more than Archer) but I still say she is far behind the holy trinity of Kirk/Picard/Sisco.

I think Disco itself is fine. It is a product of the era it is being made in, the same as TOS, TNG, etc. I'm not quite sure I get the hate for S1, yes S2 is better (mostly). There are some weak episodes in both seasons, but what show doesn't have the occasional clunker? The ""save/find Tilly"" episodes stand out as particularly bad, and the end of S2 E13 where everyone's running around telling everyone else and their families goodbye. One or two of that would have  been fine, but by the time it got to half the crew, I was looking for the fast forward button.

CBS All-Access. Ugh. I'm glad I can pay month to month, but I'm done with it. The $5.99/month has sooooo many ads in it, at least twice as many as Hulu - and it is the same ads over and over and over.  I counted at least 5 breaks in the season finale last night, and each one was 5-6 ads of 30 sec duration. That's 15 extra minutes. And the breaks were not well selected, at least two were in the middle of battle sequences. I guess I can just bump up to the ad-free version.

7,How Star Trek influenced my life and family for the better.,1593017448,"I originally planned this as a comment on a post, but as you see, it got a little out of hand. 

I have a long family-oriented history with Star Trek: The Next Generation. I watched them as they came out with my dad, and it became a favorite of mine immediately. As it was one of the only shows my dad would allow us kids to watch during dinner, I enjoyed it immediately. But the stories and characters are what really made me love it and helped shaped me into the awesome nerd that I am today. My dad and I would record them all on VHS tapes and we could fit up to 3 episodes on a tape, so we’d often rewatch groups of episodes at a time during summer reruns. Well as it usually happens, I got older (and more into sex, drugs, and rock and roll) and stopped watching DS9 and Voyager with him and eventually moved out, but we would always make the time to still go see the Next Generation movies together as they came out. 

15-20 some years later, he was dying from Alzheimer’s and quickly losing his mental faculties. One of our last times together in which he was still mentally aware, we watched Inner Light and the final two Next Generation episodes on our old VHS tapes. It was hard to find the right cords for the VCR, to get everything to work together, and it was a pain remembering how to do the “tracking” on it so the picture wasn’t awful. But we got it up and running. And enjoyed the 3 episodes together. When he passed away a few months later, I cried a bit at his actual funeral, but after that, I never really became emotional or really reflected on what occurred. I honestly believed that was all the mourning I was going to do, and moved on as best as I could. 

Almost 2 years later, Netflix got all of the Star Treks and I decided I’d watch them all again/for the first time (I’d never even seen one episode of Enterprise). I would sometimes watch the episodes on my breaks at work or during my lunches. So, one day I decided to take an extra long lunch so I could finish the two parter series finale of Next Generation. I got done with it in my cubicle at work and as I saw Captain Picard join the senior staff in some poker, my eyes started to well up with tears. Within seconds of the final credits starting, I was in full force, ugly crying all over my cubicle. The whole snotty nose, choked up sounding, red-faced ugly crying.  My current fiancé, then gf, worked a decent distance away from my cubicle and ran over when she heard my awful, banshee-like sobbing noises from 30 some odd feet away. When she finally reached my cubicle, a small group had started to linger near my cubicle’s intersection. After shooing them away and she asked me, “Oh my god, Dydarian, what’s wrong?!?”. I looked at her with my already red-rimmed eyes, tears streaming from my face, and choked out the words, “I just finished the last episode of The Next Generation and he’s never coming back!”, and started loudly sobbing uncontrollably again. 

My daughter is now 8 and I thought it would be a great time for her to start Next Generation. I didn’t think she’d be into it, so I told her that our “no tv while eating” rule could be ignored if we watched Next Generation. I was wrong though, as she absolutely adores it. So now my daughter always asks me if we can watch Star Trek while we eat dinner, and I’m beyond happy to let her. I love that I can continue this tradition with her, and hope to one day make her ugly cry in a cubicle while watching Star Trek.

20,“Wink Of An Eye” - First Time Viewing Reaction,1593000643,"Noob Trek 66 - The Wink Of An Eye

An unusual one. For the first ten minutes I was prepared to not like this - I received a bad impression immediately from the crappy backdrop and nasty looking set used for Scalos. The premises thrown at us such as the disappearing crewman and the malfunctioning Enterprise were potentially interesting - I found myself anticipating an episode we did not get, one in which the Enterprise breaks down. I thought it would be interesting to see what becomes of Kirk once his prized and mighty starship is reduced to a clapped old banger that can‘t go five yards without something falling off or exploding. I came to this conclusion because the alien presence aboard initially seemed to be a poltergeist or gremlins messing the ship’s workings up. (I half expected Shatner to look out a viewport and see a creature on the side of the spaceship ripping things up, they could have done “Nightmare At 20000 Light Years”.)

However, you might notice I called this opening material before the plot really starts “potentially” interesting. Something was off - people were winking out of existence, there was a ghost city with no population, the Enterprise is falling apart, and no one particularly seemed to care, there was little sense of urgency or drama. I began to feel bored and quipped ”More like forty winks of the eye, etc.”  But this may in fact be accidental genius on the show’s part - I felt the show was too \*slow\* and my interest picked up as soon as Kirk drank the coffee and accelerated, the pace of the episode matches this shift. It wasn't until Kirk sips his coffee and we began to get some highly unusual, trippy camera work that I said to myself “Hang on, what’s happening here?”

And then Kathie Browne makes the scene as Deela. She may be the most important guest star yet. We’ve seen critical guest turns before, such as William Campbell in Squire Of Gothos, but even in the case of Squire I think the script was good enough that it would have worked with a lesser actor. This episode though I think would be a dumpster fire if Browne had been incompetently cast. (We may have in fact seen this happen in The Alternative Factor, in which Robert Brown’s shockingly bad performance was the nail in the coffin.) Why am I giving such importance to Browne? Because this episode is largely her and Kirk standing around talking to each other, and Kirk is a known quantity here. He wants to escape and free his crew and ship. It’s up to Browne to carry the episode by making all this dialogue tolerable by adding colour and intrigue, projecting an engaging air of mystery and almost single-handedly representing the alien culture which is the focus of this story.

It’s a difficult role too - though initially she seems to be a ludicrous “hello random space man I am horny for you” analogue to Natira in For This Romance Is Hollow And I Wrote It While I Was High a few episodes back, Deela turns out to be a complex and ambitious character. She’s simultaneously sympathetic and unsympathetic, both villain and love interest. Her performance is excellent, smoothly cycling between threatening, flirtatious, domineering, childlike, playful, cruel, yet presenting a cohesive character that informs us of so much of the attitudes and ways of her people. See also her rather adult and sensitively handled relationship with Rael - they’re a couple, but Rael is impotent, and he has to stand by silently while his lover makes babies with another man. (Kirk pulls on his boots at the end of the bedroom scene while she tidies herself up, there’s little doubt what they were doing. It’s a bit of a saucy episode too, with dialogue amounting to Deela saying she needs the male crew’s seed, her raunchy outfit with one side bare except for floral panties, and quite a bit of passionate kissing.) The moment Deela says “sorry” to Rael after the fight is strangely touching. Deela almost reminds me of Titania, a sci-fi take on the fairy queen who toys with mortals and lures them to her dimension of delights and their doom to the annoyance of her husband Oberon. To a great extent, Browne makes the episode. Without her lighting up the screen, this might have been a bit grim.

That isn’t because the other elements of the episode are bad, it’s because there’s not a lot to them. The subplot with Spock working on a cure is fairly perfunctory and doesn’t inspire a lot of writing. Compton’s death stands out as a chilling moment, and an example of how this episode does something right by “showing” rather than telling the plot. We can infer the nature of things by Deela’s dialogue and character and things we see, we don’t need a “Kirk and Spock explain the story” scene this time. Another interesting thing is the camera work - this episode is continuously shot on angle, perhaps suggesting the skewed, uncanny nature of the accelerated time stream.

Deela’s reaction to losing suggests that has all been a merry game to her, bringing back the fairy queen analogy. The ending is a bit too ambiguous for my taste though. Is Deela pregnant with Kirk’s child? Would that even matter? Are they just going to die out? Is Kirk condemning them to death because they are too dangerous? It’s not very clear. He also seems amused rather than appropriately affected by the situation and I felt a lack of culture.

But I have to say, I liked this more than I thought I did. Maybe as with The Tholian Web, the plot doesn’t stand up to close inspection, but it’s a character and acting focussed episode and does very well in those areas. A more sedate story that works because of some unusual ideas and a radiant guest star.",startrek,Kayfim20,False,/r/startrek/comments/hezwr4/wink_of_an_eye_first_time_viewing_reaction/
21,I just finished watching The Next Generation for the first time after putting it off for way too long. I finally understand why it is a fan favourite. These are my thoughts and feelings. Some spoilers inside.,1593000422,"(Note: I realise the season finale is two episodes, but Netflix has them as one long episode so I'll be referring to it as such throughout this post)

&amp;#x200B;

For the longest time, Voyager was the only Star Trek I'd watched. It was a big part of my childhood. I loved it to pieces. I dunno why it took me so long to watch TNG (I'll be watching DS9 next too) but boy am I glad I finally got around to it. That was an extraordinary experience. I'm sad it's over (well, mostly over, I still have the movies to watch), but at the same time, I feel satisfied. The ending was perfect and a very clever tie-in to the first episode. It sort of ... wraps the whole thing up nicely.

&amp;#x200B;

Q played a much more pivotal role in the whole series than I'd expected. He's easily one of my favourite characters, with some of his episodes being some of my favourites as well. He's one of the biggest reasons the whole show has such a strong sense of continuity. And as goofy and chaotic as he is, he also teaches some of the most important and valuable lessons. And with the final episode linking all the way back to the first, it gives a sense of closure, of finality. It comes full circle and gives us a chance to reflect on everything that has happened.

&amp;#x200B;

The past sequences give us a strong frame of reference of how it used to be, to better showcase just how far we've come. We see Data inquiring about human expressions, something he hadn't needed to do for quite a while in the present. That shows how much he's developed on his quest to become more human. We see everyone with their different ranks and positions on the ship, like how Picard forgets that Worf isn't chief of security in this time. Everyone is a stranger and unaware of the friendships they are about to forge. And we get to see Tasha Yar, alive and well one last time. Her character deserved better imo.

&amp;#x200B;

As for the future, everyone is separated. Worf and Riker are disillusioned. Beverly and Picard had married but then separated. It appeared as though no one had any substantial contact with each other for a long time. This almost feels ... dystopian. It shows how important it is to hold on to those bonds they've forged. To not let it all fall apart, to not let friends become enemies. Picard clearly takes this lesson to heart at the end of the episode, when he finally joins his officers, his friends, for a card game they've all been playing for years, that Picard himself states he wishes he'd joined in on. He clearly holds them all very dear, and doesn't want his actual future to turn out the way it appeared throughout the duration of the episode.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, a perfect ending to a perfect show. I still have the movies to look forward to as well, once I somehow get access to them (why do you have all the shows but not the movies, Netflix?!), but if they'd never existed, I wouldn't be upset. The show is perfect as it is, and I'm satisfied with how it ended. I'll always love Voyager of course, but I think I might have a new favourite Star Trek...

24,Random thoughts on TOS and Discovery from a new fan,1592995827,"So a few weeks ago, I was at home because the whole damn world was at home, and I'd run out of Eighth Doctor radio dramas on Spotify and wanted some new sci-fi, and thought ""y'know what, this Star Trek thing seems to be a big deal, might as well try that.""

Since then I've watched both seasons of Discovery and the first season of TOS, and goddamn do I love these shows. I've always been a huge Doctor Who fan, and Star Trek has the same vibe of heroes who go around helping people and exploring and finding out weird things that are going on, and I just really love it.

I've seen that a lot of people don't seem to like Discovery for being too dark, and while it is noticeably darker than TOS, from where I'm standing I don't see it as an issue. Discovery at its core has the same optimistic, forward-looking beliefs as TOS, its just set in a time and place where those beliefs are more in conflict with what's going on around the characters. I think Saru and Tilly are the characters who bring this across best, but yeah - for someone who's used to the dominant tone of modern sci-fi being dystopian and military, I found scenes like Saru's response to Voq begging to be executed, or the end of New Eden, to be really refreshing. I'm so hyped for Season 3, the idea of the Disco crew now being basically good guy versions of the Remnant faction from The Mandalorian (a series that, as much as I like it, is about as dark, gritty and mean as modern sci-fi gets) seems really interesting to me.

The Original Series is so good as well! I'm a big fan of classic sci-fi, so the somewhat dated appearance of it isn't really an issue for me, and yes there's moments where you can *really* tell it's a show from the 60s, but its still an awful lot of fun and I really enjoy the overall ""vibe"" of the thing.

Personally, I would like a mirrorverse show set around the voy/ds9 time (maybe slightly later) . Have a terrain ship (with a couple of 'outcasts' from the other species to mix it up) exploring the political state of the mirrorverse.

Nog uses every advantage, tending to overstep at times. When Sisko asks Nog for some names of Red Squad members, Cadet Nog had the gall to decline Captain Sisko’s request to his face because he didn’t want to risk getting blacklisted from Red Squad—prompting a stern dressing-down by Sisko.

36,Finished Picard season 1 a while ago. My thoughts.,1592968586,"TL;DR

* I don't love it or hate it.
* Characters weren't all that interesting.
* Has some actually interesting moments.
* Ending was the perfect sendoff for Data (Possible assisted suicide subtext notwithstanding)
* Unsure where it'll go from here. Still got hope.

So... Picard... Much maligned by the fanbase. Where do I stand? ...meh. I knew it would be different. I guess I wan't ready for just how different. Honestly, they should've left the experimental stuff to Discovery and tried to be more traditional. But what we got was... okay. There were some diamonds in the rough, sure, but on the whole I think it was kinda weak.

I loved the aesthetic, blending the modern idea of futuristic with familiar trek trappings was very much enjoyable for me. I do think that getting a closer look at the civilian side of things has potential. That being said, this show has a significantly different feel, one that I don't really think will stick in the long term. The characters... well... I wasn't as drawn in as I was with Discovery. I'm sure I'll learn them better as I see more of them, but for now, there's not a whole lot here. That being said, I enjoyed how they played Doctor Agnes' double agent status. Not often you see that kind of portrayal  and it was refreshing to see. Also, Elnor was just plain fun to watch. The philosophy of absolute candor makes for some really entertaining moments. Plus he's a fricking Romulan samurai. It's absurd in the best ways possible.

One thing I really liked was the sendoff they gave Data. His request for finality reminded me of TNG's Time's Arrow and felt very fitting for his character. I'll miss him, sure, but I get why they did it.  There is a slight gripe with it, though. In hindsight, there is a subtext of assisted suicide. Likely unintentional, but I find it hard to ignore. Also, another scene that comes to mind for entertaining scenes is Raffi talking with each of the holograms to figure out what Rios was hiding. Very fun, very trek.

Lastly, the Zhat Vash. I don't hate their existence. It's not too outlandish to me (Romulans and secrets are joined at the hip, after all) and they do their job as antagonists. I don't find them engrosingly interesting, but they're serviceable.

In the end, Picard was a show that was taking a chance. And in many ways, it fell flat. Where the show goes from here, I can only imagine. Hopefully there's a little more Starfleet to be seen going forward. I won't write the series off just yet. There's still potential. Just not so much in season 1. 

Meanwhile Discovery season 3 is around the corner and it's shaping up to be really interesting. I can see a lot of fans foaming at the mouth at the thought of the Federation's collapse, but I think there are good stories there. Granted I really do wish Strange New Worlds helps supplement this with good ol' fashion trek.

39,Perspective on New Trek,1592968346,"The fandom is torn with conflicting opinions about the Abrams films, Discovery and Picard. This isn’t new. I’ve seen the fandom evolve now for several years and I wanted to share an anecdote that I hope will provide some understanding or maybe open a dialogue about this subject.  

I grew up with my dad watching TOS. We were big fans and he introduced me to other wonderful sci-fi stuff like Dr. Who. I have fond memories of falling asleep on the couch watching TV with my dad.  

The Next Generation launched when I was 9 and my dad was 45. 

TNG divided the fan base back then, too. Some older fans hated it, hated the direction it was taking the series. My dad fell right into this age category. He’d been watching Trek on reruns since ‘69, buying books, going to conventions. He was invested. Had he decided he could have joined with those who hated this new Trek.  

But he didn’t.  

He stayed with the series through a shaky first season and all the criticism. He stayed with it and as a result I got to grow up on TNG which is one of the most important pieces of media in my life. I went from being a childhood fan to an adult, able to appreciate the deeper themes of both series. His choice to allow Trek to experiment and grow allowed me to grow with it.  

I know there are valid complaints about some aspects of New Trek. I know some of those choices turn people off, just like how Deep Space 9 alienated some fans, like Voyager did, like Enterprise did. Every time a new version of Trek is released there will always be fans who choose to complain. I’m not questioning the validity of the complaints, nor am I demanding that everyone must be a fan of the newer series.  

What I am asking for is, even if you don’t care for it, to allow Trek to stumble and grow. To give it room to try new things and to understand that even if it’s not your cup of tea, this Trek may be the thing that brings in a new fan or becomes the most important piece of media of someone’s life.  Take each bit of Trek on its own merits.

It’s okay to dislike something, but maybe we can find a place in that dislike and discomfort to agree that there can be good ideas and meaningful themes even in what we do not like.  

There’s criticism and then there’s outright destruction that comes from a place of anger. Just because you don’t care for something doesn’t mean everyone will share your point of view. Liking new Trek doesn’t mean someone is immediately incorrect or must be argued into your viewpoint. Give people room to like what they like and talk about without trying to shred them.

41,Long Time Star Trek Fan Finally Watches DS9: Season 5 episodes 22-24,1592965959,"Children of Time: 

“Time is their enemy. We should help them defeat it.” This made me so happy. 

Fake Odo made what I would consider a very out of character decision here. That said, did they kill those people? Or did they just chose a different set of people who are going to live now? I’d love to hear everyone’s thoughts on this. Traditionally, I might agree with the needs of the many mentality. But in this case, I think the only life lost would have been Kira’s. By choosing to crash, they were just choosing the lives in front of them. So I think Fake Odo made the right decision in general, but not the right decision for himself. I also think he might have ruined any chance that Kira would fall in love with real Odo, because she had never been able to separate the alternate people/outcomes/choices from the ones that actually happen. She has trouble shifting, which we saw in her last episode where she barely made it to sit with Fake Dad because she didn’t want to separate his teenage actions from the person he is now (and to be fair, her perspective is a legitimate viewpoint in transitional justice- is a teenager who commits war crimes while following orders responsible for those actions? To what extent? That’s a bit of an oversimplification, but you get the point). To her, Odo really did make this decision. 

That said, I don’t think it was fair for the bridge crew to make this PARTICULAR decision for the crew. I know that’s their job description, but each and every crew member had a life back on the station, on Bajor, possibly elsewhere. And while they risk those lives every day, and accept that risk, this time, they didn’t have to. They could have said no.

I really want to hear everybody’s thoughts on the decisions each character made in this episode!

Blaze of Glory: is what’s his name actually dead? I’m so bad with names. EDINGTON (thanks future proofreading self) I didn’t want him to die per say, but I wouldn’t mind him being sent to a Federation prison after a fair trial and staying there. I agree 100% with his analysis that Sisko made bad decisions because it was too personal for him. I get that he feels betrayed in the most fundamental sense. This is a man he had in his home. And the other dude (the old dude from the episode where Sisko tries to give him back his uniform) was someone he looked up to. Sisko can’t take this sensation. Same as always, I love Sisko’s newfound conviction but I don’t like the decisions he makes.

Empok Nor: I LOVED this episode. It felt like a horror movie. But in such a great way. I jumped out of my skin when the first Cardassian attacked. Garak’s acting was beautiful, as always. It was so exciting. So skin crawling. The way he hung the dead bodies was so creepy. You guys said the Keiko’s body being taken over episode was the O’Brien gets tortured episode. I disagree. This was way worse. I vividly remember him crying over Muniz (and me crying over Muniz). And the scene with Worf helping him scare away the predators! So I can just imagine how awful he feels when his entire mission crew is killed (except Nog). I do wonder why Garak said, “Oh yeah this is a biogenic compound. Guess I’ll leave it here on my hand.” When Garak stabbed that officer, I was just totally wrapped into the scene. But I also loved the resolution to this, where O’Brien is an engineer, not a soldier. That was a beautiful message to me. I thought it was interesting how Garak kept pressing Miles on the subject of his military conquests, particularly that one Cardassian battle. I always thought Miles joined DS9 to leave that behind. Which I guess is why Garak was interested in pressing him on it. I just love the person Miles was in this episode. I also loved how forgiving he was when Julian removed the psychoactive compound from Garak’s system. Despite the horrible, horrible things Garak did on that station, Miles walks in there and accepts his apology for the dead man’s wife. I personally have a lot to learn about forgiveness, and it helps me to see it in action like this.

But in the hellish nebula known as the Pergamum, the stalwart commander instead finds an epic battle of his own, pitting ancient enemies against one another – with not just the Enterprise, but her crew as the spoils of war.

I'm getting my partner into Star Trek. I wanted to know what people think of the below ""head-canon"" re-watch?   I think the below episodes do build into a loose continuity as well as focus the most on the internal affairs of the Federation.  I'm wondering what everyone thinks of this list? We've also been going through the story in Star Trek Online.

I skipped Enterprise because I feel it's better to circle around to : To provide more of an explanation of some of the concepts brought up in the later series. Discovery I haven't seen yet as I'm waiting for the series to be complete. 

Voyager, I left off the list as I find it doesn't really add to a ""**Story of the Federation**"" As much as the others do, it does have some good moments, but could be hived off separately.  I much prefer the internal dramas of the Federation to the external stories / scientific stories.

I built the below list from a list of episodes and their star dates.  ([http://startreklist.blogspot.com/2011/04/list-of-all-star-trek-episodes-sorted\_05.html](http://startreklist.blogspot.com/2011/04/list-of-all-star-trek-episodes-sorted_05.html))

I am a big fan of schematics in general and of Star Trek ships in specific.

When it comes to the ships I am very fond of the smaller ones and the ones that have a more limited, but more interesting roles to fulfill. I am a Game Master for Star Trek Adventures and prefer to have my players in the smaller ships as it makes for better story telling in my opinion.    

Having deck plans makes it a lot more immersive for players and for me, having a specific room to point to is a great tool. The ones on the Cygnus 1-x website made by Strategic Design are awesome. Sadly one of the ones I would very much like is missing. The Saber Class.   

I was going to use the icons they use in their designs to make my own version of the Saber class based on the information on the acalltoduty website.    

Now I feel that I might be able to cut and paste, I very much doubt I will be able to create convincing outlines of the deckplans of the Saber class. We all have our limitations.    

So my ask is the following: Does anyone have existing deckplans of the quality of Strategic Design? Or if not can anyone help me create them by providing slices of the Saber class?

81,Give JJ a break,1592925495,"Look, I get it. Kelvin Trek is high-throttle pop to Star Trek's classical music. But I was 15 when the reboot came out, and classical music was boring. 

Bureaucracy and muddled politics on a space station? Pass. Forehead-of-the-week production value? Psych! Captain reciting treaty language to Sheliak Corporate? Hard sell. 

JJ Abrams opened a door to a world that at passing glance, I found bland and bereft of excitement. As a vapid teenager I couldn't care less about the intricacies of interstellar politics. I found Transformers exciting. I didn't know Kirk or any of the Trek lore, but because of that movie I became eager to dig into what the differences were between this cool movie and the series it was based on. Unearthing that whole zeitgeist was an endeavor I came to love over the past decade. 

I might never have given much thought to the world of nuanced television I now enjoy so much if it weren't for those 2009 lens flares. I'm disappointed when I see all the hate that movie gets, because I hold a special place in my heart for what it did for me. I'm living proof that it accomplished the broadening of audience it set out to accomplish, and I think that's what should be celebrated. 

Maybe those movies aren't really Star Trek, maybe their plots are half-chewed rehashes, and maybe they don't develop their characters in the same way a series can. Evidently there isn't much thematic overlap between the Prime and Kelvin timelines, but I don't hold any grudges for it. 

Although I don't find shoot-em-ups as engaging nowadays, I will always appreciate the stepping stone that Star Trek 2009 created for me.

In TNG, we start with the weird bodysuits, which then switched to the two piece uniform in Season 3. That’s fine, I understand that. 

Then in DS9, we see them wear a brand new Jumpsuit/overalls. It’s never outright said, at least I don’t think it is, but I assume that this uniform is supposed to be worn by starbase personnel, and the other two piece uniform (TNG) is supposed to be worn by starship personnel. A bit weird, but I guess they make the rules so whatever. 

Then Voyager comes along, and gives those rules the five knuckle shuffle, by having starship personnel wear the Jumpsuit uniform. What the hell is going on here? Is Janeway allergic to following uniform regulations? Did the regulations kill her parents and leave her scared and bitter towards rules? I don’t get it.

2,Dixon Hill fans? Anyone?,1592888626,"So, I have watched all of TNG, at least once. Many episodes I've seen mutliple times. And I remembered Picard had a fancy for Dixon Hill noir crime drama in the Holodeck. 

But I didn't realize how much I liked Dixon Hill! I just watched Big Goodbye and it was freaking fun. I usually don't like the stupid ""zomg we're trapped in the Holodeck and the safeties are off"" episodes because they're done a lot. I didn't like any of the Captain Proton stuff in VOY. But I really enjoyed Patrick Stewart as Dixon Hill and all this. I honestly didn't remember liking this stuff when I watched all of TNG. I'm glad I stumbled back across it. Thanks quarantine!

I'm disappointed they did so little with it. I think he only appears in two other episodes and they're not full Dixon Hill stories, but rather little side things that happen at the beginning before the real story starts. And then of course the short bit in FC.

I dunno. I just really like this stupid, silly, cheesey stuff like that. Y'all ever seen that episode The Royale? Yeah, kinda like that.

3,Symbiosis in TNG was not a Reaganite “anti-drug” episode,1592887448,"I’ve heard some people criticizing “Symbiosis” in TNG for parroting Reagan era anti-drug points but I don’t get that argument. It seems to be more a statement about exploitation and imperialism: the situation is reminiscent of when Britain got China addicted to opium causing the Opium Wars. It’s one country living off the spoils looted from another country, which most of Western Europe was doing for centuries (or still doing if you agree with the neocolonialism argument). Indeed, even the much maligned discussion between Tasha and Wesley was not the Reaganite “just say no” demonization of drug users: instead she stressed the point that drug users turn to drugs because of poverty, inequality, and violence. This has always been the left wing response to anti drug conservatism: not that drugs are fine and not addictive but that criminalizing drug use is not the correct approach because the roots of drug use lie in other social issues like poverty and racism that need to be addressed. I just think this episode has gotten too much hate from people who claim it represents the anti drug suburban fervor of the 1980s when it really doesn’t at all.",startrek,Afternoonsin,False,/r/startrek/comments/he858t/symbiosis_in_tng_was_not_a_reaganite_antidrug/

12,Just completed TNG for the first time.,1592879607,"Hello. About a year ago I started to get into Star Trek on netflix. I started with the original series and the Kirk movies, had a blast and then went into TNG. Thanks to a global pandemic I got the time to finish the series. Already posted my thoughts on those so I guess I wanted to rant about TNG.

Holy crap it was good! Unsurprisingly its like TOS but bigger and better. Its a marked improvement on most areas. That said, it was actually a little harder to get into compared to the the original series. I knew the first two seasons of TNG were considered weaker but it was still a little hard to start. The TOS' flaws were (to me) easier to forgive since it was so campy and silly. It rarely took itself seriously so it was easy to forgive. TNG's first few seasons were kinda dry. Minus the Q stuff it wasn't as fun as its predecessor. It kinda had an educational magic treehouse feel to it especially in the Wesley centric stuff.

Season 4 onward is fantastic. My favorite episodes was ""Drumhead"", ""Lower Decks"", ""Relics"", ""Tapestry"", ""Inner Light"", ""Best of Both Worlds"", and ""all good things"" I also really liked ""Second Chances"" with the Riker doppelganger being an identical twin myself kinda identified the struggles and jealousy.

It was rewarding (while unnecessary) to watch TOS first. Spock and McCoy's appearances were nice but despite those two being my favorite characters in TOS surprisingly to me Scotty had the best guest appearance with the ""Relics"" Piccard and Scotty talking on the set of the original Enterprise actually really got to me. Also when Q showed up I immediately thought of Trelane and upon some research apparently they're the same species.

TNG toning down the god-like entities from TOS  was a relief to me (Kirk ran into and defeated gods like beings every other week like Apollo, Trelane, Gary Mitchell and more) Q was surprisingly one of my favorite characters. Cool to see him last the whole series Patrick Stewart was great as Picard. I also liked Riker, Guinan, and Data.

I totally get why the [Worf Effect](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect) is called what it is though. Dear lord

14,Long Time Star Trek Fan Finally Watches DS9: season 5 episodes 17-21,1592875184,"Usually when I watch this many episodes I condense my thoughts at the end instead of writing out throughout each episode. But I wrote all of these out. So this is really long. Stick with me!


A Simple Investigation: 
Before we get too far into this episode, I don’t trust this woman even slightly but I’m STILL going to feel bad when she breaks Odo’s heart.

I love episodes like this, where a character has an equal match. Odo has a good mental adversary. “Why not help you?” I love that attitude. Protective custody... sure... THAT’S why. 

The one problem I have with this episode is that we don’t need another shady group of people doing shady things on a regular basis. The Orion Syndicate, the Dominion, the Maquis, the entire Klingon Empire, the Founders (if you separate them from the Dominion), I think I’m forgetting some: we have so, so many on DS9. 

Odo’s skin tone on his body just doesn’t *quite* match his makeup. Just a thought. 

Worf is STILL A JERK TO JADZIA. I thought we’d been through this. 

Okay I wasn’t even that heartbroken until she said she was married. Now I’m a little heartbroken. 

My thoughts on this episode were a little sporadic and anecdotal. But are we EVER GOING TO LET ODO BE HAPPY? That’s become a cliche in these posts, like being heartbroken, not liking Sisko/the Ferengi and loving Julian. You guys don’t want to hear it anymore. Let Odo be happy!

Business as Usual: I liked Sisko’s “nail you to the wall” speech to Quark. I’m slowly starting to like Sisko. I disagree with some (or a lot) of his major command decisions, especially when he commands the defiant. But at the same time I like his hard, not taking any crap attitude. I like that there are consequences for character actions. 

Jadzia’s disappointment in Quark is beautiful. And she plays it very well. I think it’s funny that of all people, Quark wanted Jadzia to forgive him. Not Odo? I also kept waiting for Julian to take over looking after Kiroyoshi and magically calm him down but then it was Worf!

“What I’m trying to say is... keeping Kiroyoshi in the pit is not an acceptable solution. Find another one.”

Ties of Blood and Water:
When Kira’s real dad said that he made a mistake by trying to reason and talk with the Cardassians, and look where it got him, I nearly burst into tears. Because that right there explains almost all of Kira’s character. She wants to have that kind, peaceful heart, and it’s in her somewhere, but she doesn’t trust conversation. She came from a world where kindness, peace, and mercy were punished. This is the first time I feel like I personally understood Kira. I mean I always knew these things empirically but I actually UNDERSTAND it now. Oh, my god they burnt his garden and now I actually AM crying. Guys season 5 is killing me, my roommates must think I’m having a mental breakdown. Oh GOD WHY would you tell her he died calling her name??! Oh my god they buried him next to Kira’s real dad. He would be so proud that she wasn’t killing Cardassians on sight, that she was changing and forgiving.

But in the name of actual discussion, I will stop whimpering and actually come up with coherent thoughts. Odo was probably my favorite role in this episode. He doesn’t push like Julian does, and this is the Odo I missed from season two. The Odo that read fake dad’s service record and sees a teenager who did what every other teenager did at the time, who followed orders when they got there, who changed and regrets their decisions. Fake dad did good things for Kira. And Odo is willing to acknowledge and appreciate that personal evolution. Julian, as he does, cares more radically. Yes, this is a bad person but all people deserve care and kindness in the end and you should be there. He’s pushy about it, which is not what she needed (I think Odo was a better influence on her- gently encouraging her to reach her own conclusion based on the person she is now, not then- she was so consumed by vengeance that she did a bad thing and she shouldn’t make the same mistake) but he was a good listener in that last scene. I did keep waiting for Julian to reach out and touch her, be reassuring, but he just listened. Maybe that was best. I don’t know. I liked this episode, don’t get me wrong because of all the crying. It was good crying. I got to remember some important things myself.

But seriously, please, ANY lighthearted episodes coming up? Anything?

Ferengi Love Songs: Before I even start the episode, I wanted to say that I was actually excited for a Ferengi episode because it’ll be a bit of a comedic break, right? But then I read the description: “Quark sacrifices his mother’s happiness in order to regain his standing in Ferengi society.” Does he have to be THAT much of an asshole?? I try not to curse in these posts but really?

Rom is so, so sweet with Lita. That makes me so happy. He treats her so well! 
5 minutes later: Oh, just kidding.

Okay how am I supposed to take this species seriously when Quark’s bedroom looks like an episode of Blue’s Clues?

I laughed so hard when Sisko found Rom crying through is work. His body language just screams, “You know what this is? Not my problem.” Which is the same sentiment reflected by Kira talking to Lita a few seconds later. It was hysterical. 
“I hate him.”
“No you don’t.”
“All he cares about is profit.”
“No he doesn’t.” Etc. 

This turned out a little more cliche than I tend to expect from DS9 but it made me happy so I’m not complaining. I think there was a joke with the whole “Brunt in the closet” situation but it really just made me think of hobbits. 

Soldiers of the Empire: hey, Levar Burton directed this! 

It takes days to get the blood out of the carpet. 

Hey, for those of you who made it in this deep, does Worf outrank Jadzia at this point? Or is he just technically on command station and therefore takes over command before she would because she should be on a panel instead? I absolutely love that Kira assigns duties to EVERYONE on the station, not just the Bajorans. It makes things feel a little more cohesive. I also loved Jadzia stepping on the ship without telling Worf. Too bad Kira’s going to have to reassign her part of Worf’s duties. I love how Dax flows right into Klingon culture. They know her and take her in. She knows their songs and customs. It’s so much fun to watch how she doesn’t seem even remotely out of place. If any of you want to show off and translate the songs I’m all ears!

I’m so happy that Worf has a new Klingon house to be a part of. I’ll be honest with Y’all I never totally understood the sash. I always assumed it was a traditional thing but I don’t recall seeing other Klingons wear it or anything resembling it with other armor. 

This was a fun episode. I really enjoyed it. Although I have gotten the sense that Klingons on DS9 are sort of a controversial topic? I have really liked most of the Klingon episodes so far.

That Picard never had a brush with death, never came face to face with his own mortality, never realized how fragile life is, or how important each moment must be. So his life never came into focus. He drifted through much of his career, with no plan or agenda… going from one assignment to the next, never seizing the opportunities that presented themselves. He never led the away-team on Milika III to save the ambassador, or take charge of the Stargazer's bridge when its captain was killed. And no one ever offered him a command. He learned to play it safe… and he never, ever got noticed by anyone.""

There isn't a single quote in film or TV history that gives me chills as much as this one does. No matter how many times I see it, it always gets me. Many, many years ago, I was going to drop out of college and end my life. There was this Trek MeetUp group that I kept cancelling on. I was invited at least seven times and never went. I couldn't drag my ass out of bed. Finally, one day - one of my worst - I threw Tapestry on and something about this quote gave me this urge to finally go to one of these. I was a miserable sack of shit but I managed to get out of bed and go. At least four times on my way there, I was trying to think of reasons to turn around and go back home. 

That's when I met my wife. Just about the craziest, most passionate bubbly person with a world of knowledge - and not just about Trek. We hit it off immediately. We chatted online for a bit and then she decided to ask me out on a formal date. A dinner and a movie. Said movie was the 2009 Trek which I did not want to see at all. It looked too flashy and didn't resemble Trek at all. I was bawling my eyes out in the first ten fucking minutes of that movie right in front of this girl I was trying to impress. Hence my username. I'm not some crazy JJ fan but man do I owe him for that night. Tapestry and 2009 somehow led me to my wife who kicked my ass and made me finish college. I'm a senior animator now; I love my job and we have two amazing kids. 

That Tapestry quote still gets me (as do those first ten minutes of 2009 and I adore that movie in general) and I often wonder what my life would've been like if I hadn't watched that episode that night and if it didn't inspire me to *try* and go to an event I desperately tried to avoid. It was my greatest lesson and I owe it a great deal. My wife also told me that she wasn't sure about me at first because I was a bit of an arrogant know-it-all who kept ranting about JJ and how this movie would suck. She changed her mind when she saw me cry. 

You ever had one of those days where when you look back, you see it as this massive cornerstone of your life? A huge new chapter of sorts? Something that was so huge even if it seems small to others? Something that, if it hadn't happened, you know with certainty that your life would've been so much worse? That's what Tapestry and 2009 did for me on those two nights.

32,Musical scores in Voyager: Viewer thoughts?,1592855456,"I watched Voyager back when it was on UPN. It's not my favorite series, but these days, it has become the series that I put on for background noise while I'm working or focusing on something else. (I try this with TNG and I end up watching episodes instead of working.)

I've been thinking about Voyager's incidental music lately as I'm a musician and I've been studying melody and motif. Voyager is kind of bland for various reasons - most of those discussions aren't new and have been rehashed ad nauseam. However, I don't think that Voyager's music has really been discussed, and I'd like to talk about it a bit.

I find myself wishing that Ron Jones had the opportunity to score for Voyager. While the opening theme is nice, I realize that it doesn't really fit the premise of the show (it's kind of safe and happy, from a western theory analysis point of view) and I'm also realizing that the episode scores are very bland overall. Ron Jones did work on The Next Generation; his work was eventually traded for compositions that made less dramatic use of motif and melody, ostensibly to place more focus on the characters and the acting. Unfortunately, in Voyager, the characters and the acting were deliberately toned down in order to place more emphasis on non-human characters. In my opinion, these elements combined result in an overall lack of dramatic tension in Voyager.

In later seasons, there are moments where a stronger score may have enhanced an emotional scene - either through the use of dramatic melody or leitmotif. One episode that comes to mind is Season 7, Episode 2, where Seven is dying because of a cortical node failure and Icheb opts to donate his to save her life. The score for these scenes seems to be recycled, which is unfortunate. (Contrast with the opening scene in ""A Matter of Perspective"", Season 3, Episode 14 of The Next Generation, where a seemingly mundane activity is infused with powerful emotion through music alone.) I find myself thinking that a different approach - possibly by Ron Jones, or someone else - would have made for much stronger scenes in general.

I like the clumsiness and naivety of the crew, that gets often spanked by a reality that is way harsher than they expected. The chemistry between them isn't optimal, also because roles, procedures and hierarchy aren't solid and ""old"" enough to be ingrained. There is no big, powerful Federation behind them, there aren't written rules and foolproof protocols to apply to every problem. They have to scrape together some solution and try to make it work.  


I LOVE that they didn't even install proper weapons for a good while, and they are later forced to become more and more aware of how much being militarily prepared is worth in an hostile galaxy. The episode where they all get obsessed with single tasks has Reed implement an emergency procedure that puts the ship in a battle-ready state; before the crisis Archer and the other officers see it as unnecessarily ""militaristic"", but the procedure saves the ship and Archer decides to keep it after the crisis is averted.

The somewhat ""low tech"" and the different approaches to problems are intriguing, as is the conflicted relationship with the Vulcans, exemplified by the constant state of sub-conflict with T'Pol.  


I like Archer: he's genuinely a good guy but you clearly see he hasn't enough experience to handle most situations, so he has to blunder his way through events. It's also interesting to see the various mechanics between the crew, with the different roles and whatnot.   


Tucker and Reed are fun: they make for a relatively good couple of different characters that have difficulties working togather because of their very different personality and mannerism, but that can overcome it because they genuinely want to do a good job. They also have complementary humor styles, and even their accents are completely different from each other. The episode where they are stuck in the shuttlecraft and think they will die worked well IMHO.  


T'Pol makes for an excellent Vulcan, IMHO. The only thing I really don't like about her are her lips: they are waaay too big and look weird to me. But the acting? Very very good.  


Hoshi is another good character: she shows her insecurities and strenghts at the right times.  


Mayweather is less stellar, to me. He should be played more for his boomer background, that's when he gets interesting, providing new perspectives to his otherwise competent but not that exciting role.  


Dr Phlox may be my favourite: he's just too much fun. Indredibly competent, witty, interesting at all times.

“Lying spoonheads are all the same.”

“No...”

&gt;BASHIR: Fine. You must do what you want. But I think you're making a mistake. Regardless of what Ghemor's done in the past, he doesn't deserve to die alone. Nobody does.

“Lay off, Julian.”

&gt;GANTT: He died calling your name.

“This really doesn’t have anything to with anything.”

&gt;KIRA: He got so quiet toward the end. I could hear him whispering things. His wife's name, Iliana's, even mine. Then the pain just got too much for him and he just lay there, breathing. And at the end of every exhale, there was this pause, and I thought that's it. It's over. Then he'd force another breath, and another. I started counting them. One hundred, two hundred, three hundred. He was fought for every last second. I don't even think he knew I was there.

“Is she sad? Is she crying!? What is going on!?”

&gt;KIRA: Maybe he gave me something I needed. I missed my father's death by less than an hour. Did you know that? Less than an hour. I always told myself that it was bad luck, bad timing, the will of the Prophets. But the truth is, I didn't have to go when I did. I could have stayed a while longer. I saw my chance to get out and I took it. I saw so much death during the occupation, I felt so much pain. But my father, he was my strength, and I couldn't stand to see that strength slipping away. So I ran.

*Angry silence*

&gt;KIRA: I owed it to him. I owed it to my father to get it right this time.

“This is fiction, right? Some Cardassian propaganda?” *voice cracks*

&gt;DUKAT: I would like his body transferred to my ship. We'll take him home and bury him with full state honours.

“Give him *nothing*.”

&gt;(Kira has buried Ghemor next to her father.)

“Is she...what? I can’t watch this.”

*Closing comments*

""I don't know what it is that I just watched, but all I can say is that they have *way* too much time on their hands and clearly don't know the first thing about me, and have no respect for Bajor's culture or our spiritual beliefs.

61,Star Trek Month-by-Month: October 1987,1592793711,"I've started a broader project of consuming media (games, film, TV, music) from the late 80's month by month to get a broader sense of American culture at the time.  I started last week with September 1987 and continued this week with October.  I'm using the opportunity for a rewatch of 80's and 90's Trek, and I decided to separate out my thoughts on Trek here rather than including them in my other posts.  I specifically chose to start this project in September 1987 because of The Next Generation, which I didn't start watching until the early 90's when I was a little older.

We had the following episodes in this week's watch-through:

*Encounter at Farpoint* \- 9/28/1987  
*The Naked Now -* 10/5/1987  
*Code of Honor -* 10/12/1987  
*The Last Outpost -* 10/19/1987  
*Where No One Has Gone Before -* 10/26/1987

Looking at early TNG through the lens of late 80's culture has definitely brought a different spin to my take on it.  The greed and capitalist fervor of the Ferengi are meant to be loathsome to the audience, but they aren't nearly as menacing or exciting as the Klingons and Romulans of TOS, as it looks like they were meant to be.  They were talked up quite a bit in the early episodes only for their initial appearance to be a little underwhelming.

I tried to view *The Naked Now* and *Code of Honor* through the lens of a TOS fan watching a new series with uncertainty, and watching them with that context brings a better understanding of what the writers were thinking.  The second episode seems a little early to be doing the ""everyone behaves goofily"" episode when we don't really even have a good handle on how the crew should be behaving normally, but the callbacks to TOS would presumably have been familiar to a fan at the time.

*Code of Honor*...yeesh.  I knew going in that it would be rough, but especially in the context of current affairs today...yeesh.  The saving grace is Fred Steiner's incredible musical score, which I had totally missed on my first watch-through years ago.  It's sort of TOS meets TNG, and was his only score for the series.  Definitely going to be listening to it again in isolation from the episode.

The writers didn't have a great handle on Wesley either, much to the character's detriment - I fear that too much of this wunderkind-saves-the-day shtick early on would have soured people's opinions on him, making it hard to fully redeem him later on.  I see what they were going for in *Where No One Has Gone Before*, with the Traveler recognizing his potential for greatness, but they didn't need to whack us over the head with it like a sledgehammer every chance they got.

Do you have any memorable experiences or thoughts to share about these early TNG episodes?  I would particularly love to get the perspective of fans who watched them when they aired originally in 1987.  I'll continue these month-by-month rundowns of the shows each week if there's enough interest.

The thing i wanted to say was this. during the episode, Chakotay visited Neelix in the mess hall twice (Once about halfway in, and once in the ending). Most importantly the in the end of the episode. Neelix said some very philosophical things about love, when Chakotay wondered why she didn't love him back after her memory had been wiped (long story), even though he had fallen in love with her again, after having forgotten about her.

Since most Trek podcast hosts are male, we thought it might be interesting to have an all-female perspective, but without the feminist agenda. We're Millennials who grew up on 90s Trek, but we're also watching a lot of Trek for the first time since not all of us have seen everything (particularly TOS). I was hoping we could get some constructive feedback from Trek fans about how we can improve. We've managed to find a small audience since starting last September, but I know there's always room to get better. Your honest suggestions/feedback are much appreciated! We're not looking to make money or be famous, but we do want to put out content worth listening to. Thank you!

88,"Long Time Star Trek Fan Finally Watches DS9: Season 5, episodes",1592750957,"By Inferno’s Light (the part two that I couldn’t stay awake for last night): I love Worf’s sparring with the Jem’Hadar. And I regret trusting Gal Dukat, that one was a little embarrassing. Trusting Fake Julian? Honest mistake. Trusting Gal Dukat? A little dumb. Speaking of which, Fake Julian is still absurdly creepy. Especially when he takes on a female voice after knocking out the runabout crew. Garak’s personal plot line along this was interesting. The claustrophobia was an odd little sidebar. Unexpected, certainly. A little weird. I didn’t love his internal dialog about it, though. It was uncomfortable. That said it felt... realistic in a way? I very much do that in the difficult parts of my training. The ending to this was a little bit of a let down. No resolution really, barely got rid of Fake Julian, suddenly uncovered a plot to destroy the solar system and suddenly undid it. It was just very abrupt. I liked the first half way better.

Doctor Bashir, I Presume: Bashir’s episodes are very, very Bashir focused. This feels intentional, to accentuate that arrogance we see in him. But it’s pretty funny. This guy setting up the program is Voyager’s doctor, right? Seeing Julian react to his parents was one of those moments on this show I love. We vaguely knew that Julian didn’t get along with his parents, from when Odo and Sisko went to earth, and he refused Odo’s offer to visit them for him. We also get bits of that conflict from when O’Brien speaks fondly of home in Ireland and Julian simply runs with his stories instead of sharing his own. But this is the first time we see that conflict outright and I’m into it. Family dynamics are complicated. We’ve seen a lot of close relationships between parents and children on Star Trek, like Sisko and Jake or Beverly and Wesley. 

When Julian calls himself, “Unnatural, meaning ‘not from nature’” to Miles I think part of him died. And what’s worse is that Miles believed it at first. But I like the way Miles turned it around as they talked. I think it’s really interesting how Julian said that his father pushed him to become a doctor. I guess I believed that was just fundamentally who he is. I mean, it is now. But it wasn’t always. Julian is pretty brutal to his dad. Which I halfway understand but I also... holy crap. It was just so arrogant to tell his father that he is his only accomplishment. And I mean more arrogant than Julian usually is. I feel like Julian isn’t going to recover from this one, especially since now everything he does is going to be attributed to genetic enhancements. That said, I did really like the darts scene where Miles points out that if his hand eye coordination has been improved, how is he playing so badly? That’s cute. That means the Julian has faked winning and losing streaks for years because he enjoyed spending time with Miles. 

I did know about this episode from about season 2, but I thought it happened later in the series. That said, I personally do support genetic engineering, or at least more conversation and research about it. We could get more Khans, or we could get more Julians. But if nothing else, for humans now in 2020, we could get people without crippling genetic disorders. Now I’m not saying that Julian “needed” genetic engineering. He’s right to be mad at his parents: he didn’t. Just because his life would have been different would not have necessarily made it worse. But at the same time, it very clearly didn’t harm him in this particular case. Julian has a life he’s happy with. I hope that in future episodes he can focus on being grateful for that and not depressed that people know, but I get the sense from previous discussions that it’s more or less the latter. 

I’m going to be totally honest I didn’t care about Rom and Lita. If they had put that in a different episode I think I would have been more invested, because I do care about Rom’s happiness.

93,"What do you all think of this storyline- I wrote this before PIC aired as my hope for the plot of the show. Intended to post for people to add on to or change based on what theyd want to see, but never did, so might as well now :)",1592740733,"Story for Show:

20 years after dominion war, Federation and Cardassia rebuilding. Civil War on Romulus, Cardassian terrorists attacking federation, wanting liberation. Cold war with Breen, still unknown who they are – constantly fighting with them. Inner conflict between exploration/peace and militarizing and closing borders. Militarizing has been winning, fear since attack on earth. Starfleet split into two, civil war almost appearing inevitable.

Story line starts with the above. New ship and crew are stationed in Cardassia, supporting local government in tracking down terrorists. Plot leads them to discovering Breen involvement in terrorist attacks, as civil war breaks out on Romulus they are also able to connect Breen involvement, pushing the cold war narrative between the two powers. Federation becomes openly involved in Romulan civil war once news of Breen involvement has been made known, move made to protect newly formed ties with Romulus and push back Breen influence. Internal struggle in Fed because it may create open war with Breen and it is against Starfleet principles to interfere. New ship and crew sent to Romulan space to assist with relocating civilians.

Meanwhile…

Picard (who is now retired) senses borg invasion. No one listens, haven’t heard from borg in 20 years. Threat of civil war, conflict with cardassian terrorists, cold war with Breen, and romulan civil war pulling federation in. Laforge (now captain of enterprise) and Admiral Riker, listen to Picard. Riker sends Enterprise on rogue mission to find evidence, pulling enterprise out of Romulan conflict. The crew on the new ship is redeployed by Starfleet to find Enterprise and escort back, Riker is arrested. New ship is unable to locate the enterprise because they have turned off their transponder to operate in stealth (sounds like something star treky haha). Picard works with Laforge to tap into borg signals Picard picks up through brainwaves, able to determine location of Borg signals. When Enterprise enters they find thousands of Borg ships and a staging base nearing completion – Enterprise jumps to warp when Borg cube spots them and moves to intercept, cube enters warp and is slowly gaining on them. Enterprise sends distress signal and warning about Borg invasion and fleet and reactivates transponder, allowing ship to reappear on federation sensors. Borg cube catches up and knocks the Enterprise out of warp and locks on with tractor beam draining their shields, suddenly a second cube drops out of warp – it looks like the end for the Enterprise, but unexpectedly the first cube drops its tractor beam and moves toward second cube. A fire fight breaks out, leaving Picard and LaForge stunned. They receive a message from the second cube, it’s signaling they arrived to help. The enterprise joins the fire fight against the first cube. Meanwhile, the new ship receives the distress signal from the enterprise and is now able to track their movement. The new ship intercepts the Enterprise in the middle of the firefight with the two borg cubes. Confused and stunned about what they are seeing, they quickly move to assist the enterprise. When fight is over we find out that Hue has been leading a liberation movement against the borg. Voyager and 7of9’s liberation of drones with unimatrix zero allowed Hue new allies and a way to start freeing other drones. War is about to break out between the fedearation and borg as the staging area is complete, but now the federation has borg allies – increasing their odds of survival. 

As war between the Federation/Borg Allies and Borg begins, the Breen try to take advantage of the situation by increasing support for Cardassian and Romulan civil war effort. As Borg start invading the Alpha quadrant, both Cardassian and Romulan colonies are invaded – the Federation sends ships to defend/protect the colonies while the Breen pull back. This pushes the Breen into isolation and solidifies alliance with Cardassian and Romulans. All out war has begun.

New ship/crew work with Borg resistance to try and liberate more borg, knowing that they can’t win by force of arms. While working they discover a way to use nanites to prevent borg ability to assimilate and adapt, they are able to infect all borg with essentially a sterilization program. The Borg now can no longer assimilate, their strategy becomes more cautious as for the first time ever they face an existential crisis. 

New ship and crew work with liberated borg to invade delta quadrant, where they begin liberating all borg. All that is left is queen – who is separated from the collective and left as an individual. No longer able to shift consciousness or assimilate, she is trapped in one body and brought to a federation prison. To end her storyline permanently, she would decide to stop eating to slowly starve herself to death. As she is dying, Picard visits. They share a very strange intimate moment where Picard looks upon her with pitty and sadness as he watches her die, he can see the fear and defeat in her as she dies a lonely death. It is also a pivotal moment for the Picard character, who after having had his humanity stolen has struggled ever since. He finally watches as the Borg are defeated but discovers that it wasn’t just his humanity stolen, his obsession with them for the past 40 years has robbed him of his life. 

With Borg defeated, new/crew ship are hopeful that new age of peace for Federation is on the horizon. However, the war strengthens the voice of warhawks. It was a costly war with millions of lives lost. The Breen are on the move again and the federation is finding itself yet again in a conflict between exploration and militarization.

95,Stray thoughts on Voyager,1592736991,"this is my first time watching, and i am on season 4 and it is so much fun! 

1) seven of nine is so charismatic- i dont know if it is because she is so goddamn beautiful or if it is something about her personality

2) i miss kes- she now feels like she was the prequel to  a character like jean grey from xmen. i like her soothing voice 

3) Chakotay sucks- why is he always taking the opposite, lamer stand against janeway when it comes to some ethical issue

4) I dont know what to think about Tom and B'leanna's romance. Though it has not been sudden, it feels sudden and Tom's character has been a bit annoying like his voice seems more nasal now that he is in love lol

5) Neelix is so much more tolerable now as someone from here assured me sometime ago- how he shows seven of nine to swallow food made me laugh

6) Kate Mulgrew in any crisis situation darts her eyes like crazy. i guess she thinks it is some intense acting method like joey's fart acting but it is cute because it is Janeway 

7) I love how Janeway has pure power. she doesnt have to suck up to anybody or tolerate anyone like picard had to with generals. because they are stuck in delta quadrant she just takes efficient decisions without coming across as a dictator. she is so cool!

99,I just finished Startrek TNG - here is a couple of question - can you answere them ?,1592730293,"I really enjoyed the series ... although i cant tell if i liked it more than the original series. They are both so good in theyr own way. 

But  you cant deny that there are some aspects of TNG that are really REALLY terrible ! 

i will start with the questions that bothered me the most.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Why did they keep [Mr.Data](https://Mr.Data) as a crew member after he got infiltraded again and again and again. He got infiltrated by his evil brother. By the Borg. He started to have dreams wanting to kill his friends...i cant remember exactly how many times he put the entire crew in serious danger but it really struck me how often it was ! Why has no one ever considered firing him ? 
2. why did they keep using the holodeck although it was malfunctioning sooo many times. The safetyprogramm is a joke ! It only works 50% of the time. the other times "" shit goes real "" and they get shot or stabbed  and cant leave the simulation. At some point it even creates its own AI and they even admit that they dont know what the hell is going on and how to explain its anomalies. Even the simulation of Prof. Moriarty  takes over the entire ship. What a joke ! They keep using the holodeck. What kind of Captain is Picard, is he stupid ?
3. Why did the writers constantly build up the sexual and love-tension between riker and troi just to ammount to ... nothing ? although i really really enjoyed the lovescene between Worf and Troi, where they couldnt resist anymore. It was realistic and relatable and it just really felt right ! Because thats how love is. It suddenly is there ! And you cant help it ...  
But Troi seriously seemed to have strong feelings for Riker and they keep flirting every now an then. And at some point she is suddenly just a friend ... and then again he admits to still has feeling for her. And she even hooks up with his alternative universe Riker and Tells him that she will wait for him. But then she ends up with Worf. What a madness - so unsatisfying !
4. Wich brings me to my next point - Polyamoury : No one seems to take faithfullness and loveloyalty seriously. Riker hooks up with every sexy woman possible- then leaves them. He falls in love, then leaves them or the girls die. Same with Picard - they build a really nice relationship but then they all diappear or leave the crew or die . Whenever there is a relationship between 2 guys i instantly knew someone will leave the show and we will never see them again.  Although it would have been so much more relatable to see them interact and conflicting between family and duty. instead they keep having affairs all over the space . Does nobody have any moral standards to keep a promis they make to theyr loved ones ?

6,Some thoughts on finally watching every episode of classic Star Trek,1592716134,"I always watched the movies with my dad growing up but never got into the shows until Enterprise. So yes I may be a bit biased but Enterprise was my first series. I knew people hated it but I always liked it. And some of my opinions will be against the grain.  
  
I started with TNG, then Voyager, DS9, and finally TOS. Each series started off pretty slow, but TNG and DS9 finished really strong. I found TOS to be the weakest show in all honesty, there were far too many episodes with god-like beings and I glossed over a lot of them. The post-episode Kirk/Spock/McCoy shenanigans were usually the best part of the episode. Voyager was mostly bland and I don't remember much from it.  
  
Kirk and Picard were the best captains, Kirk was a bit more cavalier and fun to watch while Picard always had the right answer. Sisko bugged me just as often as he grew on me. Janeway stole the episode from her officers a lot, especially in the beginning. Archer was kinda bland at times, I think they tried to blend Kirk and Picard.  
  
Data is probably my favorite character ever. Geordi, Paris, and Trip are my favorite side characters. All the doctors were great except for Crusher, who was pretty bland. I loved the Doctor and Phlox. My favorite reoccurring characters are Shran and Q. I hate all Ferengi except Quark, and what seems to be an unpopular opinion here I loath Lwaxana to the core.  
  
I loved First Contact as a kid, but I found it to be a short action flick this time around and Generations was the only TNG movie I liked. Most of the Original Series movies are excellent.  
  
Finally, I started episode 1 of Enterprise directly after finishing TOS and I do get the hate. Its tone is so different from the other series and the Vulcans are fucking annoying.

10,Long Time Star Trek Fan Finally Watches DS9: Season 5 episodes 11-14,1592701757,"The Darkness and the Light: I am impressed with this episode where the detail they planted at the beginning was finally important to the conclusion. Usually things like “the herb counteracts the sedative” are forgotten in this show by the resolution. So it was satisfying that it came into play. I really like some of the messaging here. It was one of those episodes where yeah, the bad guy is clearly a little crazy. But you know... he has a bit of a point. I believe in non-violence to an extreme degree, and I agree that war crimes against innocents/non-aggressors should be reconciled with on both sides. So his mind set of killing people he thought were guilty with no innocent casualties was definitely interesting. This is like some of the previous episodes in the earlier seasons where they deal with some of the issues faced by transitional societies. I really like their willingness to take on these issues but I tend to wish the show as a whole took a stronger stance. What I like here is that the bad guy clearly got to Kira, and caused her to recognize that while she may have been justified, she did cause harm. 

The Begotten: Guys I really want to poke the baby changling. I have never seen a birth on a tv show where a birth actually seems relatively realistic. Julian is busy. Kira is a long way from actually delivering even though she is in labor. So Julian steps off to do his other work. I really don’t like Dr.Mora. On a lot of levels. Did Kira dye her hair? Because I liked it better before. But you know... details? This episode is simultaneously so happy and so sad. I was waiting for that conflict for Kira where she would want to keep the O’Brien’s kid. I think she handled it really well by just sort of taking it and talking to Odo, but I’m glad they addressed it. And Odo lost his child but he gained back something fundamental to him and it is so painful but so wonderful. 

For the Uniform: A small detail, but I love watching this team operate a Starship. I love watching them as a team collectively. That dynamic makes me so happy but I feel like we know this team differently than a team like Next Gen. It’s not “big happy family.” It’s WAY more complex and it’s super exciting to watch them come together. I just wish Odo was on the Defiant more. Or that we could see them function together in Ops more. 

I absolutely love Nog’s role in this episode, and he plays it very well. It reminds me of old wartime radio operators. It gives me such a specific feeling, reminds me of studying the Vietnam War when I was younger. I know that echoing on a slight delay from poetry and film. Anyone here ever watch M*A*S*H*? It reminds me of that. The more I watched Nog repeating the orders down to engineering, the more memories I unlocked. I’m really grateful for that. 

Hot take. I’m pretty mad at Sisko for his choice of actions in this episode. Edington is totally right about him. There is ALWAYS another way. Worf is well aware of this, which we see when he hesitates on a direct order that would otherwise excite him as a Klingon. He has learned better. Kira is just shocked. But Dax seems to be all in. I am glad Sisko is becoming a stronger character, but I don’t love who that character is. 

In Purgatory’s Shadow Part 1 (yes I am seriously going to split this two-parter up between two blogs, I’m tired): Really? We’re throwing Worf on this mission? I love the Julian/Garak scenes but we’ve gotten less of them. This show is more focused on maintaining the duties of characters than those dynamics, it would seem. Julian is station doctor. He’s not meant to go running off on a suicide mission he isn’t trained for. But boy does he know Garak well. Worf doesn’t have that dynamic (although I did love “At the first sign of betrayal, I’ll kill him. But I’ll return the body in tact.”) but he is skilled in combat. 

OH Ziyal is the creepy one, not Garak. 

Oh THAT’S what you guys meant when you said we’ll meet “the real Martuk.” Changling Julian is caring in the wrong way. Julian isn’t thoughtful, he’s thorough. And changling Julian is also SUPER creepy. This show has a unique ability to make my stomach drop. 

Garak: “Let this be a lesson to you, Doctor. Perhaps the most valuable one I could ever teach you. Sentiment is the greatest weakness of all.”
Julian: “If that’s true, it’s a lesson I’d rather not learn.”  I hope to God I am learning from Julian as I watch this show. Speaking of real Julian, he is so broken in this episode. And when he finds out Tain is Garak’s dad who disowned Garak, he visibly breaks a little bit more. And speaking of Garak, THIS IS WHAT I WANTED TO SEE! For those of you who regularly follow this blog, you’ll remember I was disappointed that Garak was a spy who betrayed a higher up in the Obsidian order because it was boring after all that buildup and subterfuge. This is WAY more exciting. 

As final thoughts for this episode, I loved it, I’m having a lovely time. I clearly love and trust too freely though because it STILL hadn’t occurred to me that someone on the station could have been replaced by a changling even though I was just complaining about what an obvious plotline that is during the Klingon episode. APPARENTLY NOT. That’s honestly a little embarrassing. I’m saving the second half of this story for tomorrow because I’m completely wiped out.

B) where did the main female Klingon’s (can’t remember her name) massive facial scar go? She got blasted in the face with a phaser and bore the scar for the remainder of the first season, now it’s suddenly gone?

C) what exactly is the deal with ash Tyler/ voq? There’s been so many attempts at an explanation but he himself seems to change his mind every episode he’s in so I’m very confused right now.

I personally don't care about Icheb's character, but I didn't want to see his eye get ripped out. The swearing(a thing I tend to defend, because I have a sailor's mouth) could be toned back a bit(maybe replace a fuck with a shit or damn or other applicable swear). Season 1 was all over the place and was ridiculous. The Hologram consoles are stupid(so is the imagination wand of +20 repair), bring back LCARS or something similar. It focused(imho) on the wrong side characters(Killing Hugh and leaving behind Picard's former Tal Shiar friends was a mistake, again imho). 

BUT I think that some people(a potentially small Minority I keep bumping into or maybe the majority, idk) are giving Picard, the Character, a Bad Rap. Most of what Picard does in Season 1 is Picard-y. I can't actively think of anything he does that is super blatently out of character(I'm sure there's a few things, I'm just dumb and can't remember them). Jurati murdered Bruce Maddox, Picard's like ""Turn yourself in to pay for your crime"" instead of calling for blood or even being angry. Raffi is in a Very dark place, Picard's there if she needs him(even if its as a verbal punching bag, catharsis can be helpful). Rios is closed off and distant, Picard helps him open up a bit. Elnor(is that how it is spelt?) was hurt by Picard abandoning him, Picard wants to make that right and tries his best. The Android colony is manipulated into opening the wormhole for the reapers(which is dumb imho), Picard reaches out to the one he thinks can stop it, even giving his own life to prove his point. Picard in PIC is just as Picard-y as he's ever been and I do not understand some of the dislike I've see for Jean Luc in PIC. Again the show has A LOT of problems, I cannot and will not deny that, I just don't think the problems lay with Picard himself.

And also having a great time falling in love with these characters again. In this exciting post, I don’t hate Quark for the first time!


Things Past: I’m writing up this episode after the fact so it’s going to be a less detailed discussion than my other season five posts. I liked this one. I was a little confused. I also felt like it started cool and then puttered out a little. The real danger here was that they could accidentally kill themselves psychosomatically. So Garak gets hit in the face, bursts a blood vessel. Jadzia gets blown up and... nothing? So that was a little weird to me. But other than that I liked the concept. I like the thought that Odo is still not completely human because to me, that opens up  the possibility that he could become a shapeshifter in the future. You guys haven’t told me that doesn’t happen yet so I’m going to keep hoping. 

The Ascent: 
Nog: “Muscles, Jake! You know! The things that are supposed to go between your bones and your skin!” Look I’m all for hating on the ferengi but this has been one of my favorite lines so far in the show. I feel attacked. I honestly wouldn’t have thought Jake would be the messy one. But I suppose Jake is the one experimenting with freedom. I’m an adult, a relatively composed one, but I can’t get to my own closet. In my defense I live in a tiny room where the bed takes up almost the whole thing, but still.

There is a lot of biodiversity for a “barely habitable” planet. Odo and Quark splitting the clothing evenly is pretty funny. Details like Quark wearing the left glove and Odo wearing the right glove are why I love this show. Honestly I don’t think Quark would do something bad enough to warrant a major Federation prosecution. I am not going to lie I loved watching Odo hit the crap out of Quark thinking he was dead and freaking out. Not because I wanted Odo to hit Quark, but because Odo really thought Quark was dead and really didn’t know how to move on from there. “Stop looking at the leg, you’ll pass out again.” I enjoyed this episode way more than I would have thought. It was a lot of fun. 

Just as a side note, Kira has been pregnant for a long time in a show where one season is a year and her gestation time is 5 months...

The Rapture: did we get new Star Fleet uniforms? I really like them except the darker the uniforms, the less contrast and the less contrast, the less I can see in the darker toned episodes. Also I just love the bright colors. But these feel cozy. 

Okay KASSIDY was a TERRORIST, why are we bringing her back? Are we seriously not able to to come up with a new love interest for Sisko?

I live for Bajoran politics. Winn is a bad, bad person. And it’s thrilling. I think it’d be kind of cool if there was an episode where someone was trying to kill her and she comes to the station for help. I am kinda surprised there weren’t more consequences for Sisko. I mean, I see why there weren’t but I also think they could have come up with SOMETHING. And I disagree with Julian’s medical ethics. Sisko refused the surgery when his synaptic abnormality was relatively small. Who knows what he would have said when it became more extensive and he lost the ability to consent? I mean obviously we know he didn’t want it, but still. The situation had changed and Sisko was unable to communicate consent, Bashir shouldn’t have needed next of kin IMO. But ya know, cheers to Bashir for that ethical commitment. I don’t even get why Bajor has to argue about joining the federation. Honestly what do they have to lose?

The Federation (in Discovery) not allowing the use of mines definitely makes sense - it absolutely matches contemporary progressive politics - but this scene goes on to imply:





1) Mines are so prohibited that the Federation didn't even build their own, they outsourced






2) The Federation would not allow them in a time of war, either, though that was the reason for their usage





The Federation began mining the wormhole BEFORE there was an official declaration of war from the Dominion, and they did it in Bajoran space - seemingly unilaterally, without the Bajoran government's consent, as that would have provoked the Dominion in the very way Bajor was working hard to avoid - which would seem to be two pretty dramatic breaches of Federation philosophy.

61,The Unspoken Reboot &amp; The Future Of Trek Canon,1592593893,"If this seems under-formulated, that's because it is. I'm thinking out loud and I ask that you simply help by offering your **constructive input** as I work through these ideas.

I did not grow up with Star Trek. When I was in my late 20's, I decided to give it a go and the consensus online seemed to be that DS9 was the best series for a newbie. (this occurred before I joined Reddit and I now see that most here recommend TNG to the first-timers who post here asking this question) Once I viewed DS9 and knew I liked the Trek universe, I decided to watch the whole thing in release order, from TOS to ENT. This was around the time that DIS was first released.

Sadly, I could not even make it through the first season of TOS and became a bit disheartened. Internet chatter suggested that I would also experience some difficulty enjoying TNG but that I should be patient as it got better. Overall, I think TNG is good enough that it's possible to ignore its shortcomings. I went on to watch VOY and ENT, liking each Trek iteration more than the last.

Which brings me to the current year, where I finally watched the Kelvin films and DIS. And what I've learned in these few years as a Trek fan has been and remains very difficult to put into words. IMO, they get better with each series. I must assume this has something to do with more modern expectations about sci-fi and cinema in general. At this moment in the conversation, I'm tempted to make some remarks about the schism in the fanbase but opportunity for that discussion will likely present itself in the comments. For now, I'm trying to explain something else I've noticed in the Trek canon: *an unspoken reboot*.

My headcanon consists of the following:

* ENT
* DIS
* \[soon: SNW\]
* the Kelvin trilogy \[parallel timeline\]
* TNG
* DS9
* VOY

Admittedly, much of this depends upon speculation about what SNW may provide. But, since I pay near-zero attention to TOS, I have to make sense of canon without it; In this regard, I've noticed that it's not only possible but it's become much easier since viewing DIS and the Kelvin trilogy. What this suggests to me is a subtle modernization of canon. The older material is slowly being retconned and rebooted out of relevance. It seems to me possible that SNW may actually supplant TOS for a new generation of Trekkers. If DIS and SNW form a coherent enough bridge between ENT and TNG, it renders TOS obsolete and new entrants into Trek fandom will have a completely novel conception of Star Trek.

Perhaps this discussion pertains more to newer and younger Trekkers. But I would like to hear all (calm and reasonable) voices on the matter. I'm curious if any others share a similar journey through the Trek universe as I have taken. Are there others who also do not watch TOS? In other words, is there any part of canon that you ignore? And what are your thoughts on the idea of the ""Unspoken Reboot""? If new Trekkers begin by viewing the newer material and, like me, cannot overcome the shortcomings of the older material, do you think there may be a newly emergent consensus about what is and is not relevant to canon within the fanbase?

Julian: “And besides, I have to be in surgery, operating on someone.”
Miles: “On who?”
Julian: “I’ll find somebody.”
That transition to Keiko’s abduction was SUPER creepy. Oh, man, the WHOLE THING IS SUPER CREEPY. I’ve been writing these as I watch so I can talk about the cute little details and she does the whole “body stolen by an alien thing” really well. Wow Chao is an incredible actress. 

This one of those, “Okay maybe it’s justified but seriously no consequences for Miles?” Because Miles almost killed the wormhole aliens which I feel like is problematic. Also why haven’t we come up with a better name than “wormhole aliens?”

Trials And Tribble-ations: guys I can’t describe how happy it made me when Julian made the “I’m a doctor, not a historian,” joke. That made my day.
“He put a bomb in a tribble??!” And watching Julian handle the tribble was so cute and sweet. Dax is also amazing in this episode. She both plays her role in the time period and also acts like Dax. I don’t quite get her timeline of hosts, but I love it when she talks about them. Also how did they let the tribbles onto DS9? They saw what happened! I’m surprised I don’t have more to say about this episode. It was fun, I’m super glad they made it, and super impressed with the editing onto the old enterprise. DS9 is the only Star Trek series I’ve watched where I like the time travel episodes. And watching Odo with the tribbles also made me so happy. Odo and Julian, guardians of cute fuzzy things. 

Let He Who is Without Sin: is anyone else uncomfortable? I’m uncomfortable. 

HOW IS DAX INJURING WORF MORE THAN MORE THAN WORF IS INJURING DAX? 

Just a personal pet peeve: I hate in when people say some variation of, “I trust you not to cheat, I don’t trust [insert member of the opposite gender that token you is friends with].” I am so uncomfortable with how Worf is treating Jadzia. Jadzia is fun and exciting, and Worf KNOWS THAT. That’s how they got together. Julian WAY overstepped here and it is so uncomfortable. And why is Julian dating that girl from Quark’s? I’ve accepted that Dax isn’t right for him but her? Jadzia has no self control? I think she has perfect self control, Worf just doesn’t like how she exercises it. I think she has had poor self control in the past, but more in the way that she falls in love a little recklessly. 

I thought it was interesting when Julian said Jadzia was too much work to chase after. Julian seems like the kind of person to put in whatever it takes to the very end, sort of like Miles for Keiko. I just came to see Julian and Jadzia as incompatible because Jadzia wants something spontaneous and exciting, not safe. And Julian is incapable of not being meticulous about it.

Can I just say that I love Julian’s vacation outfit? I don’t know what about it, but it looks so comfortable. Same with Jadzia’s. I love the subtle rainbow but not immature. Curzon’s old lover also had a really cool outfit and boy did Curzon get around. 

I would have dumped the crap out of Worf after that. I’m not in love with the messaging of this episode for younger audiences. Relationships do take work, trust, and forgiveness but you also have a right to put your foot down. What happens when you forgive your partner and they don’t change like Worf did? Do you forgive them again, and again, and again? Worf’s behavior wasn’t a little slip, it was egregious. It just feels a little dangerous to me, especially given the age I watched most of Star Trek.

WOWEE. Well what am I supposed to say after that. Gosh. This post could either be really really long as I try to encapsulate everything I just saw and felt and the ramifications thereof, or it could be really short as I just throw my hands up and go “I can’t summarise this, experience it yourself.”

Now I don’t know if this was one of the best episodes of TOS yet, but it was certainly the most entertaining episode of TOS yet and therefore one of my favourites. There was never a dull moment - right from the beginning straight through to the end, something was always going on, usually something highly unpredictable. It took the madness of the finale of I Mudd and put it in a blender with Squire Of Gothos, Who Mourns For Adonais and Bread And Circuses, yet ended up having its own unique flavour not quite like any other episode.

I laughed so hard my sides hurt, I cried. But was I laughing at it, or laughing with it? The answer is yes. Though this had the ingredients of an unintentional laugh-fest (this is a treasure trove of hilarious out of context clips) it’s actually much more complex than that because I also felt horror, sorrow, fear for Alexander’s life, awe at some of the more risqué elements, astonishment that this exists, and recognition of serious literary and philosophical themes. You know how if you say something “is all over the place” it’s a criticism? This time it’s a compliment. This went pinging crazily about the tonal spectrum, yet somehow it all hangs together, it’s highly cohesive.

Getting into the episode, the roller coaster ride is foreshadowed by the unusually fast, almost rushed opening. IMMEDIATELY we’re down on a planet doing the “little guy with big shadow” gag, responding to a distress call, getting all kinds of exposition. My first unintentional laugh is Alexander suddenly spinning around and racing of backwards but, as will become a theme this episode, the absurdities that I laugh at belie a much more sombre subtext, in this case that Alexander is a psychokinetically controlled drudge. At the time I thought it was odd that Spock and Kirk uncharacteristically stand about doing nothing during the opening while we focus on Alexander, but this is actually good directing - we’re going to need to care about Alexander for this episode to work.

Nice sets, good costumes (except for that idiot with the taped on beard), good special effects. And the cast? Liam Sullivan as Parmen is fine, not remarkable, not much to say there. Barbara Babcock however is splendidly cast as Philana - she appears silly and petty just as she’s supposed to on first glance and then is gradually revealed to be a sadistic monster. Her line when she drops all pretence and says to Parmon “Oh why even discuss it, let’s just get rid of them” is bone chilling. I was quite scandalised when she expresses sexual pleasure and gets off at the suffering of others - though subtle, I think it’s fairly clear that this is what Babcock is going for. This must have been rather daring at the time. And then we have our star, Michael Dunn. I don’t think I’ve ever seen his work before, but I have heard of him because I had a book about inspiring Hollywood stories. He was in it because he used to fly around the country in his own time to meet depressed children with dwarfism to tell them that they could make it if they persevered and took opportunities. Dunn gives one of the better performances from a guest actor ever - he plays the court jester with desperate cheer, has an epiphany as he is inspired by the crew’s resistance, becomes overcome with murderous rage, nobly refuses the gift of power, sinks into despair, and Dunn makes it all believable and cohesive. At the end I thought he was going to die and I was actually concerned, a sign that the episode was working well. He even performs a scene from Aristophanes and makes the authentic frog sound! I wonder what became of Alexander after he went aboard the enterprise?

Then we get into the scene which must have launched a thousand memes, Spock and Kirk’s humiliation. Man I did not know how to take this. It’s laugh out loud funny and stomach turning at the same time, and I think that’s exactly how it should be. Kirk slapping himself is the greatest scene in Star Trek so far.

[https://youtu.be/8qSVb9bQeqM](https://youtu.be/8qSVb9bQeqM)

The drunk walking Kirk, Spock and McCoy do when they’re staggering out of the room is astonishing. This sequence is like a dark mirror to the end of I Mudd, somehow sillier and more serious at the same time. And yet amidst the nonsense, Parmon and Kirk have a profound exchange about justice only being self-aggrandising force. How did the writer and director manage to blend the sublime and the ludicrous so well here? It’s extremely rare. But the scene where Spock and Kirk dance about, I laughed so much my wife called down asking what the hell is so funny. Again, I can’t believe this exists, like a writer pitched it and the production team all nodded and said “yes, let’s roll”. Shatner’s bizarro delivery of the line “Is this your utopia?” is I believe the point where I began to cry. And then the tap dancing; such a strange mix of comedy and horror, it feels like I’m watching Twin Peaks. Spock is doing a silly dance that threatens to actually smash Kirk’s face in. It’s such a perverse concept it almost comes out the other side as beautiful. Beneath my instinctual reaction to laugh at this, there‘s something deeply disturbing about watching a man like Kirk forced to play act being a horse. And there’s the really interesting note about how Spock is traumatised by being forced to express emotions. We get a rare glimpse of a violated Vulcan. Angry, quietly raging Spock is frightening. There’s also the latest in a series of “Kirk explains/guesses the plot” scenes which I’m never crazy about, but this one is acted/written better than usual.

And then suddenly, ladies appear and Nichelle Nichols is dressed for her try out with The Supremes. After the golden line ”Concentrate on raising this plate of fruit... Nothing“ which has me rolling in the aisles again, Spock sings a tender and delicate ballad about putting out while drunk. I’m not joking at all, that’s genuinely what it’s about. This sequence is such a strange and heady brew, but the weirdness makes it counter intuitively more believable, as this is the kind of twisted behaviour such a decadent group as Parmon and his friends might engage in. We even head for BDSM land as the implication seems to be that the Platonians intend to watch the humans fornicate and whip each other. This is wild. And then we have the interracial kiss. I‘ve heard about this moment before and I was a little let down actually. They’re mind controlled so it doesn’t really “count” and Kirk is looking at Parmon the whole time. I actually found the moment BEFORE the kiss when Uhura and Kirk, not wearing very much and pressing together as Uhura tells Kirk how he makes her feel safe, to be a lot steamier than the kiss itself. But even that seems tame next to shots of Philana squirming in her seat for, uh, reasons, as she watches proceedings. (For what it’s worth though, this is apparently not even close to the first interracial kiss on TV. A British TV film from 1959 called Hot Summer Night depicted a romance and kiss between an English woman and a Jamaican immigrant, including a kiss, while British soap opera Emergency Ward 10 went all the way in 1964 by having a white doctor fall for a black female surgeon in a relationship which included banging. However, don’t start clapping just yet, as this is a gold medal worthy example of “so close and yet so far” - the producers got cold feet about the relationship and threw the pioneering strong educated black female surgeon character under the bus. She went off to work in Africa where she promptly died of a snake bite. No I’m not making this up.)

The hits keep on coming with Kirk’s best speech in ages. Passionate, well written, devastating to his foe. And all this verbiage contrasts nicely with the simple, brilliantly delivered declaration “I did”, as Kirk triumphs over Parmon. Kirk continues to kick Parmon’s ass verbally while not accepting his BS surrender, a great finish.

There were some dodgy moments, like how easily the crew got the power and how easily the Platonians surrendered, but overall this was amazing, a real trip.

It isn't something that happened overnight.  So I really don't get the entire arch.  I also don't understand why the Romulan Empire just doesn't fall back on other Romulan worlds such as Cheron.  Star Trek is odd in that it acts like these races don't colonize other worlds (with the exception of humans).  In the original reboot movie by JJ Abrams, there is a comment in it that makes me face palm every time.  They refer to the ""Vulcans"" as an endangered species.  Did the Vulcans not settle other worlds?  There should be billions of them spread throughout the Federation.  Notably worlds like P'Jem would have millions if not billions of Vulcans living on them.  Same would be true of the Romulan Empire.  It would be like the United States losing Washington DC.  Yes, it would be tragic but we have other cities and states.

84,What are your thoughts on Seska?,1592569496,"I think she's a fascinating character that wasn't properly utilized to her full potential. Martha Hackett can act! I just hate the way the Voyager writers killed her off last minute in Basics Part 2. She was supposed to survive and the baby was supposed to be Chakotay's. This would have made an even more interesting story arc for Chakotay and Seska after Basics Part 2. So much lost potential in Voyager.

I wonder if she was an agent of the Obsidian Order. The way she genetically altered her physiology to look Bajoran and the hologram set up for Tuvok were all actions that you would expect from an Obsidian Order agent. I wonder how she shrunk her forehead and removed her cardassian ridges to become Bajoran. Maybe the forehead shrunk process isn't so complicated if Cardassians and Bajorans have the same brain size? It seems like a painful process regardless. Bajorans and Cardassians are both endotherms, have mammary glands, genitalia, lactate and probably have similar internal organs so I imagine Seska got away quite easily but her blood markers were still Cardassian. There's only so much she could do to change her physiology. She had to leave SOME cardassian DNA in case she wants to revert back in the future. It's all science fiction but I love theorizing on these star trek aliens as if they're real.

I also don't think she was THAT evil. She was rotten but nowhere near Dukat/Kai Winn levels of evil. We don't know much about her past but she had so many opportunities to kill Chakotay after State Of Flux and always bluffed. I do think she genuinely loved Chakotay (Martha Hackett even said this) which is why she never killed him, always bluffing, showing deceptive people but they're still capable of love and feelings (even Dukat had feelings) unlike Jem Hadar or The Borg.",startrek,jorgel1955,False,/r/startrek/comments/hbzrir/what_are_your_thoughts_on_seska/

Body and Soul: Arguably the funniest episode in all of Star Trek.

Blink Of An Eye: Voyager’s ‘Inner Light’. You don’t have to have any knowledge of Star Trek. Just science fiction awesomeness.

Course: Oblivion: The threw-you-for-a-curve episode. Mysterious and enthralling.

Scientific Method: Something about evil aliens is just awesome.

Timeless: This episode is timeless.

Workforce: If you ever doubted any of the actors’ abilities in this show, this’ll reassure you. A great ‘going in blind’ episode.

Equinox: Another Federation ship in the Delta Quandrant that’s stranded? What’s not to love about this?

Endgame: I refuse to argue with people on this one.

Coda: Time loop. Janeway dies. Sold.

The Omega Directive: A weird one that just maybe I like. It’s classic Trek though in it’s simplicity.

In The Flesh: HUGE payoff episode after Scorpion. Amazing acting and super cool story.

Latent Image: I’m a sucker for I can’t remember episodes.

4,"Long Time Star Trek Fan Finally Watches DS9: Season 5, episodes 2-4",1592528861,"Strap in guys cuz this is a long post. It is one of the most positive posts I’ve made (if not the most positive). I felt lots of things so I wrote lots of words. Please feel free to join me. 

The Ship: I took the liberty of highlighting some of my favourite lines of dialog during this episode, because it was incredible start to finish. 
Julian: “I’m not a conspirator,”
Odo: “What would you call yourself, Doctor?”
Julian: “An IDIOT!” Julian was so MAD about it too. And really Julian didn’t have anything to do with importing the illegal things! 

Muniz: “I can’t feel my legs.”
Dax: “Don’t worry, they’re there.”

I forgot to write it down but I love Jadzia’s conflict deescalation. She does it a lot, pulling someone away from a bad conversation. But in this episode she was like, “Let’s go take a look at  this thing, while I explain the nuances of diplomacy.” And then Worf was STILL a jerk. Is it just me or does Worf speak his mind a lot more on DS9 then on Next Gen? And okay, we’ve barely gotten to know Muniz why am I crying? Miles cared about him so, so much. Why did they have to do a funeral?? “We will both keep the predators away.” I’m not crying you’recrying. Holy crap so many people just died for no reason. This went from mildly sad to devastating in SECONDS. I fundamentally do not believe that Sisko would make the same trade again if he could. He is more fighty than Picard, and he follows what he technically should do more than Picard, but I still don’t think he’d go through with it. Unrelated but Jadzia felt WEIRD to me in this episode. She felt more Curzon-y than usual, less forgiving, less caring, a little mean. This is also one of the Jem’Hadar episodes that I find creative and exciting.

Looking for Par’Mach in all the Wrong Places: 
Jadzia is back! I missed her innuendos. Where have they been? And also, how is her hair always so stunning. This show is perking back up. Julian seems not depressed, which makes me so, so happy. And this episode is hysterical. “I will apologize for this at a later time-“ proceeds to toss that guy out of a chair. I’m just having a great time again, guys. The scene where Quark, Dax, and Worf are trying to figure out what to do with the fight to the death is so well acted. The scenes with Miles and Kira were so hysterically awkward. And the last scene was so amazing I watched it five times. Every character felt right in place to me (except usually Quark whines more but I’m not complaining). And I feel like I should have seen that coming between Dax and Worf but I didn’t and it made me so happy. Dax LIT UP! That completely brought my character back to life for me. I laughed a lot in this episode and I’m glad I made extra time for it today. 

Nor the Battle to the Strong: I have a lot to say about this episode. Doctor Bashir feels more and more real to me every episode. I’m not sure why I connect to his character so strongly. The messaging in this episode is so, so intense to me. Star Trek likes to push non-violence by avoiding violent conflict- avoiding planet side battles especially. This was so outward.

I loved the scene when Julian is exhausted, laying on the ground with the other two doctors and managed to joke. I worked in healthcare. I am currently working in a lab testing patients for COVID. And I couldn’t do either if I couldn’t collapse in the breakroom with people going through the same things. I wouldn’t make the same joke Julian made at dinner, but... I’ve tried to talk about these experiences with people who haven’t gone through anything. And my jobs were never very intensive. I can’t even imagine a combat situations. I’m grateful they’re showing this, and I think Jake plays a super important role for those of us who can’t put ourselves in those positions. I think a lot of us wonder what we would do if we were actually in pretty much any situation on Star Trek. It’s really interesting to me to watch a non-trained character try to deal with it. 

Also, Julian made a HUGE mistake taking Jake out of the medical facility to get the generator. The officer Jake runs into plays a really important role here for me. They’re still showing the brutality of combat, and Jake is learning something so important. Julian was incredible start to finish. And guys, I even liked the corny Sisko reading Jake’s writing scene at the end of it. This was EASILY my favourite episode of this show so far. I feel so many things. It reminded me to check in with my friends who are on the frontlines in patient care because they are not okay but they are going to act like it until the very end. The message here was so, so beautiful.

Guys, these three episodes have been a complete and utter rollercoaster in the best possible way. Okay, maybe I AM the one crying, but not in the disheartened way I felt when I watched Hard Time. I’m crying because Muniz died first of all. But I’m mostly crying because this means so much to me and THAT is what I remember Star Trek was when I was younger. This is how it’s supposed to hurt! And then we should turn right around and start cheering for Jadzia and Worf and for the future O’Brien kid.

9,A Long Time Star Trek Fan Finally Watches DS9: season 4 finale and season 5 intro,1592518648,"Season 4 finale: AH ODO. This is another one of those meh episodes for me. It was definitely entertaining. I enjoyed it. I think turning Odo into a human was a pretty good twist. But you know, also super sad. Does Odo ever emotionally recover?

The one thing I outwardly didn’t like about this episode is the whole, “Gasp, a high ranking official is actually a changling interfering with alpha quadrant politics!” We KNEW that. If they have operatives on earth, it’s not exactly surprising that they’re also everywhere else. This particular plot “twist” isn’t exactly new to this show. 

Season Three Intro (Apocalypse Rising): There are lots of details to this that I love. Dax went with Sisko to meet with the Star Fleet, which feels right because they’re such old friends. It feels good to watch them side by side (a little weird she didn’t go on the mission but it looks like they’re all males, so I guess it makes sense). What a cool title, by the way. The Kira/Julian scene where he is checking in with her is hysterical. “But I’d rather blame you!” They both look so genuinely happy in that moment, I’m smiling so much just writing about it. THAT acting is why I love this show. Speaking of wholesome, Julian trying to comfort Jake is so sweet. I think it’s cool that we brought Dukat back to help but his daughter has been lost in translation again. She lives on the station... where is she? She’s been in two episodes even though she’s supposedly under Kira’s care. 

Watching each of the characters trying to imitate Klingons is pretty amazing. Sisko does a pretty good job, but it’s clear that he’s not nearly as fluid as Worf. On a cinematic note (which I usually don’t comment on because... what do I know?), the lighting/color scheme of this episode is SUPER dark. I have vision trouble caused by migraines and affected by light changes, and I can’t see a lot of it. I know they probably put a ton of effort into the details of the Klingon sets and costumes but I can’t see about about half of the screen. The episode about Dax, Worf, and the other dude going to find the thing I can’t spell in the cave had a similar problem for me. If there were any cool easter eggs in this episode let me know! The ending was, again, not a terribly surprising, but still kind of exciting. Yet again, Odo was responsible for killing “one of his own.” But I have a feeling we’ll be hearing about that soon. And one of my favorite scenes from this entire series was Odo listening to the bubbles in his drink. I do that and I’ve been human my entire life. It just made me feel good.

As for final thoughts, Odo is the only character who I liked less in this season than in the others. Season 2 Odo was amazing. Season 2 Odo was like a not-so-arrogant, different skill set Julian. And I am so inspired by that value set and conviction. But now Odo is just sad and he has every right to be. We talk about the seasonal Miles gets bullied episode but it’s like the whole series is designed to break Odo down as an entity. I am really looking forward to the episodes in season 5.

34,Let's imagine ourselves some Star Trek!,1592496657,"""Futurama"" awokened a fear in me back in the day when they went to the ""internet"" and went past a chat room where Star Trek Fans where squabbling over who's the best captain, Kirk or Picard. I figured swiftly that ""Star Trek"" is headed for a shitty path when in Futurama's future no one talks about trek that came out somewhere in these thousand years. They could've made the joke go ""who's the best captain, Kirk, Picard or Glorbomof?"" or whatever but maybe they prophetically figured that Trek has had its best days behind it.


I don't know what modern Trek is supposed to be and i don't like it all that much. I'm not going to spout about ""Roddenberry's vision"" or some shit because i don't like his vision because it's bullshit.


It's not the absence of conflict that makes us good people but rather how we deal with conflict.


Once Roddenberry wasn't in control anymore we got ourselves glimpses of a good future for humanity which is the part about Roddenberry's vision that i like.



Good Future for Humanity. That's something i like. In a vast ocean of scifi dystopias where humans eke out a meager living by committing petty crimes in dingy ghettos of vast and soulless megatropolises or amongst the ruins of humanity i find myself a little depressed and quite frankly bored. What irks me is that some people are calling these horrid dystopian hellscapes ""realistic"". Because they aren't. Our standards of living have steadily increased while deaths due to war, disease, starvatation and thirst are steadily decreasing. Not as fast as i would like, granted. But Scifi authors seem to think that we are inevitably careening towards catastrophe and human extinction eventually and, since we're all so mired in pettiness, greed and violence we will have deserved it.


But we all know the most optimistic view of the future. This ""Star Trek"" thingy you might've heard about. Turns out it wasn't ""unrealistically optimistic"" but rather not optimistic enough since we managed to not have a third world war or eugenic wars and we're running out of time to sequester all the poor people into ghettos so they can be oppressed by the rich ""for years"". But sure, we'll be having Bladerunner-esque mega cities in which crime and misery runs rampant because we're all gloomy sods and we like it that way.
Even if that was realistic i'm getting tired of that stuff now. Can we have some good vision of the future again just for the sake of variety?


While it had many things i didn't like but Star Trek mostly managed to inspire me to dream of the stars, which is what i'm going to do now.



I want to see politicians in charge of the Federation who are portrayed in ways that aren't stupid. That's a stable running rampant in many scifi and Star trek runs with the crowd in that aspect. The higher ups are morons and the heroes of our story have to somehow fix it.

I might tolerate the story telling me of things that might sound stupid but they happened in the past and so there may have been factors i can't see. Like that treaty of Algeron thingy. Maybe the federation has gotten something worthwhile out of that.
But generally i want to see the upper echelons of power act with competence. From our modern point of view they should be outright geniuses because they had some centuries of political and diplomatical advances on us.

Politics and Diplomacy are things that do advance.
Otto von Bismarck was a brilliant diplomat in his day. Yet today his dealings with France and Britain could be easily seen as needlessly provocative.Announcing your vast power as the new german empire might work as a deterrent to keep others from fucking with you but they might also see you as a potential threat and figure that it might be good if such a threat could be contained somehow. Which then lead to all of the powers forging alliances resulting in a vast mess of alliances that only needed one thread unraveled to end in disaster.
Nowadays i could've told him that if he told europe that the german empire will be working towards the prosperity of all because it is the most efficient way to ensure prosperity for germany we could've prevented world war 1...


Justinian and Theodora of Byzanthium created an ""all-encompassing"" code of law which is the groundwork of our codes of law to this day. With more then a thousand years of hindsight however we can see that it wasn't quite ""all-encompassing"" enough.



The Federation, being all advanced and shit, has all these historical facts and a few centuries more and all the histories of all the member worlds and should be wondrously good in diplomacy. There should be no one ""Riva"", who spouts some flat phrases that where dated in the renaissance. Cart some decently trained diplomat over there who should be portrayed as a dime-a-dozen genius because of course the federation should have super awesome training for their diplomatic korps which number in the billions. This person goes to war zone and resolves the conflict easily because we do have some experience in doing that.


The Federation should have a decent intelligence service which doesn't consist of mad people. As it is this organization is a threat to the federation as they might provoke a conflict with other powers who don't like to have moles placed in their ranks. The Federation should have the luxury to have other powers be left to their own devices because they're well equipped to deal with any threats should they emerge; which they do anyways so Section 31 seems rather useless.


The Federation shouldn't be overly pacifistic. If there's a threat that can only be dealt with by destroying it then you laser that threat real good. TNG was rather lacking in the whoosh laser kapow department because of budget issues.
Even DS9 with their War arc was somewhat frugal here and there.


But now we can portray a federation who does use violence when it is unavoidable. Could fly around getting shot at by alien species and shoot them back to make them realize that you can shoot back. And then force them to talk to you to make them realize that talking is the smarter option.
I figure you can take big guns to go exploring and by virtue of you not using them against newly found aliens you show them that you are someone who has big guns but won't use them when not called for.



The Federation shouldn't be sinking into corruption and misery for reasons unexplained but rather show how all the negotiations we've done and are doing, all the philosophizing on the uselessness of war and all the economic alliance building hasn't been in vain and ultimately lead to something that isn't a total dystopia. We are moving somewhere, it'd be nice to see some scifi where all our efforts doesn't eventually result in misery but now we have LED lights in our undies.",startrek,Madenmann,False,/r/startrek/comments/hbhlgz/lets_imagine_ourselves_some_star_trek/

This gives us a total of around 50 auxiliary craft between the two ships.  So where would the extra 150 come from?

Worf is still more aggressive than I remember, easily offended. Which is fine, I’m still quite fond of him. I think it’s just indicative of how DS9 seems to have less structure/discipline than a Star Ship. Now, don’t get me wrong, discipline on TOS, Next Gen, and Enterprise is questionable as well, but I’ve only seen Sisko have ANY discipline at all in recent episodes. 

I am becoming more invested in the Jem’Hadar/Dominion plot line. It’s not really my style, because it’s so fighty, but I really like how the characters (except Worf) are willing to change their minds about them, or compromise with them/work with them when they have to. It’s making for more dynamic plot lines, like when Julian tried to cure their dependence on White, Odo tried to help one do something other than murder, etc. I like the overall messaging that you can be something other than what you are told to be, but sometimes it takes a lot of work to break out of. 

The Quickening: I’m pretty sure this show is designed to break your heart for the characters. It’s been a long time since I didn’t use that phrase in a post. But I seriously love Julian. I’m glad we finally acknowledged his arrogance, and I love the way they did that, too. The exchange between Julian and Dax was one of my favourite in the show. It was difficult to have- Julian had to face one of his biggest character flaws and Jadzia was MAD. It felt to me like she knew it wasn’t Julian’s fault, but was upset because she believed in him and was disappointed that he failed. But what Julian poured into this is why I love him so much. I am very emotionally invested in his emotional investment.

This episode also had those little details I love about this show. Like how Jadzia used her hair clip to bargain for a trip to the hospital. They could have just as easily said, “This guy was kind enough to give us a ride.” But they made it more interesting.

Body Parts: okay so by parts they meant the whole body. I love Garak so, so much. “Which way in particular do you want to be assassinated?” And it was pretty cute that the station pulled together to reopen the bar.

89,DS9 and Babylon 5 comparison has made me rethink Sisko’s romantic partner,1592406930,"Okay, as some of you may know Babylon 5 and DS9 we’re running at the same time, with similar concepts and there was a lot of animosity for a time between the B5 creator/showrunner J. Michael Straczynski and the DS9 producers/showrunner because JMS accuses paramount of stealing his concept after he had pitched it to them years before. 

Anyway, regardless of how legit this criticism/accusation is, there are a lot of parallels that makes comparing and contrasting the two interesting. 

Given that part of Sisko’s arc is his acceptance and embracing his role as The Emissary, I find myself wondering if the series and character would have been more interesting (on top of how interesting it already is) if Sisko has been in a romantic relationship with a Bajoran?

We know that the Bajoran culture is very spiritual, and their faith was something that really kept them together during the occupation. But it’s also an entire planet with billions of people. There are likely some who are going to either not believe some seemingly random human, An Alien, is the emissary or that it doesn’t really matter.

If Sisko’s romantic partner was a non religious, or mildly religious Bajoran woman, would that have been more interesting than Cassidy Yates?

There could be a push-pull between both of them thinking of Sisko as the Emissary, what if he comes to accept it before she does? What if she believes right away? What if she tries to prove he’s not, but comes to believe it? 

I think about this because it’s a storyline in B5. There’s no alien gods that Captain John Sheridan is the emissary of but he is foretold to be important in events, and he does become involved with a woman from a deeply spiritual people.

Anyway, let me know. BTW, Don’t get bent out of shape about the show you like being questioned. 

Also, I know you could say “Why can’t Sisko’s partner be a man or non binary or something” and you’d be right, but let’s stick to what could or would be broadcast on syndication/6th network 1993-1999, yeah?",startrek,FausttThaArtist,False,/r/startrek/comments/hat3w9/ds9_and_babylon_5_comparison_has_made_me_rethink/

8,How Star Trek scarily reinforces my paranoia on pandemic,1592369271,"So as a trekkie, Starfleet episodes are my meditative processing period. The sweet relaxing hum of the capital ships or starbases, the professional communication exchanges mixed with personal ones and new discoveries interspersed with philosophical quandaries and their simple direct down to earth approach of a hopeful future.

Something that most trekkies agree are their immense capacity for blind accuracy to a realistic future. So while i was watching to soothe my mind;

DS9 season 3 episode 12 (two parter titled Past Tense) has us trapped in what would be our current real time. In this episode, Earth is suffering some major socio-economic disaster to which the showruners did not go into elaborate depth, however, one could easily replace that vague backstory with one that is inclusive of our current pandemic disaster.

Suddenly, fictional sanctuary districts dont sound so fictional anymore. Normal uncriminalized people are losing jobs, they are losing homes, they are getting sick, and there is only so much economic burden any one institution can handle, let alone a state government.

According to lore, this event happened before the third world war broke out n  Zefram Chocrane hadnt invented warp drive yet. However what an intense paranoia surge went into my being at the thought of how close these scenarios could be in relation to star terk lore compared to reality...

I imagine a slow hesitation in the immediate future when he has to enter one.  

Granted he has to get over it really quick because all their shuttle craft are so broken that they had to be dropped off at the nearest starbase for repairs the couldn't be done on the Enterprise.  At least that is my head cannon explanation to why they didn't rescue Sulu's team with one.  Also there is no signs of trauma by the next episode so I suppose Starfleet officers are made of sterner stuff.

Except when it comes to faith in their captains which is so fragile that if their human weakness is exposed it will completely evaporate.  So McCoy and Spock play ""Weekend at Bernie's"" with good Kirk playing the corpse.

50,Review of Star Trek: PIC,1592327711,"So I've had time to digest Star Trek: PIC, here's my (very unoriginal) review.

Beware, fanboy whining ahead!

**Acting**

I would go so far as to say this is the strongest cast ever assembled for a Trek series. Even the side-characters like Hugh and Bjayzl shone due to the strength of their actors.

**Writing**

Too much melodrama, too much undifferentiated high-stakes action. Some great Picard Speeches and character interactions (Kestra/Soji and Troi/Soji re: being ""real"", Seven/Picard and Hugh/Picard re: being ex-Borg, etc.), contrasted with flowery dialogue (""two red moons, dark as blood!""), and ultimately dragged down by the nonsensical plotting.

The series also makes some immersion-breaking contemporary references. Admiral Clancy's expletives, Raffi saying ""protip"", the Artifact's sign saying ""This facility has gone X days without an assimilation""... I burst out laughing at the scene where Commodore Oh was wearing sunglasses.

**SFX**

When they were subtle (like Rios appearing as multiple holograms simultaneously) they were quite good. Often overdone though (e.g. the minicubes floating around everywhere in the Artifact). Also, an exceptionally petty quibble but Romulan handweapons are supposed to fire green energy, and every transporter we saw used the same blue-white effect instead of a unique one for each race.

**Direction**

Too much shaky-cam for both the fight scenes and the space battles. Dishonourable mention to the moment (complete with camera closeups and swelling background music) as Laris portentously intones ""Wherever this girl is calling her sister from, *it’s nowhere on Earth*!"", as if this weren't a series with ubiquitous interplanetary travel.

**Faux Progressivism?**

As a gay guy I'm always in favour of diversity, but this series did a lot of things that I found questionable, especially in contrast to DSC.

-Caler (Dahj's boyfriend) is black but is killed ASAP.

-Raffi (a black woman) is a damaged, alcoholic, drug-addicted absentee mother living in a shack. The ""conspiracy theorist"" aspect was a perfectly sufficient character flaw without piling on all the racial stereotypes, especially since the actress is forced to mug for comedic effect half the time by the writing. I would have exchanged her actress with Jurati's, especially given that Jurati and Maddox are romantically involved but have a significant age gap.

-Narissa is constantly vamping around and making incestuous remarks to Narek... it's embarrassing, tedious, and a waste of the actress.

-The Zhat Vash and Qowat Milat are both matriarchial... but the former are evil and the latter end up being represented by a man.

-There's an actress with achondroplasia in PIC... relegated to a nonspeaking role [as part of the ""exotic"" atmosphere of Freecloud](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittlePeopleAreSurreal).

-The crimeboss of Freecloud is an evil lesbian who uses sex as a weapon and dresses herself (not just her concubines) for the male gaze. (That said, I thought her actress did a superb job of elevating herself above the material).

-Freecloud has ubiquitous advertisements for female prostitutes, but no men.

**The Synth Colony**

-Synths having to be created in pairs contradicts all prior series and PIC itself (e.g. the mass-produced Mars Synths).

-Maddox giving Dahj and Soji suppressed memories makes no sense. They're less effective as secret agents (e.g. Soji doesn't know how she can detect lies and is therefore tricked by Narek, ultimately endangering the Synth colony), and it's incredibly unethical (e.g. directly leads to Dahj's death).

-In fact, Maddox's plot to use Dahj and Soji to ""find the truth"" is itself an incredibly implausible longshot.

-The Synths gain and lose powers as the plot demands. They can tell when people are lying... except when the heroes are bluffing their way back into the colony. They're superhumanly strong and fast... except when in hand-to-hand combat with Narek at the climactic fight. They're intelligent enough to have genetically engineered defenses, a fancy thought-activated repair tool, and can even mind meld... yet are incredibly naive the rest of the time.

-The orchids are slow, have to launch from the planet's surface, and have no ranged weapons. Fortunately even a Borg cube will just patiently wait for them to attack.

-Soji and the other Synths are immediately willing to summon the UberSynths to kill every non-Synth... and they're supposed to be sympathetic?

**The Zhat Vash**

-The Zhat Vash are as poorly thought as Section 31, and for the basically the same reasons (they don't make sense logistically, their role in the plot would be better filled by an existing organisation, etc).

-They're incredibly incompetent. They beam down to attack Dahj, instead of beaming her up. They trash Maddox's lab, instead of waiting to abduct him.

-Why does Oh think that Jurati of all people would make a useful or necessary intermediary? She could have just placed a tracker on Picard himself.

**Jurati**

-Jurati kills Maddox. Either:

* a) Oh's mind meld forced her to do it... in which case, why was Oh so stupid? They could have used Maddox to find the Synth colony right away without needing Soji!

* Or b) She did it voluntarily... in which case - WTF? Why does everyone just forgive her so quickly? And she can't have been too broken up over Maddox herself given how quickly she migrates to Rios.

**The Federation Is Stupid And/Or Corrupt**

-Caler's death, Dahj's death, the attack on Picard's chateau... characters don't bother to inform Starfleet of anything that happens on Earth, nor does Starfleet notice by itself.

-Raffi's bitter comparison of her shack to Picard's chateau left a very bad taste in my mouth. Trek is supposed to have removed the distinction between haves and have-not's; plenty of hermits we see in older series have moons or even entire uninhabited planets to live on by themselves in luxury so she shouldn't have been reduced to such squalor.

-Also, Starfleet looks incredibly petty and corrupt for firing Raffi just because she worked under Picard (especially since he resigned by choice and wasn't fired). Guilt by association, apparently?

-Rios's old captain immediately killed two people on Oh's orders (on penalty of having his crew executed). Not only does this make the captain look stupid for not first doublechecking with pretty much anyone else in Starfleet, it also makes Starfleet look evil in that such a threat was apparently plausible in the first place.

**Picard**

TNG Picard and PIC Picard are generally the same dutiful, moral character. However his actions during the 14-year gap between those series (e.g. abandoning Raffi, abandoning Elnor, abandoning the Romulans, etc) are like those of an entirely different character... it's as if PIC Picard has to run around apologising for the actions of a Founder that impersonated him for over a decade.

**The Borg**

There are solid positives of the Borg subplot (IMHO both Hugh and Seven had perfectly logical progressions from their TNG/VOY arcs), outweighed by how generally pointless it all turns out to be later on (especially the drones being vented into space and the cube crashing).

**The Romulans**

The Romulans are simultaneously a beaten and broken race of refugees... who also control the priceless Artifact... and have a secret cult with a fleet of hundreds of ships and infiltrators at the top of Starfleet. The refugee aspect and the Artifact aspect and  the Zhat Vash aspect should have each have been split between multiple different races, they don't make sense in combination.

**The UberSynths**

This is the only Trek plot I can think of that would have been improved by using time travel i.e. if the Zhat Vash vision was from the future (or better yet a *possible* future) and therefore predetermined, instead of being a misinterpreted recording from the past. There are just too many plot holes:

-Obviously there have been plenty of Synths in Trek already as far back as TOS, so the arrival of the UberSynths clearly isn't inevitable.

-If the vision is a warning from the past, who left it there? The Zhat Vash should have reasoned the UberSynths couldn't have been all that unstoppable if someone was able to leave a warning. We later find out the vision was left by the UberSynths themselves - but if so, why hasn't the galaxy been under their control since then?

-If the stakes are that high, why are the Zhat Vash so secretive? They should be openly warning everyone in the galaxy about the prophecy, even inviting every race to come and see it for themselves.

-The Ubersynths are contacted but the portal is ultimately closed... but so what? Why can't/don't they just open a portal from their side? As far as they're concerned some younger Synths are in dire need of their help.
 
-The Ubersynths are apparently really every bit as demonic as they appear... a better twist would have been if they were benevolent.

**Soong**

The new Soong sibling would have worked better as the original Noonian Soong in holographic record form (a la TNG), or as an android version, or even as himself (i.e. cured of his original terminal illness and kept alive with future medicine).

Also, Soong has a recording of Sutra killing the other Synth... and instead of just broadcasting it to the entire colony he has to sneak up and deactivate Sutra?

**In Summation**

PIC, like DSC, has a lot of squandered potential so far IMHO. This is true of every Trek, especially in their early seasons, but that shouldn't be an excuse. 

That said, fingers crossed that the new series find their footing like their predecessors!",startrek,RedKing85,False,/r/startrek/comments/ha87up/review_of_star_trek_pic/

53,Finally got around to watching Discovery and...,1592325507,"... it wasn't *that bad*.

Overall, it kept pretty true to the Trek I recognize. It didn't have that ""dystopian / dark"" tone I was always hearing about. For example, there were plenty of moments with those idealistic speeches about Starfleet values that accompany morally-challenging situations, and optimistic approaches to seemingly hopeless ones. 

There were times when the writing and plot were a bit clumsy. Especially towards the end of S2. The pacing was disjointed because they kept interrupting the main plot with a bunch of conversations, such as that montage of people's goodbye letters and all the romantic sub-plots. It seems almost every main character stopped in the middle of a high-paced emergency to have a deep and emotional  personal interaction of some kind. And I don't know what it's called when the camera moves in a circle around a group of people but that got dizzyingly annoying. 

Though, much of this can be ascribed to the same hurdle that every series has to overcome in its early seasons; They all take time to find a groove - in large part due to the need for character development. Now that I've seen it for myself, I'm having a difficult time remembering very much criticism that actually holds and I'm unable to make sense of its reputation. At this point, I don't see any reason for the ""nu-Trek"" category besides release date.

A few years ago I embarked on a journey to watch everything that Star Trek had to offer. It started with a few episodes of Discovery which reminded me I didn't know nearly enough about anything. I went back to the beginning and watched TOS and ST Continues (which I knew was not canon but it was worth it). I then watched all of the movies featuring TOS cast. I moved on to TNG which I have fond memories of watching on television as a child. From TNG I watched the movies featuring the TNG cast and then moved on to DS9, VOY, ENT and back to DIS. 

For nearly 18 months, I watched Star Trek every single day. After it was all over I realized just how much I loved DS9 more than the rest. 

After a pretty lengthy break I decided to restart DS9 and I gotta say it is so much better the second time around. Knowing where the characters will end up and watching them get there over 7 seasons is such a joy to behold. Watching Sisko get pinned on his fourth pip and finally shaving his head was pretty enjoyable as well. 

I am catching things I missed the first time and really enjoying the whole experience quite a bit. I have long known that Sisko was my  favorite of the Captains and now I get to relive why.

67,“The Tholian Web” - First Time Viewing Reaction,1592309233," Noob Trek 64 - The Tholian Web

It seems Starships aren’t the titans I initially thought - we’ve had quite a few episodes open with the discovery of a lost starship. However, it’s effective because I always wonder what exactly could take out one of these, and it indicates a fairly major threat is on the way. However, the real threat isn’t the space madness disease thing which we’ve also seen before, nor is it the intriguing Tholians and their web on which more later- it’s that this episode does something new that I didn’t expect from the show, a Kirk lite story. The threat this time is the crew carrying on without their captain.

We’ve seen Kirk lose control or be separated from his crew before, but we’ve always kept tabs on him, taken his perspective. This time he’s just gone, we don’t know where he is, and the episode subsequently shines a spotlight on the Spock and McCoy dynamic, and it’s a daring move to take this love/hate relationship which is usually played for laughs and threaten to break the crew apart with it. I feel this episode would’ve worked even better in Season 1 when we didn’t know Spock and Bones so well and might’ve found even more tension in their falling out. Nevertheless it still works very well here, with an impressively infuriatingly impassive performance from Nimoy while McCoy seethes with a conflict between his emotions and his duty.

Getting on to the actual story, I was SO excited to see the crew use safety gear I almost fainted. For once they’re taking precautions before charging aboard the derelict lifeless glowing green spaceship. I love these adorably dorky rounded rectangle helmets and hope someone has made them as action figures. However, things soon return to the usual safety norms as Kirk asks the guys to split up and wander around alone in the ship where everyone has mysteriously died. My initial suspicion that we are finally about to see a Trek take on Alien (OMG SOMEONE TELL ME THERE’S AN ACTUAL ALIEN/STAR TREK CROSSOVER COMIC OR SOMETHING) is way off, as the ship has been struck with some bizarre weapon that disrupts its dimensional presence or something, and fades into another plane of existence periodically. (This is quite a cool idea, but the science used to explain it is fairly cod. However, properly explaining this in a technically sound way may have been more trouble than it was worth.) They all beam back aboard the Enterprise and surprise of surprises, Kirk doesn’t make it. I fold my arms and wait for a cut to Kirk trapped in the Dimension of the Busty Green Ladies and it’s quite some time before it dawns on me that this isn’t happening and we’re really stuck without him.

And now the Tholians. What an interesting alien design! They appear to be sentient gem stones or something, which is fascinating and explains their preoccupation with geometry. They’re also unusually reasonable when Spock asks for time, and the titular web, though it ends up not doing much and is wildly impractical as a weapon, is a really neat idea and looks great. In fact even though this episode is good as it is, I was a little disappointed that almost no time is spent developing the Tholians or going into the precise nature of the web, they seemed to have more potential than most generic alien races we encounter.

Anyway, while the Tholians play Qix, things are developing aboard the Enterprise. I’m shocked to see Spock declare Kirk dead - not because I think for one second that Kirk is dead, but because I’m used to these shows doing an “He’s alive I just know it” sort of thing. This is important though, because it’s the realisation that Jim isn’t making it out of this one that sets McCoy off and makes him such a dick towards Spock. It also made me giggle when the guy suddenly goes nuts during the service, that would make a great out of context clip. It’s also cute when they sit down to watch Jim’s video and find that even from beyond the grave, Kirk knows best and has anticipated the problems Spock and McCoy will have.

The scene where Uhura sees Kirk in her mirror is pretty weird and unless I wasn’t paying attention, these apparitions of Kirk are never explained, but I got a laugh out of them. I honestly found this a little hard to follow - there’s a bit of gobbledygook flying around to explain what exactly is going on with interspace and dimensional disturbances and how teleporting Jim back works. I got the broad picture, but was fuzzy on some details, but I get the feeling the writer was too. But it all pays off in a tiny but super significant moment when McCoy, for the first time, calls Spock “Captain”, something he pointedly hadn’t been doing up to that moment, an acknowledgement that even though they won’t have to do without Kirk, they could if they had to - they’re more than just that one man and have realised their own strengths and capabilities. It was great for Shatner to cool his jets for one episode and let this moment happen - for a while I feared Spock would screw everything up all to hell and Kirk would turn up and push the “save Enterprise“ button and deliver a patronising speech.

McCoy and Spock slip back into their old ways with some nice banter as Spock remarks that difficulties arrive when humans are involved and McCoy says “yes when they’re involved with Vulcans.” But wait, Spock lies about having seen Kirk’s video - I thought Vulcan’s can’t lie?

A good little episode. The plot doesn’t quite hold together if I start to ask questions but this is about the character dynamics and in that regard it is quite successful. A bit different from the usual, with some nice acting and interesting ideas.",startrek,Kayfim20,False,/r/startrek/comments/ha2py7/the_tholian_web_first_time_viewing_reaction/

72,Latest episode of The Sanctuary podcast - 003: Adam &amp; Karl,1592298996,"New on my podcast network #WeMadeTreks

#TheSanctuary 003 - ‘Adam &amp; Karl’

Smithian &amp; Marxian Star Trek &amp; economics.

In the late 18th century, British thinker Adam Smith cemented himself in history as the first true 'economist', developing theories about personal capital that helped define the Industrial Revolution and the Western world's steady march toward a capitalist society. A century later, Karl Marx prescribed a different solution to human capital, one that spawned an entire economic 'religion' that morphed, at different times and different places, into forms of communism and socialism as we approached the age Star Trek was born. By the time the series launched, Smith &amp; Marx's theories had shaped much of the 20th century.

In this episode, host Tony is joined by Jason Barr, a professor of economics at Rutgers University in Newark, and the writer of an article for StarTrek.com called 'Smith, Marx, and... Picard?: Star Trek and Our Economic Future', which breaks down the key principles of how Smith and Marx influenced so-called 'Trekonomics' and Gene Roddenberry's vision of a future where money does not exist. We expand on his piece, discussing key principles of how Star Trek engages with capitalist ideals.

What exactly *is* economics? How does Star Trek exist as a 'post-scarcity' society? And how far are we away from such a future in 2020?

76,"""Cogenitor"" and ""Similitude"": I feel like Archer is losing me.",1592280220,"In ""Cogenitor,"" Archer decides to befriend this irrelevant alien race, so he invites the crews to hang out with each other. Trip finds out that this species has three genders, and the third gender (needed for reproduction) is treated like property/animals despite having equal mental facilities to the others. They're entirely under government control, can't receive education, and are expected to remain silent in public (and are almost never taken out in public). Trip is bothered by this and decides to try to make friends with the one member of this gender on the ship. He wants to understand the situation, but he also senses injustice and wants to see if he can give the cogenitor access to more knowledge (such as reading, etc).

The cogenitor is a fast learner, and soon comes to believe that its situation is extremely unjust. People find out what Trip has been up to. Archer is apoplectic because Trip is ruining his super important friendship with this sexist species of aliens. The cogenitor requests asylum on Enterprise because it does not feel that life would be worth living in the traditional way. Archer turns it down. Shortly afterward, the cogenitor kills itself, and Archer directly blames Trip for this, to his face. Because he encouraged a slave to believe that there might be more to life than slavery.

I understand that in space, you sometimes have to pick your battles. Trip rushed into this situation without thinking about what the outcome might be for the cogenitor, and without realizing that it would probably not have a happy ending. However, Archer's attitude towards Trip and the cogenitor was horrible and uncompassionate. If he wants to be friends with these aliens so bad, why doesn't he try to come up with a compromise, since they're already in this bad situation? Shouldn't these aliens show as much respect for Earth beliefs as humans should show for theirs? Better yet, why does anyone care if Enterprise is friends with this bunch of no-name slavers who will never be seen again, when Archer's openly made an enemy of the Klingon Empire?

That's right, just three weeks ago he was unjustly sentenced to life imprisonment by the Klingon Empire. Of course, Archer cares more about humanity's relationship with a powerful race of aliens, than justice for any one person. So if he can't win his appeal, he just takes the sentence for the greater good, right? At least the Klingons will know humans are honorable and respect their customs?

Lolno, he openly gets busted out of prison, angering the Empire so much that they're sending bounty hunters out to get him and ships to hunt Enterprise down, completely jeopardizing humanity's relationship with a larger, more powerful galactic power. Do I understand why Archer did this? Yes. Is this incredibly hypocritical? Yes.

I've ranted enough about that, so I'll just explain the plot of Similitude: Archer and Phlox create a rapidly aging clone of Trip, which will have a 15 day lifespan, and has all Trip's memories, in order to give Trip a brain cell transplant. Archer creates a sentient being without any possibility of it having a good life, only to kill it. When the clone finds out what he is (they don't even originally tell him), and that there's a possibility of extending his lifespan instead of donating his cells to Trip, Archer threatens to personally kill him if he doesn't comply.

I really liked the guy in season 1, but the more the show goes on the more shit like this seems to happen. I'm not saying these are *bad* episodes--in fact, they're well-conceived, well-written, and well-acted--but I just wish someone were actually calling Archer out on his bullshit.",startrek,NorfolkTerrier,False,/r/startrek/comments/h9w76l/cogenitor_and_similitude_i_feel_like_archer_is/

78,I have an Idea for a new Star Trek Series...Hear me out...Star Trek: Anthology,1592278983,"The format of this Star Trek show would be kind of like Black Mirror.  Each episode would be it's own independent story within the Star Trek Universe/MultiVerse, with a completely different set of actors, setting, and story.

There are so many stories that could be told in 60 to 120 min episodes that could be completely unique and true to Star Trek canon.  Everything from the fallout of the Bell Riots, to the Eugenic Wars, to the 100 years it took humanity to go from Zephram Cochran to the Enterprise NX-01.  Not to mention things like the disbanding of the Federation in the 31st century, as well as stories like ""Lower Decks"" or the video game Star Trek: Borg.

Star Trek is a gigantic universe just waiting for some great writers to dig in and tell some amazing stories that can all stay true to canon.  In my opinion, any writer that says Star Trek has too much canon to take into account is just be lazy and unimaginative.

85,"Long Time Star Trek Fan Finally Watches DS9: Season 4, episodes 19-21",1592269574,"I’m going to be honest I did not want to watch this show today after watching Hard Time last night. I was pretty upset and it was pretty hard to shake. So I might have missed some details in episode 19 but I did pick up momentum from there.

Shattered Mirror: I don’t know if I’ve said this before but I am just not interested in these mirror universe plots. We are just Sisko is Star Fleet’s go to until they ask him not to interfere and then he just can’t help it! We kidnapped your kid to lure you here- although it turns out you would have helped us if we had asked nicely... whoops. I just feel like it’s the same thing over and over again. They get stuck and need Sisko to come lead the resistance, although I’m not convinced the resistance is going to be any less brutal than Cardassian/Klingon overlords there. Especially not with mirror Julian in charge. It’s not working for me.

The Muse: I like this. I like writer Jake although he reminds me of myself at that age and you do NOT want to read anything I wrote, pretty much ever but especially then. So it’s a little awkward. But I thought it was kind of a cool plot. I also enjoyed having the second plot to the episode. I like them better like this- they’re usually less aggressive and fighty, they don’t follow the same pattern, and we see more characters. But why... WHY DO WE HAVE TO KEEP BREAKING ODO’S HEART? We can’t let Odo be happy! And speaking of Kira’s boyfriend, where has he been? I’m not sure Odo would have been complete with Troi’s mom, but he could have been happy. And I’m really not sure they’re going to him have Kira ever. He was so ready to be a dad for some reason! Also just as a side note, how many husbands has mom Troi had? In general I had fun with this episode. My heart still breaks for Odo but in that fun tv way. 

For The Cause: I was planning to ask you guys what happened to Dukat’s kid in this post cuz I thought Kira was supposed to be looking after her. I found her! I’m totally unsurprised about Kasidy. I didn’t like her in the first place. She felt stereotypical to me, in a way that Kira and Dax very much do not. Not stereotypically feminine, but stereotypically trying not to be feminine. It was just a cutout love interest for Sisko and not what I’ve come to expect from the characters on this show. And you know, of COURSE she was carrying medical supplies because we couldn’t hurt Sisko too badly. If she were smuggling weapons, it would have just ruined him and we can’t have that, now can we? (/s) To be fair, a lot of Sisko’s trauma comes from his past which is very relevant to the show. We’ve just done some very mean things to some of the other characters lately. Actually, I guess he did have to watch his wife die a second time in the mirror universe. So scratch that. But I do think the writers were trying to tone down her offense so Sisko would be more conflicted and I thought that was kinda boring. We’ve seen characters chose between duty and love interests before. I would have been way more entertained if he had been standing there waiting for her with security already prepared to arrest her. Maybe she even transports away!! And come on we knew that Star Fleet dude was on the wrong side episodes ago, but especially when he had no opinion on the maquis and was “Just following orders.” No high ranking officer in charge of a mission has no opinion on the risks to that mission. 

No but seriously is anyone else a little creeped out that Garak is dating Dukat’s young daughter? Also now is a good time for us to have a Garak discussion. I feel like we know WAY too much about him now for any of it to be true. Did he kill Dukat’s father? Maybe. Is that why Dukat hates him? I doubt it. Although the cardassian family structure doesn’t make a load of sense to me. Family is critical unless they do something you don’t like and then we yeet them off onto a space station. Is Dukat half Bajoran or something? It seriously cannot be as simple as “He was a spy for the obsidian order who killed an important Gal’s father.” Because nobody in the obsidian order like him either.

Since Q is omnipotent, I think you could read the scene as him referencing real life, where Star Trek is just a television show.

10,Finally watched TNG movies,1592238068,"Bonjour, mes amis! Yep, that's me again, lol 😊

So, during the weekend I watched the TNG movies and I don't even know where to begin, lol. Beware of SPOILERS below!!! 

Generations: Such a turndown for me. At first, I was so happy to see Kirk, Chekov and Scotty again! But as the plot went on and the TNG crew appeared, it started to feel like something was not right. Picard was simply... not Picard? Ok, his brother and nephew died but what the hell was all that crying with Deanna? It seemed so out of character! Data installed the emotion chip and it was so over, jfc. So much anticipation for that and it felt 100% cringey. The villain was average, almost boring. The photograph of the movie is so dark and awful. In general, it seemed like a really long episode from S1 - and not a memorable one. The only thing good about it was the interaction between Kirk and Picard but mostly because of the actings of Shatner and Stewart not the text itself. 

First Contact: The Best One. Actually, the ONLY good one. Beautifully directed and the writing was good. It felt like a really TNG vibe. The Borgs plot always scared me for some reason - I had nightmares about it - and it was nice to see it explored again. Lily and Cochrane were good additions to the story. Absolutely would watch again.

Insurrection: Not Great. Not that Bad. Just emotionless. It seemed like a really long episode from S1 again. I don't know what to comment because it was so 'meh'. 🥱 

Nemesis: I wish I could erase it from my mind. It's not only bad, it's the WORST STAR TREK MOVIE EVER. A Picard clone? Really? When he was 'revealed' I just couldn't stop laughing, lol. I kept thinking ""Oh, that guy is simply not a Picard clone, but his face is kinda familiar. Maybe there's some plot twist."" Then I found out it was Tom Hardy and my mind was filled with !?!?!?!?!?!? WHAT'S GOING ON HERE !?!?!?!?!?. Only a great actor like Stewart to have the capacity to show some emotion in such horrendous writing. Deanna being violated again for narrative purpose? Are you kidding me? I couldn't even be sad with Data's death because I was so bitter with the movie already. Bitter and angry. I imagine what it was like to have watched this when it was released. I guess I would just have felt like I did when I watched The Rise of Skywalker: just kept thinking it was some sort of parody because no way they would let that be canon. 

In general, TNG movies are not great imo. First Contact was the only movie I felt like a continuation of the tv show and I'll watch again someday. Besides a few good scenes, the other movies are just forgettable. But hey, at least I can complain about them now, right? LOL 😅

Anyways, I got into the mood and I'll watch the newest movies again too because now I feel like I can notice some stuff I didn't realized before.

I'm basing my ""rating"" on very small everyday things. I know starfleet is a military institution but the uniforms the officers wear are damn tight. Everyone's so lean and fit, super well maintained bodies, narrow waistlines and all that. Not just a few of the characters but everyone on the show was like that.

This sorcery is the fact that I am totally going to miss a day or two later in the week when I have work.

I tried writing these as I watched the episode so I would forget less details. Tell me if it helped.

Rules of Engagement: I honestly found the intro disturbing. Jadzia’s demeanor on stand doesn’t make sense to me. She IS an expert in Klingon Martial Arts. The way I know her, she should have sat there confidently and said, “Yes, he give that final order on the holosuite because he’s an expert officer dedicated to executing the program correctly. In Star Fleet exercises, he executes his Star Fleet training perfectly.” Ah, Chief O’Brien, caving under pressure. Sisko in Worf’s quarters is one of the few moments of his that I like. Especially “You’ll wish you had gone into Botany.” That said, I think Sisko is wrong(ish) on two fronts. First, I think it was actually SISKO’S mistake that Worf took command of that ship. It’s not Worf’s mistake for taking it- Worf has chosen Star Fleet and his Star Fleet training at every fork in the road. He had no reason to doubt himself this time. He wasn’t not ready. And second, I don’t actually think Worf was wrong for firing on that ship. He wasn’t just doing that for him and his ship as Sisko implied. He had a ship full of plague medicine to protect, and war ships were unlcoking, firing, and cloking again. He had, in my opinion, every reason to fire on that ship. But I still loved Sisko’s conviction. He felt believable.

Hard Time: oh man we’re only a few minutes in and this feels brutal. How is Julian simultaneously the most sensitive and insensitive person I can possibly imagine? From, “Don’t worry. We took into account all these little details for you,” to “Oh yeah, that must have sucked.” That alien in there with him is terrifying. I like that Julian’s identity was first doctor, then friend. It’s an interesting reminder of both who Julian is as an individual, but also that he was trying to be what Mile’s needed at the time, first and foremost. Julian is still a doctor without Miles. But he is not a friend. Guys I’m going to be totally honest with you. I think this is an amazing episode, but I wish I hadn’t seen it. It was in this case unfortunately very well done in my opinion. I don’t actually know what else to say. I could praise Sisko again, I liked his decisiveness. But my heart sort of sunk when he saw the weapons locker and hasn’t unsunk. It just feels kind of brutal.

The problem with Wesley is that his being a boy genius makes him utterly unrelatable to actual kids. Jake Sisko was a great example of how to actually have a kid in a show who is normal. It doesn’t help that in the first season Wesley calls his mother “mother” like a Victorian aristocrat. It’s as if they wanted to include a teenager character but have no memory of what it’s like to actually be a teenager.

But I do think Mads Mikkelsen could have and I am curious if anyone else agrees with me. For those wondering he played Hannibal Lector in the Hannibal TV series.

When Sisko tries to get to Jake's body, the officers beat him to the point where he spends several weeks healing. There's a point in the episode where Bashir tells Sisko to just stay calm to which Sisko says something like, ""Calm?  Calm never got me a damn thing!!""

But I have a theory to why DSC's visual effect is difference from TOS and TAS. Most people says that DSC is in an alternate timeline but. I think **actually TOS and TAS is the alternate timeline**. But why? The answer is simple, in TOS and TAS, there is very little, if no touchscreen. But you see, even today's spaceship, like the Crew Dragon, have lots of touchscreen. And if you look at ENT, they have quite a bit of touchscreen, so, it'd make sense that DSC have a primarily touchscreen based display. And you know what? TOS and TAS is the only series that have no touchscreen. The rest (ENT, TNG, VOY, DS9, even trek movies.) have touchscreen. And for the ""In the 23rd century have no replicator and holodeck"" problem? The answer is one, that's not a replicator, in the TAS episode ""The Practice Joker"", there is a voice based food slot and a holographic room called ""Rec Room"", and on the USS Discovery, it is an experimental vessel so, it makes sense for new technology to be tested on her.

75,"Long Time Star Trek Fan Finally Watches DS9: season 4, episodes 14-16",1592136758,"The Sons of Mogh: I liked this episode a lot. There were lots of little details to it that I really enjoyed but I subsequently forgot all of them (except this one- Jadzia had her hair tied back the same way Worf did when they were training in the holosuite). I love that Dax is an expert in pretty much anything Klingon, and that they often accept her into what they’re doing, like how Worf is willing to train and debate with her. I also loved how Dax is wholeheartedly aware of the ritual Worf was performing on his brother and its significance, but chose her human Star Fleet values over that. The ethics of that choice could be debated, but I was really excited when she unambiguously made a decision. She felt bad about it, but it was the right choice. I also love the message of this episode that there is always an alternative to violence. I felt like that message was broad and overarching in TNG (and also Doctor Who although honestly not recently) and I feel like I personally grew up and derived a lot of my own sense of morality from that idea. DS9 hasn’t stuck to it as well but their episodes also tend to deviate from a structure that invites that.

Also, between this episode and the next episode, we finally have CONSEQUENCES FOR CHARACTER ACTIONS!!!

The Bar Association: you guys got me again, this was kind of fun. I still hated quark but I was so happy for Rom when he joined the station as an engineer (or technician or whatever it was- the point was he stopped working for Quark). I also live for the scenes with Miles and Julian coming out of the holosuite. And again, we had consequences for actions! Although Miles knows Worf, so I don’t know why on earth he thought it would be a good idea to call him out in the first place. And I think it’s hysterical that Miles and Worf got in a fight, Julian was the only one who got hurt, and Julian still got to spend the night in a cell with them...

Accession: we got some Bajoran politics!!! Overall I enjoyed this episode. But one thing that I didn’t like that really stood out to me is that Sisko didn’t want to be the emissary until he decided that he knew what’s best for Bajoran people and could only influence that if he were the emissary. So it felt a little arrogant and self important. Obviously I also think that the caste system was a terrible idea and something had to be done but as far as Star Fleet’s non interference policy.... we’re way out here. I think Kira used her faith as an excuse not to do anything when she was actually in a decent position to have some sort of influence. I always struggle a little bit to understand religious anything but... he could have told her to drink poison and she would have. I have a lot to learn about faith. But I still love all the little details about Bajoran history and politics. Of course Winn supports the caste system. The mention of an old caste system and how they had to “give it up” for the occupation was interesting. Would it have been overthrown at some point, especially with outside influence? Who knows? And the comparison to Star Fleet ranks was also interesting. I agree with Kira, that rank is earned and not assigned, and you can move up and down with some effort (or ya know... lack of effort...) but it’s still worth considering to me.",startrek,MrPotato2753,False,/r/startrek/comments/h8sqot/long_time_star_trek_fan_finally_watches_ds9/
76,“For The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky” - First Time Viewing Reaction,1592136669,"Noob Trek 63 - For The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky

Ah, it’s time for the episode with THAT title. I’m rather curious to see what it’s about, and I learned not to judge a book by its cover last time, as I thought “Day Of The Dove” was a lame title yet I ended up really liking that episode. Maybe I’ll be similarly pleasantly surprised this time.

NOPE.

WARNING: Angry rant now begins. We’re talking Alternative Factor levels of snark. If you’re not interested, get out now.

I'm sorry, maybe I’m way out of line here, but I hated this. It was worse than Spock’s Brain. I’ve never heard anything about this episode before, so I apologise if it‘s well-regarded and my disdain for it upsets people, but I have to be honest. (Forget The Wrath Of Kahn - I fear The Wrath Of Fans.) It was nonsensical, boring, artificial, silly, cheesy, I just didn’t like it at all.

It’s a shame too because we’ve just had three episodes in a row I really liked - Is There In Truth No Beauty, Spectre Of The Gun, and Day Of The Dove were all well crafted, entertaining, imaginative pieces. This is a half-baked rehash of The Paradise Syndrome which manages to be even worse than that already not-great episode, without even the unintentional laughs of Spock’s Brain. This joins The Alternative Factor and The Omega Glory in the “oh dear” category.

So why did I dislike it so much? I don’t even know where to begin, I’m getting a headache thinking about it. Something’s off right from the beginning when we get two entirely unrelated stories in the cold open. Missiles are being fired at the Enterprise and McCoy has a terminal illness. There’s no cohesion between these two scenes, and this sense of carelessness will continue throughout the rest of this poorly written episode. Why were missiles fired at the Enterprise? We don’t know, it’s never mentioned again. How did McCoy contract this disease, what is it, what does it do? Nope, no detail at all. Dreadful writing throughout right up until the scene which had me cry “OH FOR CRYING OUT LOUD” at the TV. I was already unimpressed with the anti climactic way in which Spock turned off the death trap and the evil computer and saved the planet by just PUSHING A BUTTON, but then it gets worse - on the way out of this room, Spock glances at a computer and instantly knows that the Fabreze people have vast medical knowledge that could cure McCoy’s condition. WHAT? This is insulting, I’d expect better from a kids after-school cartoon. And then McCoy just gets on the ship and leaves his NEWLY WED WIFE because...? I don’t know, he just said he needed to leave to find a cure and he found one but then left anyway? And I usually avoid spoilers but was so incensed by this I looked it up and yep, she’s never mentioned in the show again. This is awful writing.

Which brings us to the nadir of the episode, Natira’s instant lady boner for McCoy. “Hello sickly man 20 years older than me who I met five minutes ago, please marry me and rule over my people.” It’s absolutely baffling. This is the worst love story I’ve seen in TOS so far and that’s saying something, though I will admit it was slightly redeemed by the mind-boggling moment when it is declared that to be her mate, McCoy will have to agree to the “insertion of the instrument of obedience.” As George Takei would say, “OH MY.” But every time these two were together I wanted to look at the ceiling and grit my teeth. It was totally unearned and false and saccharine and came out of nowhere.

The acting feels off too. The scene at the end where the oracle is baking our heroes alive is performed with no sense of urgency at all and as a result is flat and lifeless. This sense of the actors being disengaged echoes throughout the episode, perhaps best seen in Kirk’s comically casual declaration “He just suddenly screamed in pain and died.” It feels poorly directed too - did no one notice the glaring clash between Kirk and Spock discussing how no one knows they’re on a spaceship IMMEDIATELY before Natira says they are travelling to a new planet? And why does the oracle want to kill people anyway? Why is it so critical they not know they’re travelling? They can’t do any maintenance work on a ten thousand year journey? And why do their surface structures look like spam? And why are the asteroid inhabitants all dressed like Crazy Quilt’s henchmen?

And I’m still thinking about the gripping finale. “The heat will kill us, what do we do?“ “Push those three buttons here, now look up something in an index, now go over here and push another button, then work through that door and push two more buttons.“

Urgh. So much for my reputation for being mild after saying Spock’s Brain and And The Children Shall Lead weren’t that bad. Well, at least after an episode like this it’s pretty much guaranteed that the next one will be better.",startrek,Kayfim20,False,/r/startrek/comments/h8spyo/for_the_world_is_hollow_and_i_have_touched_the/

84,Seska is proof that Cardassians are reptilian,1592110494,"Certainly one of the weirder bits in early Voyager is how Seska's Cardassian physiology starts manifesting itself again after she leaves Voyager. The show never really explains WTF let this happen and it doesn't seem possible - were she altered to simply cover up her Cardassian features, her face would be huge, leaving her looking like Odo. The same problem is encountered with the Raymond Boone impostor on DS9.

So the only logical option is that they simply had these features cut off, the skin healed, and then had their skin tones changed. There's no other way they could have looked the way they did as human/Bajoran impostors. So, I submit that Cardassian physiology allowed Seska to regenerate those removed features, much like how a lizard can grow back its tail, and sometimes whole limbs.

Seska's bizarre half-Bajoran half-Cardassian look we see in her final appearances suggests she is not finished regenerating. The features are not simply emerging from under the skin, they are noticeably smaller/less prominent than those of other Cardassian women like Natima Lang, the scientists from ""Destiny"", and Chief Archon Makbar, all of whom were pretty much on par with Cardassian males. Even if through some ridiculous 24th century technology Seska were able to simply ""hide"" her features without removing them, that still doesn't explain the size difference in features.

TLDR my theory is that Cardassians can regenerate elements of their bodies, at least the facial and neck features, because of the really bizarre way Voyager portrayed Seska",startrek,WardenKultax,False,/r/startrek/comments/h8njgc/seska_is_proof_that_cardassians_are_reptilian/

This is a list of every episode (or film) in which the episode's title is mentioned, usually in narrative dialogue but occasionally in voice-overs or displayed on screen. If a title is dropped within a recap, it is not counted.

The format below lists each episode and the characters who say the title at least once. If the drop is not an exact match -- ""a"" instead of ""the"", or plural instead of singular -- it is specified in the parentheses. If there are both exact and inexact drops within an episode, I counted only the exact drops and ignored the inexact. 

The source of this data is, of course, chakoteya.net, by far my most-used resource for all things Trek other than M-A itself. Generally speaking the minor characters are identified the way chakoteya identifies them...I did no research to confirm their names. If I missed something because of a typo, take it up with them.

chakoteya does not have transcripts for any material past DIS S1. I found a few raw captioning transcripts on another site, but they were incomplete and contained no character information, so to bring this project up to date one would have to rewatch the newest seasons. I'm not that invested. However, based on that incomplete data and my own memory, I can say that

Brother (Burnham and either Pike or Una)  
New Eden (probably a few characters)  
Project Daedalus (Airiam)  
The Red Angel (Burnham and probably other characters)    

The Girl Who Made the Stars (Mike)  

Absolute Candor (Picard and one or two other characters. This is not included in Picard's total.)  
Nepenthe (maybe)  

These are the character counts for **exact matches only**. The totals are by number of episodes, *not* by individual drop (in other words, a character might say the title a dozen times *within* an episode), but it's only counted as one occurrence. I made an effort to distinguish between different versions of a character (i.e. Thomas Riker saying ""Defiant"" and the backup EMH saying ""living witness"" don't count in the totals) but there may have been cases of a character being possessed by another entity that I missed. The list is regular and recurring characters only, but is not exhaustive.

I just re-watched these episodes because current events brought them to mind. While Part 1 is mostly setup, and there are some really unnecessary and silly ""filler scenes"", the events of ""The Bell Riots"" in Part 2 are really well done, and the episode tackles some real issues.  SOLID performance from Avery Brooks. I was also really struck by Dick Miller's performance. His eventual change of heart could of easily come off as trite, but it was really moving.

I looked up his Wikipedia page after watching and , holy shit! What a career this guy had (he passed away last year at age 90 from natural causes).  He was in every film directed by Joe Dante,  and in many produced by Roger Corman. He also managed to get a PHD in Psychology on the side.

However, as Bob Justman remembers, writing those famous words was not a simple task.**

When we last saw those intrepid adventurers Gene Roddenberry and Bob Justman, they had successfully averted disaster and resultant ignominy — temporarily as it turned out. Despite the dire prediction that ""you'll never make your first air date,"" Gene and I had snatched victory from the jaws of defeat by hurriedly constructing our main title visuals from bits and pieces of film salvaged from both previous *STAR TREK* pilots and a ew tardy, but better late than never, new shots of the *Enterprise* in space. But even while we were solving that problem, we were handling another deadline. We faced the prospect of going on the air with an opening *STAR TREK* episode that skill lacked a major element — a romantic and poetic main title narration. What to do? What to do? Would we now snatch defeat from the jaws of victory? Or would the good guys win?

    CUT TO: Midsummer, 1966
    
    LOCATION: The Star Trek production offices on the ground floor of Building ""E"" at Desilu Studios.
    
    CAST: Gene Roddenberry, John D.F. Black, Bill Shatner, Bob Justman, and other associated overworked people.
    
    FADE IN:
    INT. RODDENBERRY OFFICE — DAY
    An overtired 'Great Bird of the Galaxy' faces his equally tired but demanding inquisitor.
    
    BOB
    (impatiently)
    How about it, Gene?
    
    GENE
    (sighs, heavily)
    Soon, Bob. I promise.
    
    BOB
    We're running out of time, Bird.
    
    GENE
    (rolls his eyes)
    I gotta finish this script! Then I'll get right on it, Bob. I promise.
    
    BOB
    (unmollified)
    You might as well 'cause I'll just keep on bugging you!
    
    Bob exits, grumbling and mittering. Gene sighs again, goes back to work. So many scripts; so little time. And not only that. He's out of #2 pencils again.
    
    FADE OUT:

For weeks I had been pushing Gene to write the sorely-needed narration, but although he know how important it was, he procrastinated — or, at least, that's what I accused him of. Now, in retrospect, I think there were other factors. One of them, and a huge one, was the heavy workload he was carrying as he worked on stories and scripts. The other factor was that he just wasn't ready to commit to something final. While he know what elements were necessary, the phraseology of what he had in mind still lacked poetry.

**Fitful start**

But tempus was fugiting, so on August 1 1966 I wrote a memo to Gene prodding him to finally write the long-awaited narration. With the seasons premier set for September 8, a little over five weeks away, we would soon run out of time. Finally forced to face the music, Gene got to work on the narration and sent his first attempt, followed a few hours later by a second version to John D. F. Black (our talented associate producer-writer) and yours truly. Gene asked both of us for our comments and contributions.

**Waiting for an answer**

We both responded immediately with suggested revisions. Hohn was the one who first came up with the idea of incorporating writer Sam Peoples' second pilot title 'Where No Man Has Gone Before.' And then everything ground to a screeching halt while we awaited a response. Not that we sat idly by, twiddling our thumbs we had shows to get out and the demands of production didn't allow for any lallygagging around. Gene was holed up in his office writing. I continued to query him, ""Gene, when will we have the narration?"" and he'd respond, as before ""Soon, Bob. Soon.""

But soon didn't arrive. Finally on August 10, 19666, after phoning him at home the previous night to warn that we had just run out of time, I sent Gene a final plea in memo form. He took my previous memo of August 2, in which I suggested revisions to his original try, and scratched some ideas at the bottom of the page, finally drafting what became Captain Kirk's famous opening narration.

**Recording at last**

That afternoon, minutes after Gene handed his final revision to me, I phoned Bill Shatner on stage and told him, ""We got the narration, Bill. Drop everything and come a'running!"" Then I dashed next door to the dubbing stage, where I already had the sound crew setting things up. Bill arrived shortly thereafter, breathing hard. We 'got a level' from hi, rehearsed several times, and went for a take. Bill's classical training stood him in good stead; his reading of the lines was superb — But after playing it back I felt disappointed. The narration didn't sound right. It seemed to lack importance.

I thought for a moment, then asked our head dubbing sound mixer, Eldon Ruberg, to add a 'reverb' effect to Bill's voice. We recorded another take and the results were perfect. Bill Shatner became Captain Kirk, the heroic starship commander of the future when he declared: ""Space … the final frontier. These are the voyages of the *Starship Enterprise*, it's five-year mission …. to explore strange new worlds … to seek out new life and new civilizations … to boldly go where no man has gone before.""

**On schedule**

Despite the dire predictions, we made our first air date on time; in fact, we made every air date on time that season, but it was the most nerve-wracking experience of my life — up to then, anyhow. (Later, my kids got older and became teenagers. And I survived that too. Just joking, guys.) We survived by the skin of our teeth, delivering each new print barely in time to go on the air. The fact that we broadcast in Canada a week ahead of the U.S. didn't help matters. There wasn't time to fly the prints to Montreal; instead, NBC transmitted them over rival network ABC's lines for broadcast that very evening across the border in Canada.

**Settling in**

Even before we got out 'pickup' for another season of *STAR TREK*, I had resolved that we'd never be put in such an untenable position again. By the time 'The Corbomite Maneuver' had aired as our tenth show of the first season, I was relentlessly campaigning for 'story money' which would allow us to get a leg up on scripts for the upcoming second season — if, indeed there was a second season.

Several months later, my efforts paid off, as a grudging NBC advanced us some bucks to help pay for stories which we had already gone ahead and put into work anyway. These stories gave us a cushion that we made full use of. (Did I end a sentence with a preposition? I did? I swear to never do it again — until next time.) Anyhow, we — and you, the audience — benefited from this strategy. We both got better shows. *STAR TREK*'s second season was, for the most part, terrifically entertaining. We had hit our stride and things were looking up — or so we thought. More on that some other time. Stay tuned, folks; there's lots more to come from the wormhole to the past, where Bob Justman, *STAR TREK*'s resident 'devil in the dark' lurks.

And as a Patreon I sure get a loooot more content than other ST pod patreon perks I pledge to. Right now for Patreon they are doing a “Bad Ass Women of Trek” series. This week was Duet. Greeeat discussion. And their live free content was “Pitch Your Trek”. THAT was amazing fun. Podcast listeners came up with shows I would watch in a heartbeat. (Check out their YouTube feed for that. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnKujWGISpl1aUXS1LT_aeA maybe they’ll do another!)

Also listening to Delta Flyers. Super fun way to rewatch Voyager along with Garrett and Robbie. One a week is too slow! Lol. Anyone else listening? You can sure tell Robbie is a director now. That angle is super educational too. 

Several trek.fm pods I enjoy, Star Trek Daily News and lately Make It So from We Made this Podcast. I disagreed a lot with the hosts on Discovery when it first aired when they spoke on other pods but I’m glad to see on their rewatch they are coming around a bit and having really interesting discussions. I guess they are going to make a new pod to shuffle those to branching out.

24,“Day Of The Dove” - First Time Viewing Reaction,1592050218,"Note: I took some time off Star Trek because of personal life/work stuff but also because for my birthday I got a pack of four sci-fi themed adventure games - Primordia, Gemini Rue, Technobabylon, and Shardlight. Though obviously not Trek related, they’re very good and the pack is highly recommended to all sci-fi gamers.

Note 2: My Trekkie dad wants you to know of his disappointment that TOS never did an episode about an alien shapeshifter that impersonates the ship’s doctor called The Real McCoy.

 Noob Trek 62 - Day Of The Dove

This title is a bit corny, but bonus points for reminding me of my favourite album cover of all time:

[https://www.discogs.com/Mike-Adkins-Thank-You-For-The-Dove/release/1331151](https://www.discogs.com/Mike-Adkins-Thank-You-For-The-Dove/release/1331151)  


It features the track “What’s Wrong With My Children?”

Anyway, getting on to the episode. Really interesting set up - a human base has been destroyed but there’s no physical trace of destruction, a mysterious being of light is lurking nearby, and there’s klingons in the area but far from being the perpetrators they seem like they’re having their own problems with their ship in ruins. Even though I recognise the familiar trope of an episode in which adversaries have to get along with each other against a common foe (day of the dove = day of peace between Federation and Klingons?) I’m still keen to see how it plays out in Star Trek. I know that in later shows the Klingons and the humans get along better so it would be cool to see that lore. Plus the Klingon makeup has changed again! It’s unfortunate that they’ve opted for blackface but at least they’re trying as opposed to The Trouble With Tribbles where the klingons just looked like some guys. But the way their leader just wordlessly marches up and bitch slaps Kirk with no context has me laughing out loud.

Interesting note about how Klingons killed Chekov’s brother, it’s about time these characters got fleshed out a bit. I also like Ansara as Kang - his cold reponse to Chekov’s “You killed my brother!” is “And you volunteer to join him. That is loyalty.” Ansara has a strong, stern voice that suits this role well. Chekov’s screams as he is tortured are actually genuinely unsettling, well played by Koenig.

Wait a second, are Kodos and Kang from The Simpsons named after Klingons from Star Trek? That’s cool, I never knew that.

I like how Scotty is able to not only seperate the landing party from the Klingons and delay their beaming aboard, but to rotate them to face the wrong way to disorient them when the security team seizes them. It also sends the episode in a different direction from what I was expecting - with Kang already subdued, what is the real threat that Kirk is going to face this episode?

I believe this is the first time we’ve seen Klingon women, interesting. The little glowing ball that’s causing all this trouble is cool too. We’ve seen shimmering light monsters before rendered with varying degrees of effectiveness, but they really seem to have got it right here. The movement is well controlled and it’s visually clear what it’s up to, plus it turns invisible very cleanly. However at some point it stops turning invisible which is rather counter to it’s plan of going unnoticed, and this is never explained, something of a plot hole. And it’s another super powerful being story but I don’t mind because having the Klingons on board and in the mix while it wreaks havoc is different and exciting. And it keeps getting more intriguing - I’m just thinking how out of character Chekov’s bloodlust is and then Sulu reveals that Chekov’s brother never existed. So what’s going on here?

The reveal shot of Scotty amidst all the swords in the armoury is hilarious. McCoy’s transformation is handled well too. I thought something was off when he engaged in bigotry in the elevator early on, and it turns out they were planting seeds for the emotional manipulation of the light ball. I also like how the Klingons are being played as assholes (listen to enjoyment in Kang’s voice when he says ”You will die of suffocation in the cold icy loneliness of space) when they could have gone for the “we‘re all the same, kumbayah“ approach. The fact is that although the Klingons aren’t responsible for \*this\* villainy, they are quite capable of villainy and that non-equivalence of morality and values between the two sides gives the episode more tension. It’s a lot harder to put aside differences against a common foe when your enemy really is your enemy rather than someone you merely misunderstood, as is usually the trope for this type of story.

When even level-headed Spock is giving into the madness, you know it’s serious. Kirk’s line “Even race hatred?” is also very poignant. It’s not intention to be political here, but I can’t help but be aware that I write this post on a reddit that right now has a “Star Trek reddit stands against racism” post stickied to the top, and it hurts to think that 52 years on from the creation of this episode, the race hatred Kirk reviles still isn’t a thing of the past. Was this episode another Vietnam war allegory?

Amid a very tense episode, there’s still some laughs. “Nothing’s responding” Sulu cries as the power immediately comes back on. Yet the laughter dies when lovable Chekhov suddenly gets rapey with Mara. “You don’t die... yet.” And the closeups on their faces. Brrrrrr. Koenig is handling this well, he’s grown as an actor. On the one hand I can applaud how adult the show is being; the characters are being driven to extreme attitudes of warlike behaviour, and abuse of enemy women is a sad reality of warfare. On the other it feels a bit too dark for this context. It’s a bit rich for Kirk to save her, judging by his conduct in past episodes I half expected Kirk to take Chekhov’s place.

It’s a shame that Mara is spending all this screen time standing silently around glaring. They’re wasting an opportunity to flesh out the Klingon race by developing our first on-screen Klingon female into a meaningful character. I also don’t like these scenes where Kirk and Spock explain the plot, which we’ve had a few of lately.

Ooh, inter-ship travel, that’s neat, I had wondered why we’d never seen them try that before. Another quite adult moment as  Kang suspects Kirk of banging Mara. Was this sort of content dicey when broadcast? Btw, we have a Vulcan/human child in Spock, do we ever see a human/Klingon person? Man, the foley guy went bananas on this sword fight. Two swords connect, and we get the sound of someone putting an anvil in a cement mixer.

Some interesting parallels with Balance Of Terror. Almost an inversion of that episode, where Kirk and his admirable foe, not so different, guided by a different set of principles are separated across the gulf of space. Here they’re right in each other’s faces, and there’s some similar philosophical territory being explored.

As Kirk rattles off some jingoes about peace and love, Kang chimes in with ”We need no urging to hate humans”, hahaha. I love how they’re having the KlingonS stay true to character. This isn’t some naive brotherhood moment for the Klingons, they’re doing it for their own motives. As Kang says, “Only a fool fights in a burning house.”

Shockingly abrupt ending though, I was expecting some aftermath. I wonder what happened to Kang and Mara. Be pretty funny if, as the Enterprise sails away into the credits into a new dance of peace and understanding between races, an airlock pops open and we see all the Klingons being ejected.

Great episode. Made the Klingons great again after they seemed a bit silly in the likes of Friday’s Child and The Trouble With Tribbles. I was never bored, it kept me guessing, and lots of action and drama mixed in with moments both mature and amusing. The ultimate compliment is I did not regret taking a break from my new games to spend my evening watching this episode.

He never told the truth when he could lie.  In each of his lies, there was a thread of truth.  Plus, he was a fine tailor. I should have hated him but there is something so likable about Garak.  He is a man who cares nothing for being liked.  Even his friendship with Bashir was never really an honest one.  I think he often used Bashir as a safety in case he needed support with the Federation.  The actor who played intended for him to be asexual.  Sex is just another tool to him but the actor ended up letting that fade as he didn't feel the show was ready for it to  be spoken aloud.

He wasn't a good man but he was an interesting one. He would have been so fun to play--all the dirty little nuances.

36,Finished ST:DS9 today ! Thoughts from a new trek fan ..,1592018981,"Firstly I am no authority on Star trek's massive universe and started watching the series only recently while being holed up due to the COVID pandemic and became a fan.

All my experience with star trek began only with the James Abrams reboot. So my order of watching trek was Star Trek (2009)-&gt; Star Trek Into Darkness (2013) -&gt; Star Trek Beyond (2016) -&gt; Few random ST TOS episodes, wrath of Khan movie -&gt; Star Trek Discovery -&gt; ST:TNG -&gt; ST:TNG Movies-&gt; ST:DS9. When I watched Discovery I had no experience with any Star trek TV and I liked it very much especially S01 and didn't quite understand why many were complaining its not like star trek but now I can understand. 

I finished ST:TNG this May 1 and immediately went into DS9 based on comments from a fellow reddit user in r/scifi so I want to judge how DS9 fares against ST:TNG 

* DS9 main characters are from a diverse set of races compared to ST:TNG - Humans, Bajoran, Changeling, Klingon, Trill and a Ferengi. DS9-1, TNG-0

* Characterization - Every character was fleshed out better and had better character development than in TNG where I felt only Picard, Data and Worf had some development (still liked Riker though). Lot of depth even for side characters like Elam Garak, Nog, Rom, Dukat etc DS9-2, TNG-0

* Female characters - Both Kira and Jadzia actually had a tangible role and made a significant impact and were very likable, loved both of them. I dont know why Jadzia actress wanted to leave ? Comparing them to TNG's female characters - Crusher was just ok - just ran with a tricorder most of the time and I didn't find the character of Deana troi appealing or make a significant impact to the team compared to how vital Kira was in DS9. DS9-3, TNG-0

* Lead Character - Picard vs Sisko, hands down Picard no arguments here. Picard is the moral guardian who embodies everything Federation stands for and a better ""captain"". Sisko tries but its never to the level of Picard. Also Avery brooks acting during emotional scenes felt very artificial. DS9-3, TNG-1

* Sci fi Content - TNG had a lot of more enjoyable standalone/episodic sci fi content than DS9. DS9-3, TNG-2

* Story - I loved the long story arcs and sheer variety of themes in DS9. Characters like Dukat wouldnt be possible in TNG. Religious cults ! Genocide ! Sec 31 ! Spies ! War ! DS9-4, TNG-2

* Romance - I dont like in both, but Kassidy alone spoils it for me even if odo/kira, Dax/worf romance arcs were bearable. Not a fan of Crusher/Picard, Riker/Troi/Worf romance arcs too. O'Brien/Keiko were alright. No points for both ..DS9-4, TNG-2

* Ending - ST:TNG over DS9. DS9 had a lot of interesting threads to wrap up and I felt many were not wrapped properly whereas I felt TNG wrapped it perfectly.

1) Odo linking with the female changeling and convincing her to surrender in like a second. I know Female changeling told, Odo returning to link was more important than the entire alpha quadrant. But the scene should have been detailed a little bit more and it was just lazy writing. 

2) The pah wraiths, kai wenn, sisko vs dukat fight - all were a total bust. Dukat had an excellent arc. But the fight was painfully bad to watch. 

3) There was a lot of build up on the wormhole aliens and non linearity of time and I dont know what all that resulted too ? My understanding of them at start and end is almost the same ? What about that sorrow that was to befall on Sisko if he were to marry kasidy yates ? the previous kai told her path would cross again, did it ?

4) Did Romulans, jem'hdar cause any problems after the end of war ? 

5) I dont know why they had to thrust those ideals on the Ferengi. You dont have to make every race have the ideals of federation. The average viewer is not a idiot and doesn't need to be reminded about equality, greed etc. Even if they wanted to do it, fine ! but it still felt rushed.

6) The montage at the end was nice but creating a tear train is not very difficult.

I would like your thoughts on the above ..

Bottom line - Numerically DS9 should be better than TNG. The show had well-developed characters, excellent dominion story line and a good Emissary/Pah wraiths/Dukat story. But i cant help but to feel it fizzled out in the end and they didn't capitalize on the excellent story and could have given an even better finale. I cant believe how DS9 with these many strengths and just Picard, Data, a better finale and higher quality episodic content for TNG would make me rate TNG higher (albeit slightly) than DS9. 

 **TNG - 10/10,   DS9 - 9/10**

I’m often shocked by how calloused and borderline cruel the crew can be toward EMH, even late in the series. I’m early in Season 6 and they still regularly crack jokes at his expense about being a lowly AI. Paris just joked about him being descended from an electric razor.

42,Long Time Star Trek Fan Finally Watches DS9: Season 4 episodes 12 and 13,1592014470,"Guys my heart constantly, CONSTANTLY breaks for Odo. It physically hurts.

Cross Fire: I feel like this episode was a little too much soap opera and not enough Bajoran politics. I’m very invested in their entrance to the federation. I think they did a very good job at portraying the hurt Odo felt. I kinda liked it when he lost his crap on his own quarters- that’s the passion I want to see from Odo and we’ve been missing it a little since the Dominion stuff picked up. But I want to go back to watching him pour that passion into saving lives. That was just so inspiring for me, I felt like I could watch it forever. I’ll admit I didn’t hate it when Quark had his heart to heart with Odo but I would have preferred it was another character. But when I tried to think of which  other character I couldn’t because the only other person he’s close with is Kira (although he did mention kayaking with Miles once). And then I realized that’s the point... what happened to his pet star fleet officer? There was also a point here where I thought he was going to get along with Worf but then he flushed that down the toilet.

Return to Grace: alright guys, WHY IS EVERYONE ATTRACTED TO KIRA??? We have Odo, Vedec Bariel, the first minister dude, those guys in the resistance she was with when fighting vedec Winn (?), Julian in that episode where Troi’s mom brought out latent attraction, some others I’m definitely forgetting, and now Gal Dukat???! Dax is MUCH more dynamic and interesting to me. We still don’t know who Kira is outside of terrorist/resistance fighter. What does a date even look like for her? “So, tell me about your hobbies.” “Well, I’m really into dismantling oppressive governments.” “Oh, funny, I would have pinned you as a pottery type of girl.” I wonder if this is because they’re trying to paint Dax as hard to get, or because Dax’s love stories are rushed, short-lived and irresponsible, but seriously everybody falls in love with Kira. And where’s Julian actually falling in love with someone? I no longer believe it should be Jadzia, because I don’t think Jadzia could love someone like Julian. But I want the world for him.

But as far as the actual episode goes... meh. There was a much more interesting plot that could have happened here, and that I THOUGHT was happening, where Dukat would try to trick Kira into giving away the secrets Worf told her not to, while Kira was distracted by Dukat’s daughter. I also just hate when characters cause unnecessary loss of life with no consequences. I think Kira just had no sympathy for the Klingons, and agreed with Dukat that he did what he had to when he suggested that’s how her resistance fought. I believe in peace and diplomacy so much that it genuinely upsets me when a fictional character rejects those methods of conflict resolution.  Are we keeping Dukat’s daughter? I think she could reveal a lot about Kira. And I was really proud of Kira when she said that this is who she was but not who she wanted to be.

She is the first main character to explore multiple personality harmonization and chaos (the entire series of Legion \[xmen series\] revolved around this)

She was the first female actress that comes from the model line fresh and actually didn't screw up sci fi theatre or had too much drama. Terry Farell played a character so deviant, so modern, so out there in a time nobody even grasp the concept of queer identity, let alone masculine feminism but she pulled it off for 6 years out of thin air.

She even had internal pacifistic racial strife between the trill and the symbiotes that question racism. 

In one character, they have managed to cover ALL the concurrently dominant social politics of 2020. Racism - George Floyd (trill treating the symbiotes as commodity), Gender Fluidity and Non-Binary-ism, Gender Inequality, Social Mental Health and Spiritual Personal Acceptance on a level that deviant from today's cultural norms.

71,"Why do Discovery characters frequently stop everything to have long, personal conversations in the middle of emergencies?",1591994942,"This has been driving me nuts, especially watching season 2.

For example, in the last episode of S2 in the middle of a pitched battle where they've told us that literally the future of all sentient life is at stake, and people are dying every second, Spock and Burnham have a leisurely 5 minute conversation about how much they mean to each other. Without any apparent thought for what's going on around them.

It's fucking infuriating.

**edit:** As it turns out, I'm not the only one to notice this. And [this writer](https://steven-erikson.org/chaos-writing-room-ongoing-clusterfuck-star-trek-discovery/) has described the problem better than I apparently have.

&gt;Now picture a story structure that ignores all of that, instead taking us headlong into that moment of great jeopardy when, with the countdown on, *everybody involved stops to talk it all out*.  What has just happened?  Well, you’ve ruined all tension, unplugged the jeopardy, slowed the pace to allow for a bunch of expositional stuff to be laid out, the dilemmas to be reconfigured (yet again), and yes, *everyone’s standing around while the ship around them tears itself apart and, quite possibly, people are dying.  While you talk it out, with perfect pauses in the vessel’s banging and shuddering, each one timed in and around the dialogue where appropriate.*

&gt;Now it may seem like I’m zeroing in on one particular writer in one particular episode, and that might lead to the wrong conclusion.  This bad structure happens all the time in ST: Discovery.  It’s why all the technobabble has to be delivered in a breathless, shouted rush.  It’s also why we’re hurried past all that technobabble as quickly as possible (because, really, it rarely makes any sense anyway).  Because explication halts the pacing.

Some may not remember, but a few weeks ago, I asked in a post if I should watch only ""The Best Of"" or the entire TNG series since there are a lot of episodes and I didn't know if I could bear to watch the whole thing. Most of you told me to watch everything, but in the end, I decided to make a list of +/- 70 episodes described as the must-see of the series. So, I started watching. By the time I reached some episodes of S5, I finally understood why most of you where telling me to watch the whole thing. I was totally hooked in the series. Then I went back and watched the episodes I skipped so I could go on chronologically. Best decision ever! Even though there were a few key things I missed and honestly believe I just could understand by context, the fun of seeing silly things portrayed was really comforting, specially in times like these where hope seems to be so unreachable. All that written, just to say that at this moment I have tears in my eyes because I just watched the series finale and it was magnificent. I'm really glad I entered this journey and specially that I've found such a welcoming place in here.

I guess in the end, I'm just feeling overwhelmingly grateful and wanted to share. ♡

Firstly, I love Enterprise, and while I consider DS9 to be the \*best\* Star Trek series, Enterprise remains my favourite. I've had a lot of success getting friends into Star Trek by starting with Enterprise and watching it through with them. 

I'm in the midst of one of those introductory watch-throughs right now, and today's episode is Regeneration. Whenever I get  to this episode, I always wrestle with how much to brief them beforehand. This episode is a bit complex to explain because of the inclusion of Borg who only arrived there after the time travel events of First Contact. I personally feel like its folly to watch First Contact without having seen Best of Both Worlds, and preferably also Q Who. So I don't really think we'll go down that TNG tangent road. 

Another option is to explain only who the borg are and they they once attemped to travel to earth's past (2063) but their ship was destroyed.

I understand that he grew up “torn between two cultures”, but that band-aid excuse for capriche shouldn’t fly for a Lieutenant. His dialogue is stilted and contrived; referring to the entire Klingon race in generalized third-person makes for awful writing, and purports that the entirety of the Klingon race are a dogmatic, reductive, and homogeneous lot. 

People don’t express themselves like “humans do not &lt;insert action&gt;”. Even Wesley sounded dumb and naïve as hell when he said “I’m with Starfleet. We don’t lie.” 

When Worf talks this way, he comes off as a bible-thumping religious zealot, bound by tradition. “It is our way!” is a ridiculous thing to say about a whole planet, even worse for a multi-planetary empire! I realize this trope occurs in other alien-races-of-the-week. But Worf is a main character, a Lieutenant in Starfleet; presumably trained to be a man of mental fortitude and capable of lucid critical thinking. I don’t suppose Starfleet Academy allowed him to slip by with such a one-track-mind simply because he was Klingon. How can a Klingon, raised by humans, in his 30s, with tactical training by a peacekeeping and exploratory armada, retain such childish notions of honor? How come everything comes down to combat? Why is he so rash and quick to attack on the Enterprise? Has Starfleet taught him nothing, or did he actively counter-program everything he was taught with his own research on Klingon traditions? 

Portraying him as stubborn zealot is a disservice to the character, painting him as someone who is incapable of grasping the concept of individuality within Klingon culture. 

Hell, even alien-character-of-the-week Timicin from Half a Life has more character development, shown to quiver in the ways of his people throughout the course of one episode. 

I hope Worf develops more, or gets less dogmatic and his dialogue becomes less cringeworthy in DS9. But then again, why couldn’t he have developed in 7 seasons of TNG?",startrek,ethestiel,False,/r/startrek/comments/h7l4mu/unpopular_opinion_maybe/

February saw the Borg return to *STAR TREK: VOYAGER* in a two-hour special. 'Dark Frontier' was a major undertaking that took us to the heart of Borg space, dealt with Seven's background, and introduced us to a new Borg Queen.

The show was actually shot as two separate one-hour episodes and the decision to show it as a two hour special was taken relatively late in the day. The first part was directed by *STAR TREK* veteran Cliff Bole, with relative newcomer Terry Windell pulling directing duty on Part II.

**Under the gun**

Cliff remembers that the production was under a lot of pressure from the get go. To make matters worse the show was filming in November and December, a period when Hollywood is notoriously busy. ""Casting was a bit of a problem; the town was awful busy then. you know, winding down before Christmas everybody's trying to get shows down, and finding the right talent was very tough. I think the original access who played Seven's mother was unavailable and working in New York, and we just had to go searching.

**Working hard**

A lot of times when they were looking, I was shooting, so that added to it. We were putting it together pretty much at the firth hour, and I had to depend on the boys upstairs to do some casting without me, because my plate was full. So, Seven's parents were cast late, because that part of the show we did towards the end, because we weren't sure how much we were going to do on it. The girl we picked for the young Seven was a real find. We lucked out but, by God, we looked; it got really tight.""

And casting was not the only problem: the writers were working long hours to produce an exceptional script, and sometimes the directors could not wait for them to finish.

""We started shooting before we had a completed script and the writers were really cranking hard. Our set designer, Richard Hames, had to pretty much put a set together without knowing the ending, and he had to build the Queen's set without knowing how the second part was going. The phone was ringing all the time; that's how Brannon and I had to work, because he was working so hard on the second part and finishing the first one. I mean he answered the phone immediately and we hammered our way through it.""

**Enter the Queen**

Most of the changes to the script were very subtle but, as Cliff explains, some important details still hadn't been clarified.

""Even before I had an ending, I begged to get the Queen in the end of my piece. Originally, they hadn't planned on it, and I said 'Guys, you can't do this. You've got to tease, and you've got to bring these folks back, and you've got to have the Queen in this episode. You've just got to have what I call the end-teaser and introduce the Queen. I don't care i it's one page or two shots; just do it.'""

Cliff did get his scene with the Borg Queen, but not straight away: ""They hadn't quite got the Queen yet, she wasn't available; so I had to come back to shoot. I had to come back after I'd finished filming, about a week later, to shoot my part with the Queen, which was just the ending \[of the first hour of the show\].""

The sequence was shot in the Queen's lair — the major new set for 'Dark Fontier.' *VOYAGER's* production designer, Richard Hames, remembers that he wanted to make it significantly different to any of the other Borg sets seen on the show.

""I wanted something different from what we've seen before, so I made the Queen's lair look as if it was a sphere. The whole set was about two stories tall and was made with all new drawings. The inside of her lair is curved to give it a spherical feel. I wasn't necessarily trying to follow the shapes used in *FIRST CONTACT;* it just kind of came out that way, and I really like the look The normal Borg walls are so square and flat that I wanted to add some depth and something real interesting. I also cut out the cylinders and made wafers instead, kind of like a large watch battery.""

**Working together**

The Queen's liar is only on green for a few minutes in the first hour of 'Dark Frontier,' but it's where most of the action in 'Part II' (which was directed by Terry Windell) takes place.

Given the time pressure, Cliff thinks that it was a blessing that there were two directors, and Treey, who had only directed his first episode of *STAR TREK* a month earlier, explains that the two men worked in unison to ensure that their scenes would cut together smoothly.

""I actually went on the set and watched what Cliff was doing so that we would have continuity. The biggest aspect was he didn't actually introduce the Queen's lair until the last act of his show and the majority of my show takes place there, so that was the big sequence we had to collaborate on, and we actually were there on the same day when he was filming his sequence.""

Cliff had plenty of experience working with the Borg — he directed 'The Best of Both Worlds' when the Borg attacked earth for the first time — but Terry had some research to do.

""Obviously, I referred to *FIRST CONTACT* and the episode where they pick up Seven. I researched about four or five episodes that were strong in Borg. The feature and 'The Gift' were probably the strongest in terms of how to handle the material, especially since one dealt with Seven's transition from Borg to becoming more human, and this whole story is about the possibility of her becoming Borg again.""

'Dark Frontier' has a lot in common with the previous Borg stories, but Terry also felt that because his part of the show focused on the Borg Queen, and on Seven's feelings about the Borg, it called for something new.

**The Queen and her drones**

""I think you have a consistency in the characterization of the Borg, the collective mind, and how they operate. Our Queen was obviously a different character; although she's still the Borg Queen, there's a very different take on it. So that's the part that I consider open territory to be different. The actual individual Borgs, I think, are manipulated very much in the same way, and that's how you keep the consistency and the continuity.

""in terms of the Queen's lair — it's something we hadn't seen before, that was a new set, so that gave us some freedom. The Borg corridors, you've seen something close to that. I tried to lens it a bit differently than I've seen before: I tried to use longer lenses and compress a lot of the space, just to get a sense of claustrophobia.

""What I've seen before a lot in the Borg corridors is wide lenses to give that kind of fostered perspective and you know, get a little disjointed, and it tends to make the set look really open and big. Once the Borg Queen orders Seven to go back in and actually participate in assimilating another race, we felt that it should be in Seven's mind's eye, what the corridor was all about. I felt it should be very claustrophobic.

""I think that what we did in the Borg corridors and the Queen's lair were more featuresque, the drama and lighting, so that it's not always about seeing everything in total clarity; it's about using light and smoke. I think that the visual effects give it the production value. When they describe the multitude of Borg vessels you have to see that.""

**The new Queen**

Susanna Thompson literally filed Alice Krige's very uncomfortable shoes as the new Borg Queen: the original Queen costume was altered slightly, but otherwise it is the same, and there were only a few changes to the makeup — Susanna wore a slightly different mechanical structure on the back of her head, with some new lights.

Despite several previous appearances on *STAR TREK*, the Borg Queen role was her first encounter with large scale prosthetics. Just getting the makeup and costume on took five and a half hours and, as she says, it's an experience she won't forget in a hurry.

""It's so bizarre to have makeup spray pained on you; it's a very bizarre feeling. I felt like I was in the shop!""

And the work was far from over when she arrived on set. ""There were adjustments to the makeup in the center of the face and the eyes, the lips of course, and the forehead. They didn't want me to look as wet as Alice, so they had to make sure that looked okay. There was always a costume maker with me to help me get out of the costume right away if I needed to go to the bathroom, and, being someone who doesn't really like to have a person constantly around me, that was a hardship.""

**The voice of experience**

Fortunately, Jeru Ryan who has plenty of experience wearing a Borg costume, was on hand to offer Susanna some valuable advice.

""We talked about character, absolutely, but some of the most important information Jeri wanted to give me was about how to lie down! I had to lie vertical, but Jeri knew that, and she had a neck pillow. What I did was, I had a mound of robes on the floor on my trailer, neck pillow on top of them, and then I was able to lie somewhat comfortably.""

Despite the discomfort, Susanna found that the makeup and costume made an enormous contribution to her performance, not least because they made it difficult to make 'extravagant' gestures.

""I found the costume, probably because it fit Alice better than it fit me, slightly constricting, particularly around the shoulders, so I just sort of went with that. The makeup can't not have an affect on your performance. You can just embrace it and be 'at one with it,' then it works in your favor. The only time it starts to really disassociate with the character is at the end of a really long day — you just want to get everything off. My days were very long. I had no idea; they were 20, 21 hour days. One day I think I did 22 hours. It was not an easy experience, physically.""

**Painful days**

Terry remembers the long days and is full of admiration for Susana's ability to continue working when someone else might have collapsed from sheer exhaustion.

""It was incredibly taxing for Susanna, but she was a real trouper. She's into 6 hours of makeup before I even see her on the set and then there's also the costume. She's wearing metallic contacts which, once you get fatigues — and we're using smoke on the set — can really be an irritant. So she really had to work hard, and it's hard work to look effortless. When you're in a dire situation it can work for you, but when you're in complete control — a lot of her emotions are very subtle and contained, and there's a sort of an elegance about her even though she has this malevolence — it can prove taxing. By the time I'm at the end of a normal day she's almost into 20 hours; it was very grueling for her.""

**Good news**

But in one area at least, Susanna had an easier time than Alice Krige, as Michael Westmore explains: ""She was able to tolerate the contact lenses a little easier. It all has to do with a person's tolerance, because it's a hard sense. It was the exact same lens, although custom-made for her; they are sent down to e apace center in Texas to be silverized.""

**Different creatures**

The two Queens may look alike, but the script makes it absolutely clear that this Queen is different from the one we saw in *FIRST CONTACT*. However, Susanna felt there had to be a degree of continuity.

""We really got the first glimpse of the Borg Queen in *FIRST CONTACT*. So, I took some information from that. They did not want me to duplicate Alice's character, but my own development of the background for this character was that there had to be elements that were the same, because ultimately they come from the same brain; they are an extension of the same central brain. There might be more knowledge at any given moment, but there is still the same background.""

Susanna credits Brannon Braga, who (with Ryan Moore) helped create the Borg Queen for *FIRST CONTACT*, with helping to fine-tune her performance.

""Brannon was very helpful in that he wanted that kind of fluid quality of movement that Alice had. When I got on set, I pretty much got it, but he came down, watched me, and just said one thing — that there's no extraneous movement. I just realized that I might have been twitching a little bit and, because everything is perfect, any little twitch can stand out like a big one. That was real helpful. He also encouraged the quality of being … it's really not conversational … but there is not that drone quality about the Queen's speech.""

**Complex motives**

Susanna and Terry agree that the Borg Queen is much more than a simple villain. As Terry says,

""If you look at *FIRST CONTACT*, her relationship with Data it's like the seductress, and the seductive aspect is very intriguing because, you know there's this strange look with the Borg Queen where she is beautiful yet hideous at the same time. She's the bride of Frankenstein in some ways. She's manufactured from all these different things; she has all these things that to a human eye may be distasteful, but when you really look at her she's quite fascinating. Her face is very beautiful, and she has an elegance about her.""

Susanna agrees that despite the 'hideous makeup, there is something deeply attractive and seductive about the Borg Queen.

""Both Borg Queens are in a position of seduction, a different type of seduction, but nonetheless seduction. I think that my main role is to get it to a point where the seduction becomes believable. There is no doubt that she is attractive. I think power is incredibly seductive, and the conference of that power.""

**Mother figure**

The queen has to have this attractive quality because without it the audience would't believe that Seven could be persuaded to rejoin the Borg. Whereas the Queen used sex to seduce Data in *FIRST CONTACT,* Terry sees this Queen as more of an evil mother figure.

""It's as if Susanna comes back into her live much like a biological other would come back into some child's life, after years of not being there, and try and win her back, but in a very intelligent and manipulative way. Both these people are obviously incredibly intelligent and bold a lot of information. They're going to know what the other person is thinking, so they really have to work to push the buttons.""

Susanna sees this material relationship as the key to Seven's dilemma. ""There really are two maternal figures. Janeway and the Borg Queen, in whatever twisted maternal way she is, are these two sides that are pulling at Seven and they represent her identity. She used to be here, she went away, and now she's come back to the Borg, and there is a sense of deprogramming and re-brainwashing. That's what the Queen does to her, and that's where the seduction lies.

**The Queen's return?**

There's no doubt that 'Dark Frontier' is a major landmark for *VOYAGER* and is fit to stand alongside classics such as 'The Best of Both Worlds.' As Brannon Braga says, ""It turned out to be really, really amazing.""

So if the Borg Queen did return would Susanna get back into the makeup? She laughs, ""One of the crew members likened it to childbirth; you're going through so much pain that you say 'I will never do this again.' Then, when you forget the pain you think, well, maybe I will …""

\-------

The Borg Unicomplex was one of the most exciting things we saw in '*Dark Frontier*' The image is computer generated on screen, but Dan Curry began by making a wood model. Dan wanted to make sure that the Unicomplex had an unfamiliar shape that was consistent with Borg Design.

\-------

It took five and a half hours to transform Susanna Thompson, who also played Dax's former wife in 'Rejoined,' into the Borg Queen.

\-------

**The RAVEN takes flight**

For 'Dark Frontier,' VOYAGER's senior illustrator, Rick Sternbach, had to subtle redesign the Hansens' ship, which had already been seen in 'The Raven.'

*When the Raven made it's first appearance, it was just a wreck and did not have to stand up to sustained scrutiny.*

Rick Sternbach explains that although the *RAVEN* had already been seen on a previous episode of *VOYAGER,* it still needed a little design work: ""The shape of the Raven was not terribly well thought out, but it didn't have to be for the first episode because it was crashed - the hull was crumpled and the entire was torn loose. The sketch was sent to Foundation Imaging and they created the first image of the *RAVEN.* When we had to rework the configuration for 'Dark Frontier,' I got a printout of the ship from Foundation, so I would have a three-quarter perspective. I had initially wondered if I had rendered it a little too big. In the crashed version you really couldn't tell. In the revision we cut it down from eight or nine decks to four decks tops. This changed the scape of the windows and the entry hatches and that sort of thing.

*In 'Dark Frontier' the RAVEN had to be shown in perfect condition; Rick Sternbach took the opportunity to alter a few of the details, making the ship significantly smaller.*

\-------

**NINE YEARS OF THE BORG**

As one of STAR TREK's most experienced directors, Cliff Bole has 'worked with' the Borg Before.

Back in 1990 Cliff Bole directed STAR TREK's First two-parter, 'The Best of Both Worlds.' The story established the Borg as a major threat and is widely regarded as one of the best episode of *STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION.* Looking back, he doesn't feel that the Borg have changed much but adds that new technology has given him more choices as a director.

""The Borg haven't evolved a whole bunch. The Borgs are pretty set people; I think the only thing that's really changed is Jeri. I think the one big change is the fact that she's part human and part Borg.

""We just try to bring the new tools to each show, and the difference between the tools when I did 'The Best of Both Worlds' and 'Dark Frontier' is a heal of a lot, definitely. There are smaller cameras, steadicams, cranes, things like that and we try to bring that to use, and work as along as the studio gives us the money to do it, and this time they did.

""From a standpoint of being able to get the right moves from the camera, it's a question of equipment. I used the steadicam quite a bit and the town was so damned busy, it was tough to line up the guys I like and the cameramen I like. That became my main tool by the nature of the design of the set. It became more of a tool than a creative piece, because it just handled all the problems that came out of the design.""

\-------

**Lighting effects** 

Everyone who worked on the second part of 'Dark Frontier' is particularly proud of a special lighting effect that was designed for the Borg Queen

Both Cliff Bole and Terry Windell were delighted with the lighting in the Borg Queen's lair, which, as Cliff says, was var from standard. ""I know that \[on 'Dark Frontier'\] we went for an incredible lighting package. Theatrical lighting, almost a rock-and-roll package for a lot of the work.""

Terry took advantage of the lights to introduce a new, 'signature' effect for the Borg Queen: ""I requested that we have a very different look than we had seen before, and we had these computerized lights installed in the set that they could program to move. Since the Borg Queen deals with controlling the whole collective by her mind, we thought it would be interesting that, as she moved around, some of the lights actually followed her.""

Susanna Thompson loves the effect, which she thinks gave a greater sense of power and ambience o the character. She even has a theory about exactly what controls the lights: ""I have an electrical unit on the back of my head, and I guess you're left with the notion that that's what controls the light really.""

Technically, the effect worked very smoothly, though it did cause Terry some scheduling problems. ""What we would do is rehearse and when we had the blocking own with Susanna, then we would program the lights accordingly and she was fantastic about hitting her marks. She was very good. In terms of difficulty, what that did, the actual time to program the lights is something you don't really see when you're blocking out a week's worth of work.",startrek,DaWooster,False,/r/startrek/comments/h7koh5/behind_the_scenes_an_inside_look_at_dark_frontier/

This suggests the Klingon ship's teleporter engineer contacted the Enterprise computer, interfaced cleanly, delivered the Federation-compatible Klingon teleportation information packets into the Enterprise computer system which then converted the incoming transmitted matter from energy to mass so the Klingons could board the ship during an autodestruct emergency evacuation.

Why didn't Kruge order his own teleporter engineer to recall them?

With eight seconds to go, Kruge ordered his boarding party to ""Get out! Get out of there!

I’m just gonna discuss this as if it were one episode, because it was a two part story.

As usual, this far exceeded my expectations. I said in my last post that I didn’t think I would like it based on the description, at least the first part. Guys, I need higher standards. This was great!

Loved: the scene in episode ten with Miles and Julian coming out of the holosuite. God, everything they do together is pure gold. I’d watch the entire show just for that. It brings me so, so much joy.

The scene where a changling imitates Miles and tells Sisko that there are only 4 changlings on earth. That was just astoundingly creepy. Very well acted, and it definitely had impact for me.

Sisko ordering Nog to tell him the name of a Red Squad member. It was one of those rare moments where I felt like Sisko had purpose and control. 

Odo saving Sisko from the jail cell.

Sisko calling Kira to ask for help. I want to see their relationship as captain/first officer/friends evolve and I’m glad he trusted her.

Liked: Nog’s roll in these episodes. First off, I’m just thrilled he’s in the academy. Secondly, I want the world for him. 

The president of earth (the Federation?) was very believable to me. The obvious military decision may not be the best decision for civilians. I mean obviously we get some of that real life foreshadowing telling us to take early decisive action, but that really isn’t always the answer. 

The whole team from DS9 coming to save the day.

Disliked: you guys are going to be mad. I really couldn’t be bothered with Sikso and his dad and Jake. And I was so confused as to why they said, “Hey, we need to go stop a potential war with a more advanced society, LET’S BRING A KID TO VISIT HIS FATHER WHILE WE’RE THERE!” Miles and Julian both wanted to come but no. We got Jake. And I want Sisko to be capable of making his own decisions without conferring with Dax or his dad or telling Kira her religion is fake.

I also wanted to see more of the DS9 team trying to help or interfering or SOMETHING. But ESPECIALLY Odo. He felt so under used in an episode about his species.

Kasidy is a freighter captain who is regularly absent for such long periods that she is able to gift him a baseball cap from a planet eight weeks away. Then without discussing it with him she announces she's got a new job and she'll be around all the time.

I mean she's entitled to do that, but he's entitled to freak out. If I was in his shoes I'd feel the same even if my wife hadn't been killed by the goddamn *Borg*. If anyone overreacted and needed to apologise for being an asshole, it was her.

Now obviously this is an amazing episode and it really embodies what TNG was all about, but the scene of first contact between the Enterprise and the Tamarian ship has always thrown me off.

The Tamarian captain, Dathon, initiates contact with a string of allegory that is obviously completely incomprehensible to the bridge crew of the Enterprise, so Captain Picard, in all his wisdom, resorts to the standard greeting that he uses whenever he's faced with a new entity;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""*Captain, would you be prepared to consider the creation of a mutual non-aggression pact between our two peoples, possibly leading to a trade agreement and cultural interchange. Does this sound like a reasonable course of action to you?*""

&amp;#x200B;

...Hold on. ...What happened to 'I am captain Jean Luc Picard of the USS Enterprise'? or 'I represent the United federation of Planets'?

This line is followed by a shot of Troi rightfully gawking at Picard as if he had just proposed marriage to her mother, and for me at least, it really colored the rest of Picard's actions in the episode.

He comes off as a bit of bumbler, and while it doesn't really bring the episode down, it seems strange. First contact is right at the top of Picard's job description, its the main reason he treks the stars in the first place, and it's literally the explicit mission he's on in this episode. He knows how this is done and he's had time to prepare, there's no reason he should be flustered, and there's certainly no reason for him to bombard the Tamarians with wordy jargon when he knows the main problem they're facing *is a communications barrier*.

It really sets Picard up for an episode where he comes off somewhat less sharp than usual; refusing the knife, not being able to make his own fire, and taking longer than a lot of the audience to 'get' the structure of the Tamarian language.

Personally, there is no star trek installment that I hate. I think star trek v is probably the weakest installment and I acknowledge the issues that the motion picture have but that being said I love every or star trek film, like actually adore each of them, including the JJ films, nemesis and insurrection. I also love every single tv show. I think Voyager is the weakest of the shows but I still think its excellent and I absolutely love the direction of discovery and picard.

Lately though I have become very aware of the hate for discovery and Picard and honestly it worries me.

81,Watching all of DS9 before First Contact?,1591855511,"Hi! I'm a (relatively) new trekkie who has watched all of TOS, TNG, the TOS movies, &amp; Generations. I'm currently making my way through DS9, which is living up to all the praise I'd seen bestowed upon it. A brilliant show.

My question is basically this. I've been told that it's important to watch DS9 up to season 4, and VOY up to season 2ish before watching First Contact. But...I really don't want to stop watching DS9 and take a hiatus to watch VOY.

I've been watching TNG with my buddy and having a great time. I love the cast, I love the stories. We ventured out into TOS and I love that too, and we watched AOS and I'm not really one to complain about remakes, so I enjoyed that too. But we started watching DS9 and... it's like pulling teeth.

I don't know if it's because it's about dark subjects like colonialism and genocide (I'm not a fan of military/war movies in general, I work a fairly depressing job IRL so I try to watch lighter things when I get a chance) or the fact that the characters don't seem to like each other or vibe with each other as well as the Found Family of TNG, or that it's physically darker and more eye-strain-ey. Irregardless (edit: apparently and unfortunately not a fake word), I dread each next episode. We're cycling through episodes of different treks because they know I'm not the biggest fan, but I haven't exactly told them how hard it is or that it actually puts me in a notably bad mood that carries over to whatever we watch next. (My time with them is very important to me and I'm not willing to give up any part of it.) They've told me that if I don't like it, we don't have to watch, but I'm determined.

TLDR: I like star trek but need to talk myself into liking DS9 too. How do I have to look at DS9 to enjoy it as other fans do?

-Archer may be my least favorite captain. I get that he had no roadmap for how to act but he did some fucked up shit and was very xenophobic toward Vulcans

- Is there more of an underdeveloped character than Mayweather?

-Jeff Combs is such a good actor and plays many great characters in the ST universe

-The Xindi and temporal cold war story lines were garbage

-Way too much gratuitous sexy scenes. Early on with the decontamination stuff and in the last season there was back to back episodes with Orion slave girls and then the mirror universe with midriffs exposed all over

-T'Pol may be the worst Vulcan ever. So many emotions. I get she had a medical issue but still

-We finally get an explanation on the Klingon appearance issue between Enterprise, TOS, and TNG but still at a loss around what is going on in Discovery

-The finale was really fucking bad

-Trip is the best character and the heartbeat of the show

-The intro music was an abomination. I really liked the visual sequence but the song sucked. Both versions. It's just so incongruous with all the other ST shows. The lyrics reflect the show's ethos but the singing sounds like a cheap Jon Bon Jovi

For all my life I have been a huge Star Wars fan. Now as an 18 year old I have found Star Trek. As a science nerd I was quickly fascinated with the show with it’s more intellectual and scientific nature. 

Anyway I am now hooked with the original series from 1968 and plan to watch everything in order of release. I now have a question with what Netflix calls “episode 1” and episodes 12 and 13 (Melangerie part one and two) all from series one. This is the episode where captain Pike travels to Talos IV where those bumheadpeople live. This whole episode is then incorporated into into the later double episode Melangerie.  So was this episode always meant to be incorporated or was it first made and then later written into that later episode.

Now I don't want to get into a debate about writing or acting or how good or bad a character she was for the show, I know she gets a lot of hate from fans. I want to just discuss how competant her character actually is. I think it's personally in fitting with the show for her not to be particularly great at her job. She's still studying, with little experience when the Dax symbiote gives Sisko a reason to thrust her into a position she really shouldn't hold.

Take this episode with Nog. After Nog returns to the station with clear issues Sisko asks Ezri for a plan to rehabilitate him. Her response is to do nothing, ""patients are quite often able to choose their own paths to recovery"". Then after a few days Nog has moved into the holosweet, a new meeting is called by Sisko. Her solution? Do nothing, maybe Nog subconsciously knows what he is doing. Then a hologram basically takes over his care until he is completely rehabilitated.

27,"""From the Wormhole: Robert H. Justman - Main Title Madness"" from Star Trek The Magazine, May 1999",1591792445,"**""Main Title Madness""**

**In the First in a series of articles, veteran Star Trek Producer Robert Justman remembers the nightmare that was the opening title sequence.**

Dear reader; The editors and the other even more VERY IMPORTANT PEOPLE who publish this magazine have asked me to furnish, for your information and reading pleasure, some personal reminiscences of times gone by during the making of the original STAR TREK series — as well as some memorable moments that occurred during the first season of STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION.

Little do these nice, trusting people know what they have let themselves in for. (Come to think of it, neither do you.)  ""From the Worm-hole,"" a title which pleases me no end because it seems to promise no end to my articles, will therefore appear in this magazine from time to time and, in it, I will describe scenes of total terror, muttering madness craven cowardice, deep despair and hopeless hope. And those were just the good days. So, unplug the phone, lock the door, get a brewski or two, curls up in your favorite chair (preferably with your significant other) and get ready to enjoy reading about some of the incredible events and the brave and somewhat crazy but innocent people of yesteryear who labored to bring you a positive, optimistic view of the future.

For instance, did you know how the main title was created for the original series? No? Would you like to know? No? Okay, I'll tell you anyhow. This is how the craziness happened and Gene Roddenberry loved to tell the same story years later, after the emotional scar tissue had somewhat subsided.

**The madness begins**

In the spring of 1966, the studio contracted with the noted Howard Anderson Company to handle the optical effects needs of our newly sold series. The Andersons had built and photographed the *Starship Enterprise miniature* (at 14 feet long, some miniature!) and created the optical effects for both pilots. They were to supply us with a new enlarged library of shots of the *Enterprise in space –* shots that we could use generically for various episodes as well as the specific elements we needed for our new show's man title. Throughout the summer, we continually asked the head of the studio post-production department when we might be able to see some of the great footage that was being made for us. And all through the summer, he would put us off, saying, ""The guys are working hard but they don't want to show you anything until it's perfect. Just be patient and you'l get some great film.""

Finally, it was August and both Gene and I were very, very nervous; or to put it another way, we were terrified. Our first air date, September 8, 1966 was fast approaching and we hadn't seen diddley. Gene, normally a quiet sweet-tempered man, finally erupted, demanding that we see all the footage, perfect or not. Grudgingly, a viewing was setup.

**In the face of disaster**

We entered the projection room and settled back in our chairs. The lights went out. A few minutes later the lights came back on. I felt a bit unwell. We had seen a smattering of material, some useable — some not.

We remonstrated, ""Where are all the shots we need?"" The guy in charge of making the optically complex footage was a lovely man. He also was, as we soon discovered, totally exhausted. Back in the sixties, the kind of optical special effects we needed had only been made for full length motion pictures — never for television shows with demanding delivery schedules. For months, this highly skilled and talented man had been working the same kind of days we had — 14, 16, sometimes 18 hours, seven days a week. And, he was way behind schedule, a fact hitherto concealed to us by the studio. He and his overworked crew couldn't keep up with the demands of the show and he couldn't get that 14 foot spaceship model to fly just right. Shots of the *Enterprise* that looked just fine prior to compositing suddenly jiggled and joggled when combined with the various still and moving star backgrounds required to portray the ship's progress through space.

And then the real bomb dropped! Our friend delivered a pronouncement we really didn't want to hear. He yelled, ""You'll never make your first air date!"" whereupon he departed at warp ten for a rest cure. After sitting there, in shock, for some moments, several things became abundantly clear.

One: not making our first air date wasn't the only problem. Although we hoped that such a prediction was a bit of hyperbole generated by a guy on overload, it was now apparent we'd never make all our air dates unless we spread out the work. No matter how skilled its staff might be, we needed more than one optical effects house to handle the enormous workload we were generating. So I decided that, henceforth,  we'd parcel out the work on a show by show basis. (Eventually, in addition to the original group, we ended up using the services of three other optical effects companies that first season and, added several others during our second and third seasons. To help out, the Anderson Company generously furnished its various miniature shots, star background pates and transporter effects elements to the other firms, ordinarily its competitors.)

Two: we didn't have all the composited shots of the *Enterprise* that we were counting upon to construct our series main title. And without a main title for the series, we'd be kaput.

Gene just sat there, dumbfounded. Looking back at it now, I imagine that he believed that his burgeoning career as a creator-producer had just deburgeoned. My reaction was totally different. I was nauseated. If I had time to eat lunch, I couldn't have kept it down. Luckily in those days, I seldom had time for lunch.

**To the edit suite!**

Suddenly, Gene reburgeoned. ""Let's go,"" he said. ""Where?"" I asked. ""To the cutting room. We're going to make a main title!"" he replied as he grabbed my arm and took me in tow. And, during the next few hours sitting in a cutting room over a hot moviolas, we constructed most of what became the series main title from shots used in both *STAR TREK* pilots. I still shudder every time I see the old main title with that one shot of the *Enterprise* haltingly moving away from the camera. (Later when I put together our now-famous ""gag reel,"" I used that shot and dubbed in the sound of a Model T Ford sputtering and backfiring. It was a perfect blending of sight and sound.)

**Inspiration strikes**

My major contribution to the main title was devising how the cast credit would appear on screen. Gene was planning to just ""pop"" them in and out but I felt we needed something more kinetic. I suggested using an existing fast ""run-by"" of the ship which began in the far distance and exited close to the camera. As it passed, I described how it would deposit the title *STAR TREK* in its wake. Then, each time the ship zipped past again, the cast credits would be delivered in the same manner. Gene bought the idea, and we were home free with a main title that remained in use for the duration of the series.

I then went to work with post-production supervisor Edward K. Milkis, who had been hired by Gene to ride shotgun on our post-production requirements. (Eddie, who became my close friend, later produced many successful television series as well as major motion pictures.) To refine the new main title, we selectively clipped frames from the ship ""run-bys""so that as the *Enterprise* neared camera, it appeared to travel faster and faster, adding to the kineticism of the shot. But, while the visual needs of our series main title were being satisfied, another important deadline was fast approaching: we didn't have an opening narration yet — and we needed it now!

Would we make it in time? Would the good guys win? Tune in next month, folks, for the exciting conclusion to the strange but true tale of a year of living dangerously in the brambles and thickets of network series television as we boldly went, in full color, where no producer had gone before.

33,Are there any Dutch Star Trek fans here here?,1591776670,"Hello Reddit,

I am Jan, I have been a Star Trek fan for a long time, my first memory of Star Trek was when I saw my father watching the TNG episode 'unnatural selection', this was when Star Trek was still on Dutch television. Ever since I bought Netflix, I watch Star Trek almost every day. Unfortunately I have no friends who share this interest with me. I tried watching Star Trek episodes with them but they don't like it. That's why I always have to watch the episodes alone. I am thinking about becoming a member of the Dutch Star Trek club The flying dutch. Are there perhaps Dutch fans here who are also members of that club?

I am also looking for Dutch Star Trek fans to get in touch via the internet. I started the very first Star Trek podcast in Dutch. I would like to receive some feedback or new ideas.

In my Star Trek Podcast I mainly discuss star trek episodes. I go through them in an extensive summary with additional information about the context and references. I then give my opinion. I am currently discussing Season 1 of Star Trek Picard and Season 1 of Voyager.

In the closing minutes of Part 1, where Janeway discusses her idea of exchange with the Borg, I can’t help but parallel her discussion with Chakotay after the conference, with (alternate) Picard’s discussion with the senior staff from “Yesterday’s Enterprise”. In both cases, Janeway and Picard have made their respective decisions, and it’s time for the crew to go and do.

Similar writing, though, which appears to break the Roddenberrian rule of “there should be no conflict among the crew”, but I look at it from a different perspective: if nobody questions the Captain’s decision-making, then how does anybody know of the decision quality?",startrek,muze715,False,/r/startrek/comments/h06fei/spoiler_alert_scorpion_versus_yesterdays/
36,Trying to make sense of the Spore Drive,1591771558,"I have finally decided to watch Discovery, I like the tone, I like the way the episodes are structured... I like a lot about it, but at the third episode... I am just baffled at the spore drive, and why they thought this would be something the show should seemingly revolve around in some capacity.

its like taking a one-off stupid science thing of the week from early TNG, and saying ""this is what the show is about"" it should have just been a thing the other ship was experimenting with I think (I have only watched the first three episodes)

But... I am going to give it the benefit of the doubt, and try to make sense of it, using what we already know in the Star Trek franchise.

The principles in place here described, sounds a lot like Transwarp travel, the difference is that transwarp conduits are artificial and these conduits seem natural.

So here is how I think this works, and how it applies to the overall franchise. The spores arent so much a power source, as they are a navigational aid through this form of space.

This is probably the same sort of space as transwarp space, but the conduits are naturally forming, and they form along a similiar logic to the mycellium in mushrooms, by splicing the computer into these spores, they can predict how the spores would want to grow... and use that on a macro level to navigate naturally occurring transwarp conduits, without having to make your own which is beyond the scope of federation technology at this point in time.

however, since these galactic superstructures mimic organic growth, I am going to guess they are highly unstable, and this sort of travel is ungodly dangerous... especially towards organic life, because we see on the other ship lifeforms have been sort of ""tweeked"" and twisted, turned, and shifted.


A biological form moving through a conduit that has physics that mimic biology, is not a smart move.

So there it is, how I am going to explain this in my head moving forward, to try and get over this baffling psuedo-science. I havent watched much but can you guys tell me... how close am I to how they explain this stuff later?

46,New fan here. I'm almost finished with The Original Series and I loved it.,1591761818,"Up until about a month ago I had never watched any Star Trek media at all. One night I was bored looking through Netflix, saw Star Trek there and thought ""Well, that's such a big franchise, there's gotta be something to it. But also damn, it's such a *big* franchise... I guess I could watch at least one episode to see what the deal is. No strings attached."" Not knowing anything, I watched The Cage since it was listed as the first episode. I liked it, in fact, funnily enough I quite liked Captain Pike. Moving on to the ""second"" episode, I was like ""Wait, where is my captain?! Kirk, yeah, I know that name, but what's going on?"" The next day I looked it up. Kirk won me over after a few episodes and he's now my favorite character.

I looked some other things up as I tend to do regarding new things I start enjoying, but conservatively so as to not get spoiled (I don't care *too* much about spoilers, but I got this far without knowing almost* anything, so I decided to make the most out of that). *For example, I know that &gt;!Spock dies eventually.!&lt; That's pretty much it regarding anything major. I read that the episodes were quite hit or miss regarding quality and that there was no overarching storyline, so after the first few I started watching only those considered considered ""good"" based on my research and in some cases on whether the synopsis seemed interesting to me. I've considered going back and watching the episodes I skipped, but I also wanna move forward.

I've read that The Animated Series is a sequel to TOS, and its canonicity is disputed, yes? That's the most immediate thing I'd like advice on. I love the TOS cast but the canonicity issue, the shift in presentation (I don't dislike animation at all, just the shift is gonna be weird, and how good is the quality of the animation, by the way?) and wanting to move on to the movies is pushing me toward skipping TAS. The movies are good, yes? Especially 2, I've heard. I know Khan is in it, and I really liked him in the TOS episode.

Moving on, I didn't know there were this many shows and I'm not intending to go over everything in this thread, so I'll just ask about The Next Generation and be done for now. I was quite surprised that it takes place 100 years after TOS. So no Spock? Damn, I thought Spock would be a constant in the franchise. No problem, I'm still interested in it, I'm aware it's quite beloved (right?) and it being two decades newer than TOS makes me curious about the evolution of the franchise.

I'm interested in knowing if TNG is less episodic than TOS. I don't dislike episodic stories but I do prefer more overarching ones, especially as we're talking about a long-running TV show. I've read and I don't know if it's true, that season 1 is ""bad"" and season 2 is ""mostly bad."" I'm not gonna skip episodes based on their quality if the show has story arcs, but how ""bad"" is the start of TNG? Explain. (Sorry, I couldn't resist.)

The moral of this story was the women were beautiful all along but in order to channel their beauty they needed to rely on confidence.  Now this made some sense for during the women's ""ugly scene"" they were still beautiful just their hair and make-up seemed messed up.  Now I think that was a case of bad graphics telling a better than good graphics would.  Modern effects would have the women look quite scary and that would have undermined that main point that all you need is confidence.

However if the Venus drugs just gave the women confidence how were they able to drive all the men on the Enterprise mad with lust?  These men serve with women who are in the prime of their life, full of confidence, and rocking mini-skirts!  How were Mudd's women able to capture their attention without some kind of bio-chemical additive to the mix?

After watching TNG Voyager TOS ENT and DS9 
In that order including the movies 
I finally joined a community about it
But I’ve sadly noticed all the hate for Voyager one of my favorites 
It seems (most) fans love DS9
Which To me felt was a little bleak and “DC”ish 
And the acting was pretty stiff for the first season

I understand voyager had a few continuity errors

73,Political/moral issues in modern treks?,1591735509,"Forgive me if this is a topic that has been addressed already, or if I’m misremembering certain things about the newer ST shows (DIS and PIC).  

It seems like the older shows focused much more on issues of morality and politics than the newer shows.  “Far Beyond the Stars” and “The Measure of a Man” feel like appropriate examples from two different shows that demonstrate how they tackle those kinds of issues.

I can’t think of many issues beyond “the bad guys are doing bad things and must be stopped” that are really addressed in newer trek shows.  PIC sort of touches on android rights, but not nearly as deeply as “The Measure of a Man” did.  DIS kind of approaches some issues like global warming and maybe a few other social issues by showing them represented in the Mirror Universe.  However, just as PIC does, DIS barely scratches the surface of each issue.

tl;dr - It feels like those important questions Star Trek would make us ask ourselves are not present in newer shows, and I miss it deeply.",startrek,skywardstarer,False,/r/startrek/comments/gzvrk0/politicalmoral_issues_in_modern_treks/
74,"After Picard, it feels so good to watch Enterprise again.",1591734642,"Watching this series in 2020 is so good. The Lore is respected (for the most part), and that's for me the greatest satisfaction after Discovery and Picard. To feel that the saga is honored, that we don't change the Klingons' behaviour for no apparent reason and to not have a 10h plot without originality. Good old episodic, evolving characters (and it's crazy how strong the antipathy towards Vulcans through T-Pol is in the first season) and risk taking (season 3).

&amp;#x200B;

And also a trekking budget. By that I mean they gave too much money to Discovery, and they abused it with too much CGI and... I don't know... like mass effect. This is pure Trek like we've been missing for at least 5 years. Since 2009 for me.

&amp;#x200B;

And another important point: they weren't afraid of ridicule. I noticed that in the new post-Kelvin series: Star Trek took itself too seriously visually, which limits its creativity. Now in Enterprise, they're going all out: costumes, alien ships, so much for ridicule as long as it gives access to good science fiction and the dialogue that goes with it.

&amp;#x200B;

I highly recommend reviewing Enterprise on its merits. And this series has a lot of them. It's even astonishing to what extent we accepted dialogues of a rare mediocrity (Discovery especially) to look young and trendy. Here at least, we find the basis of Star Trek.

&amp;#x200B;

After DS9 and Voyager, we only had one thing in mind: to see what's coming up. Enterprise went the other way, and it was a disappointment at the time also because it was too little about the birth of the Federation.

Were these only filmed/written because there were available sets that had even built for other productions, so it made for cheaper filming?

82,Smart set design and writing so we overlook inconvenient problems,1591726796,"My favorite example is the Spock-o-scope. In the 1960s, most computers didn't have screens like they do today, so it would have been a challenge to design what a computer screen of the future should look like. And even if they did, it would have been tough to pull off using the kind of special effects available to a 1960s TV show. The Spock-o-scope is perfect because it clearly shows the audience that Spock is reading data, and using the computer, but required no special effects beyond a blue light bulb.

Inertial dampers are a great way to solve the problem of having many Gs of force when the ship accelerates to warp speed. I don't think it's ever explained how they work - they just do, allowing the crew to go to warp without dying.

In ""Trials and Tribble-ations"", Worf gives the perfect explanation for why Klingons changed in appearance after TOS. ""We do not discuss it with outworlders"". It's a nod to the audience that yes, there is a pretty big discrepancy, yet the plot can keep going without any problems.

I'll put artificial gravity in the ""maybe"" pile. It's necessary because the show is filmed on Earth with a constant 1G gravity. It's just funny that no matter how horribly damaged a ship is, or how little power it has, the artificial gravity continues to work. (The only exceptions I recall are Star Trek 6, and one scene in an episode of Enterprise. I almost wish these counter-examples didn't exist, because they we could just assume that gravity plating is a passive technology that doesn't require any power.) The lamest use I can recall is an episode of DS9 where Sisko made an old-style Bajoran ship. He made a big deal of building it exactly as it would have been back then, except that he added gravity plating.

Now, it's not like the quality of the 4k upscale another poster here has been doing, but the different is nothing less than striking.

I felt the distrust started early and then the rest of the episode was, “I don’t trust you.” “Well, I don’t trust you either.” Worf was hurt and that could have played a bigger roll in the outcome, or added more of a sense of danger. This would have been a good episode to have a side plot of something silly going on on the station, like Julian and Miles in Explorers. Scenes like those make this show really vibrant to me- they’re lighthearted, fun, exciting, but also simple and easy to watch. This would have been a perfect place to insert one of those. There have been less of those so far in this season and even though the quality of writing, characters and production seems to have increased, I miss that. I do really love when Dax interacts with the Klingons. She makes it feel like Curzon wasn’t quite done romping around with them so she’ll have to carry on for him. It’s jovial but she also seems very skilled, which I love to watch. 

Our Man Bashir: I knew this one would be fun just from the title. I am simply amazed at how angry Julian and Garak can get at each other and not care about it five minutes later. We got to see Julian being a lady’s man without being super demeaning, which I found really funny. I was going to say that everything Garak does is pure gold but honestly I was surprised when he told Julian over and over again to quit and let them die. I know Garak isn’t going to be the heroic, leave no-man behind type of person, because that’s now how he was trained, but he was really quick to just throw everyone out the window. Whoops, they’re all gone. It’s not that I didn’t like this part, but it wasn’t what I expected. LOVED when Julian shot him for it. Didn’t love when Julian used Garak’s speech at the end. I was totally caught up in how smooth Julian was throughout and wanted to see his line- how he intended to get out of a bad situation whether Garak was there or not. 

I could have gotten through one more episode but the next one is a two parter so I’ll save that whole thing for one post.

* Nobody wears a watch. Sure, today, we have cell phones with clocks, but that doesn't seem the case in Trek. Heck, they don't even seem to have pockets.
* 3D Chess has replaced 2D chess. Of course, game popularity changes over time, but chess is over 1500 years old. It's not going to just disappear.
* Almost every door is automatic. This might make sense on a starship, but in practically every planet visit, if there's a door, it's automatic.

10,Enterprise: An Appreciation,1591702156,"When I first got into this franchise I was told, like most others that TOS was campy, TNG was fantastic and DS9 was complex. All of which I found to be more or less true. However, at the end of the list there was one little show that everyone said was awful. Called Enterprise. The characters were terrible, the theme is dreadful, and the show had nothing to offer. 
 When I reached this show I watched with some level of dread. How could something named Trek be so bad? The answer: it wasn’t.
 
 Over time, I’ve noticed (especially recently) that more and more people have come around to it, and I feel that this is a good time to talk discuss the show in a new light. So I wish to evaluate some of the criticisms levelled at the show and discuss our opinions.

For one let’s discuss the concept. From what I understand, most people didn’t want a prequel. I understand of course, but in retrospect I believe this was a wonderful idea. 
 After three separate shows set in the same time, the idea to go back and explore how it all came about is a very clever one. To see how the things we had come to know, be created and explored would open up some remarkable storylines, and setting the show in a time before The Federation gave the characters and humanity as a whole a sense of vulnerability that had never been seen in the franchise before. For once, humanity was the underdog. 
 Roddenberry gave us the inspirational universe where humanity had gotten over their greatest faults and become a better version of themselves, but this show examined how it came to be. To me that is worthy of exploration.

To make the man who helped create The Federation, something which we all knew very well, the idea to make him perfect would be all to easy to come to. However, instead they portray a flawed and self-doubting man who must get past his prejudice of Vulcans and learn to evolve his character and become the man who would change the universe. In many ways, he was a take on Cochrane, a character that would be undoubtedly be turned into a perfect heroic figure of legend, was just an ordinary man who fought hard to better himself. Many people wrote him off from the start, claiming he was ignorant and even racist, but if they had stuck around they would have seen his darker descent and his becoming a better man because of it. Many people equate character flaws and writing flaws together, but this was not the case. 

The Vulcans for the show were likewise labelled too arrogant and again racist. In retrospect though, this was entirely the point. To show Vulcans and Humanity’s journey to become firm allies from a cold relationship is not only a pretty realistic interpretation of how humans would react to such a species, but it only adds further depth to Kirk and Spock’s relationship. This series shows that in many ways, Humans and Vulcans need each other. Vulcans teach humans that jumping in blind is a bad idea, and not to expect other species to always follow their ethics and morals. While Humans teach Vulcans that there is more to life then Logic and suppressing themselves will only lead to their downfall. 

Overall the show is flawed especially in the first two seasons, but given time the show found a way to balance the scales and bring to life the universe we all knew from a different perspective. There were bad episodes of course, but there so there were in TOS, TNG and even DS9. 

 It was a flawed experiment but one I believe still adds value to the universe and I hope that more and more people come around to it.

If anything, I hope that some will go back to the series with an open mind and give it a try from a fresh perspective.",startrek,IrritatedandHungry,False,/r/startrek/comments/gzlbds/enterprise_an_appreciation/

27,So why do you like deep space 9?,1591673872,"I'm somewhere in season 5 I believe at this point. I've seen a lot of people say ds9 was their favorite. I've got to be honest - I think it's terrible.

There's a good moment here or there but in general I can't stand it. 

First off, why is it always so dark? Like, turn some lights on you guys. You've been there for half a decade, so I'm not going to accept some weird excuses about who built the place or who was running it before the federation moved in. Miles could have had this place fitted with some nice bright lights by now. Does everyone there just prefer feeling dirty and dark all the time? Is dingy the cool new look at this time?

Second, after five seasons I just don't care about a lot of the characters. Especially for the first couple seasons, some characters were criminally underutilized or underdeveloped. Even to this point, jadzia has barely had screentime. They treat her when she's around as if she's an important part of the crew but she's rarely there. I dislike sisko the majority of the time, but that's ok because it feels like there are 2-4 episode stretched where he doesn't even make an appearance (similar to jadzia). If I were to tell you who the main characters were really, I'd say quark, Kira, and odo. Maybe obrien, or maybe he's relegated to second tier characters like sisko, Bashir and warf. 

Third, the pacing is awful. Not in any one single episode, but from episode to episode. I went into this expecting a war with the dominion. We've had very few interactions with the dominion or gamma quadrant powers at all five years in. Early on it felt like we were getting lots of trips through the wormhole or from wormhole into alpha, but those seemed to have stopped and most episodes are stand alone type episodes.

We had an entire invasion fleet go through the hole and the very next episode there was like no mention of it. I forget specifically what the episode was but I had to double check to make sure I didn't skip an episode (or season). The dominion didn't even seem to react to the whole thing. I thought ok maybe an episode or two, but the whole season goes by and it's like it didn't even happen outside of a couple mentions regarding politics with the Klingons.

About 5/7 of the way through this and it feels like next to nothing has happened. TNG had philosophical musings that ds9 rarely goes into (or they don't feel as important). Voyager had the destination home in the back drop. Ds9 has the dominion war which to date is a massive disappointment. Even if the last two seasons are excellent, I just don't think it makes up for the majority of the show being a whole lot of nothing.

My biggest complaint with Picard was that it took half a season to get going. Ds9 STILL hasn't really got going anywhere.

33,"Long Time Star Trek Fan Finally Watches DS9: season 4, episodes 6 + 7",1591668293,"I finally had a chance to sit down to some DS9! Today we watched Starship Down and Little Green Men

Starship Down had some really exciting character development for me. There was the obvious part where my heart skipped a beat watching Dax and Julian together (and you gotta love when Dax told him she used to think he was trying to be a hero when he did stuff like that, but now she understands he’s just stupid). But then there were the more interesting ones. 

I was surprised that I actually liked Quark in this. I liked the metaphor for weighing risks and benefits a lot. I thought that translated really well. I also agree to an extent that everyone has some greedy, selfish part of them, even if it’s small or we don’t act on it. I liked the way this episode talked about greed better than the ones in the past. 

Sisko felt like a different person to me. I’m not sure it was for the better- I like him better as an admin than a starship captain in battle. But when he was hurt, things really took and interesting turn. Did I love watching Kira pray over him? No. But I did love her speech telling him that he has to come to terms with the ways in which he is a religious figure, and that he should make an effort to get to know her outside of work despite his place in her faith. I loved the scene at the end where he invites her to a ball game. I feel like she lit up and that’s what I want to see from her. On the flip side of that, I feel like she totally, totally cracked under pressure. She’s first officer. Why isn’t Worf on the ground with the captain while she’s taking charge? I get that she is personally closer to the captain and Worf caring for someone who is injured is kind of a ridiculous thought, but Kira went straight to, “I am totally emotional, please take care of the whole ship is falling apart thing.” And I am very interested in watching the captain interact with Worf more. 

Loved Miles and Worf. I feel like Worf’s character is really well portrayed in the awkward transition from security to command. He doesn’t quite understand how the enlisted dude’s run things and I think Miles showed him pretty respectfully. Worf grew in a big way in that scene.

I have a question here: is there no way for Miles to work his way up the ranks? I mean I know he doesn’t want to but they make it sound like if you didn’t attend the academy you will always be the lowest rank and I didn’t realize it worked that way?

Little Green Men: you guys are going to be mad- I wasn’t into it. I did really like the side story of the military girl and the professor being in love. But I was kinda annoyed Quark was smuggling something that could jeopardize Nog’s trip to the academy. I feel like the whole subplot of Rom being an engineering genius came out of nowhere (it didn’t first appear in this episode- I think it was first mentioned when Nog was taking his prep school entrance exams- but then we suddenly went from Rom the idiot to Rom the idiot except he’s a brilliant engineer and now it’s involved in most of the Ferengi plots). Obviously Quark drove me nuts here. And it just wasn’t Odo’s best episode. He didn’t shine but he honestly wasn’t special. And I really, really like Odo. I understand that he can’t be the center of attention in every episode he’s in but I feel like even his main character traits got buried here. Oh hey, the shapeshifter will save us. I just didn’t get the sense of urgency from this one. Quark was being an idiot and to be fair, they were briefly mistreated in interrogation but It just didn’t work for me.

I don't even really have a problem with that, I mean everybody's entitled to their opinion. It's just that any time Voyager comes up, even in the most neutral sense, the thread is piled on with a bunch of played out complaints about it.

For an example, see [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/gyy3el/voyager_episodes_where_they_almost_get_home/) thread. You can't get much more vanilla than ""hey guys, what were the episodes when this happened?"" yet we get 50+ comments about lizard babies and whatever.

As difficult as it may be to believe, some of us actually like Voyager and it would be fun to talk about it without having to hear about how it wasted its potential, or its characters weren't developed, or the reset button, or how Harry never got promoted, or whatever else has been said a million goddamn times.

We get it, it's all been said over and over and over. Can the five or six of us Voyager fans please discuss our terrible taste in sci-fi in peace?

What if that is because they were hyper-evolving. Unbeknownst to the crew of Voyager, maybe Paris and Janeway's babies kept hyper evolving. Unlike other glowy folk they kept hyper evolving until the end of reality, at which point they transcended even further. 

The Q seem to exist outside of time so that doesn't matter. The reason they are so fascinated by humanity is because humanity's evolution resembles what they have been able to work out about their own when no-one else does.

58,What would be the least respected professions in various Star Trek races?,1591632716,"I was watching 'Suspicions' (TNG S06E22), which features a Ferengi who references being discriminated against because he's a scientist (instead of, presumably, a businessman), and I had some fun wondering what the least respected professions would be for Star Trek races. I mean they all *need* scientists, doctors, lawyers, dentists... etc... but those jobs would be treated very differently in different cultures. Here's some of what I thought, would be interested to see what others think.

I think the ideal or most respected profession is usually pretty obvious, but the least respected is quite tricky.

**Ferengi** \- Most respected: Businessman. Least respected: I think scientists could be totally respected in Ferengi society provided they turned research into latinum. Any job where you cold focus on profit would be fine, so I'd have to say philanthropist.

**Klingon** \- Most: Warrior, obviously. Least: I think Klingons would respect a lot of professions that are very non-warrior-y. I could imagine chefs being respected, and singers/actors (Klingon opera). So... I think maybe merchant or salesman?

**Vulcan** \- Most: Scientist (or diplomat? philosopher?) Least: I'm really not sure. Stand up comic? 😂 It would have to be something that stood against logic.

**Romulan** \- Most: Military officer (I mean it could be secret service/Tal Shiar agent, but they're more feared than respected?) Least: Not sure. It's not a profession as such but political activist maybe? Something that is against the state.

**Cardassian** \- See Romulan

**Bajoran** \- Most: Priest/holy person Least: I mean there's an obvious answer here in that we see Bajorans who collaborated with Cardassians being clearly the most reviled. But 'Cardassian collaborator' isn't really a profession. I can imagine scientists being less respected in Bajoran society if they stood against religious teachings?

**Borg** \- Most: Borg. Least: Not a Borg

67,DS9 Season Seven,1591601733,"I finished it yesterday and I must say the plot felt a bit weird.  


1- The war has always felt strange for me in a sense: the Dominion forces are stranded in the Alpha Quadrant and have only the resources of the Cardassians to build ships and breed Jem'Hadar from, yet they consistently outnumber the combined Federation-Klingon-Romulan alliance. Please note that during the war they lose several (at the very least two) shipyards, as well as breeding facilities.  


2- Section 31 infects the Founders and when the Federation finds out it doesn't think of using the cure as a diplomatic tool. Your enemies are dying and hopeless, if you offer the cure they would have no choice but to accept. You can literally force them to dismantle the Dominion altogather. Instead, they stay silent so the Founders fight the war with increasing ferocity just out of spite. Also, had they actually died, the Jem'Hadar and Vorta would have just kept fighting, maybe driven to utter madness by their god's death. The Vorta also can operate the Dominion without the Founders.  


3- Gul Dukat's pah-wraith arc is... odd. Never liked it. That whole subplot builds up strangely and ends in a very underwhelming way.  


4- The Breen felt overpowered. A weapon that can just shut down every ship of the Alpha Quadrant?  


5- Ezri Dax felt like a rather poor replacement for Jadzia. I'd rather have ""Dax"" just die. His/her return as Ezri made for poor ""soap opera"" interactions with the crew.  


6- Not knowing anything about the final treaty was unsatisfying. The serie puts a lot of emphasis on politics, after all, and it would have been nice to know what the Dominion War actually led to...

Of course I continued to rent each season and watch it as fast as I could falling in love with some races such as the Ferengi and hating others.

76,My first time watching Star Trek,1591587700,"I didnt’t grow up with Star Trek when I was younger. I watched Star Wars mainly (i know, i know).

But recently I decided to give it a shot. I watched clips of it on youtube, and while I found it to be very cheesy at times, I still was intrigued.

I’ve started with The Next Generations, and i have to say, the first season was pretty bad in my honest opinion. I guess it just was too “cheesy” and didn’t explore any of the ideas I thought it would. It was so bad I didn’t bother to finish it.

But i skipped to the second season.

I could see the improvements in the writing. I understood there were no overarching narratives really, so skipping episodes wasn’t a huge issue (personally any episode that involves a huge romance plot, last one i can remember watching was Troi and that negotiator for the wormhole).

And in season 2 i saw “The Measure of a Man”. Wow. I knew what happened in the end, I’d seen it on youtube. I still cried my eyes out when Data looked fondly on Tasha. I still cried when the episode was over.

I just finished the episode “The Offspring”. Beautiful. Again, I knew what happened. I’m still crying while writing this. Whenever Guinan and Lal interacted, or when Data and his daughter interacted I had the biggest smile. When she said “Thank you for my life” i lost it.

This is such a beautiful show. I only hope the future is as bright as what they portray.

If Star Trek has taught me anything, it is that there is nothing more noble than to be first ignorant, but then to find some sort of answer or understanding.

[http://www.letswatchstartrek.com/tng-episode-guide/](http://www.letswatchstartrek.com/tng-episode-guide/)

But   even in the ""avoid"" episodes, I still find them entertaining. Anyhow, I  avoided watching Star Trek as a kid because I thought it looked boring   compared to Star Wars especially with the turn based battles and techno   babble. How wrong was I with this. Techno babble isn't too bad and not  overdone and the ship battles are still thrilling.

My  only issue is Wesley. I guess he's okay, but it's  kind of dumb how  that kid always seem to be right. I was surprised when he didn't pass  the Starfleet exam, but then again they made it so because he was ""too  nice"" from  encouraging one of his classmate to win. This scene was  still in my  favorite in Datalore.

Speaking  of Data, he's probably one of my favorite characters in the  show with  the humor. While something about Geordi makes him feel more relatable,  maybe because he seems more relaxed as opposed to acting like a  Starfleet officer 24/7. It was also interesting to see Picard and his   different sides. He came off as a dick as first with how stern and  stringent he was, but you find out he really cares a lot about the crew  and tries hard to pursue pacifistic solutions. The episode where he uses  the holodeck to live out his detective fantasy was cool with showing  his more fun side.

Which is why  the Plinkett reviews of the various TNG movies made sense with how  different he seem to be in them.  That reminds me, the gore at the end  of the Conspiracy episode in Parasite was unexpected with the exposed  head and exposed body cavity revealing the parasite queen.

I  guess I'm being lenient, but some of the fight scenes were surprisingly  not too bad at least the ones I saw in the beginning with Tasha. The  one in Conspiracy with Riker and Quinn throwing high crescent kicks were  hilarious though.

They must have used some secretive demolition tech, along with sonic dampening fields and holo projection, to mask their slicing open the mountain to install the base.

Anyway that's not enough. Nope now they're sending Starfleet officers including the galactic hero Data to stroll around in sneaksuits. Data of course goes ballistic due to him discovering the holo ship (more on that later) and the Fleet blame his emotion chip.

Ok moving on. We have the glorious *Enterprise* meeting an alien species with Picard grimly stating they need ever ally they can get, thanks to the Dominion War. So let me see. If the Dominion hadn't attacked and resources weren't running a little low/alliances weakening, Picard and the Fleet wouldn't have been bothered meeting with these aliens? They were just a means to an end? Selfish and entirely in tune with how antagonistic characters have referred to the Federation before.

On we go. We have the clearly suspicious Admiral Dougherty giving Picard the bad news about Data. Picard knows shits not as straightforward as Dougherty claims. So what, he's learned not to trust the Admiralty? That's a bad sign right?

And wait. Picard, the most xenofriendly captain we've met, doesn't even bat an eyelid about the cloaked spy base? That's standard operating procedure now? Ok...

He says fuck this and orders the ship to go get their android buddy back. Data tells him what's what. They find the holoship. Except it's technically a cloaked ship. Cos the *Enterprise* didn't pick it up. A cloaked Federation ship. The only one approved under the treaty with Romulus was the *Defiant*. Wtf? Picard is disturbed by its presence but not its *existence*.

Flip the channel to Dougherty. We know very little about this bearded troll, only that he's trying and failing to look like the silver fox version of Riker (who ironically shaved). What's his motivation here? He details the challenges the Federation is facing, under the massive strain of the ongoing Dominion War. But are there Jem'Hadar raids against planetary food supplies? If so, what about replicators? Feed them matter and they shit out food and piss out prune juice.

Speaking of...what have supplies got to do with life extensions? Are Starfleet secretly hoping to bribe the Dominion into a truce with this? Cos otherwise, where is the use of life extension except for selfish reasons? In fact, in two quadrants with apparently reduced supplies, surely life extension *increases* the demand.

In the end the film was a valiant attempt by Michael Piller to bring a Heart of Darkness tale to the TNG movieverse. It failed despite charismatic acting, beautiful music and just an optimistic tone...and I think the main issue that stands out for me is Dougherty wasn't the main bad guy.

18,[Fan Art] I made my own TNG themed game character. Presenting Ensign Chloe Winters!,1591538024,"Qapla', everyone!

I'm an aspiring 3D character artist and I've been working on developing my skills, so I've been working on some characters! Today I finally finished one of them, my own TNG themed OC character, Ensign Chloe Winters. I don't have a backstory written or anything, this project was done purely for the visuals. In compliance with the subreddit rules, here is a link! https://www.artstation.com/artwork/48oNRn

I also have an imgur gallery of all the WIP stages if you're curious about the development steps. Imgur has flagged the album as ""Mature content"" but don't worry, it's totally safe for work. Beneath the uniform, she's anatomically a barbie doll. https://imgur.com/a/HDWurtL

I've tried to keep her as compliant as possible with the TNG aesthetic, although I had to make her PADD bigger than the ones from the show to work with the animation. I'm not an animator, so the animation I used was from Mixamo and I'm not experienced enough to make big enough adjustments to suit a smaller PADD. 

The entire uniform was reverse engineered from screenshots of the original show and I'm not 100% certain that I have the seams right. Trying to simulate it was an absolute nightmare, it took a long time into development before I realised that the yoke section (the black part around the neck/shoulders) was a seperate piece that was padded and stitched over the rest of the uniform.

47,Finally Finished Discovery Season 2. My Thoughts.,1591475696,"TL;DR: 

* First half better than the second.
* More interesting than Season 1.
* Characters were the highlight, overarching story less so.
* U.S.S. Enterprise was gorgeous.
* Excited to see where the series goes from here.

Discovery. This series has been a wild, wild ride. And the quality of the show has varied wildly, but through it all I remained invested. Season 2 had what I feel to be the best episodes so far. Especially in the first half where it leaned into a more trekky feel. The whole plot with Control and the sphere data was... not as interesting. It just seems to come out of nowhere and, by necessity, takes hold of the whole plot.

But the real stars of the show for me were the characters. Saru just has an enjoyable presence on screen and I'm honestly happy he's got command of the ship from here on out. I feel like he deserves it. Stamits and Culber's relationship was also interesting to watch unfold, though did feel a bit forced at the end. Pike's captaincy was an enjoyable change of pace from Lorca, probably due to his more trustworthy nature. And Georgiou got a number of laughs out of me and was genuinely interesting to watch on screen. In some ways she reminds me of Garak of DS9 fame, uncertain who's side she's actually on and unsure whether she likes you or wants to stab you in the back. 

Burnham's relationship with Spock was... okay? It didn't knock my socks off but it wasn't outright terrible. Though, admittedly, I do feel that Spock having a *second* surprise sibling is a bit much. Though I find a good bit of amusement out of it.

And now, the Enterprise. It looks great. More modern looking than one would expect but I'm not complaining too much. The final battle in which we saw it felt way too crowded. Like the ships were swarmed with angry bees. And I would have preferred a bit more movement on the part of the lager ships rather than them just standing there and getting blasted.

All in all, I enjoyed myself. This was a fun season and with Discovery's departure into the future, who knows what will happen now. It's exciting. Here's hoping Picard will suffice in the meantime (side note, wow, does Picard feel so different. Though having different series explore different themes and styles it probably the best move.

It's difficult to list all of the things I enjoyed about the episode, because there are so many. I doubt that there are even ten episodes of TNG that I enjoyed so much. One of the most satisfying aspects for me is that it corrects an injustice in ""Sins of the Father"" that I always found intolerable. As Picard points out to Worf, ""Your discommendation is a facade to protect less honorable men. It is a lie. Lies must be challenged."" Yes! Finally. The truth wins. I also love the way that, in the end, Worf illustrates Picard's observation, ""You took the best qualities of humanity and made them part of you."" We see how Worf brings together the highest values of two worlds in the way in which he lives his life. (We also see further confirmation that he takes to heart the lessons of Klingon mythology and traditions, whereas so many Klingons become corrupted by the desire for power.) Other characters had great moments as well. Picard sees exactly what Lursa and B'Etor are planning (""If I find Toral's challenge valid, the two of you will very quickly gain control of the Council and Gowron will be found dead shortly thereafter. If I reject Toral's claim, you will accuse me of serving Federation interests. It will serve as a rallying cry to declare war and overthrow Gowron."") and offers the Federation a solution to the difficult dilemma of noninterference vs. the need to thwart a Romulan plot. Data has the opportunity to prove that he can be a great captain of a starship by exposing the Romulans just when they find a way to disrupt part of the Federation's tachyon net and it begins to look like they might be successful after all. 

I have to admit I was never pleased to learn what happened to alternate-timeline Tasha Yar after the events of ""Yesterday's Enterprise."" Part of the appeal of Yar's character for me is that she rose above the pain and degradation of her dark past and made something of herself. The revelation of what happened after her heroic choice to go back with the Enterprise C seems to reverse all of that. Her life ended in the way it began with more pain and degradation. How sad. I'm also still not sure of what I think of Sela. Despite this, ""Redemption"" is one of my favorite Star Trek episodes.

&gt; California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday revealed guidelines for film and television productions to resume in Hollywood after months of shutdown due to the novel coronavirus pandemic.


&gt; ""**Music, TV and film production may resume in California, recommended no sooner than June 12, 2020, and subject to approval by county public health officers** within the jurisdictions of operations following their review of local epidemiological data including cases per 100,000 population, rate of test positivity, and local preparedness to support a health care surge, vulnerable populations, contact tracing and testing,"" the California Department of Public Health said in a statement via the Governor's Office on Friday. 


[Jeri Ryan](https://trekmovie.com/2020/05/26/watch-jeri-ryan-talks-star-trek-picard-season-2-during-voyager-reunion-panel/) said during ‘Voyager’ reunion panel that production was originally scheduled to start on June 12, provided that the sets were ready.

1,"Why is my attitude towards ""filler"" episodes different from DS9 to most story-driven anime?",1591385828,"To elaborate: DS9 is a mostly depressing and dark series with a semi-episodic format, and when it breaks from the main story and follows the adventures of Quark or they go to Vic's Bar or any other holosuite adventure, I feel a sense of relief as it acts a break from the more traumatic and heavy Dominion War episodes. I even find myself looking forward to these more lighthearted adventures.

Now, let's talk about anime. A lot of those series with an overarching story format throw in episodes that break from the main story, usually of a comedic nature. However, these are less of a tension relief method and instead are used to pad out time to let the source material it's based off of catch up. 

Either way, these fillers are mainly seen as time-wasters and are looked down upon in the anime community, even so far as to creating an entire website dedicated to listing *every* filler episode of pretty much any anime where it matters, so that one can skip them altogether and keep on track with the main plot.

I use this list as well when watching shows like Naruto and the like that are filled with filler, but I'm willing to bet DS9 has an even bigger filler ratio, and yet, I gladly sit through all of them.

5,Long Time Star Trek Fan Finally Watches DS9: Season 4 episodes 1-5,1591381910,"The Way of the Warrior: I feel so bad for Worf, but at least we get to keep him! I supposed we’re gonna have issues with the Klingons now that they aren’t part of the Federation. That said, I feel like he fits seamlessly into this series. I definitely see that jump in quality everybody talks about, even though I did like this show before.

The Visitor: okay you guys finally got me into Sisko and his dad. There were tears. Maybe a lot of tears. In the end this was sort of a zero consequence episode but somehow also completely emotionally brutal. Sisko is always going to know that his son would decide, over and over and over, to give up everything for him. Not very many people get to know someone like that.

Hippocratic Oath: I think this is one of the best episodes I’ve seen so far. Now, granted, I DO prefer when Julian and Miles are friends. Significantly. But this showed some truly incredible parts of their personalities. Miles, who spent most of his career on the Enterprise, could never let Julian accomplish what he wanted to do. Julian, who is incapable of not caring, could not leave without trying to help. It was the most honest episode of any show I have ever seen in my life. The scene at the beginning was also a gem.  That said, and you guys probably know by now that I’m going to say this: there were NO CONSEQUENCES AGAIN. I mean, of course Julian wasn’t going to bring Miles up on charges but like... we’ve essentially established that between them, the chain of command means absolutely nothing and Miles is gonna do what Miles is gonna do. Julian's desire to help at any cost just cuts me to my core. I want to be like that... without the naive, constantly babbling part.

Indiscretion: This is interesting. Gal Dukat seems to be a more pervasive character than I thought he would be. Anytime something happens on DS9 and the Cardassians get involved, it has to be him. And as I typed this I just realized it's because he used to command the station. Also this is the episode where I think I realized everybody got a promotion, not just Sisko.

Rejoined: This episode hurt so much. Dax loves recklessly. I no longer want her to be with Julian. Julian would take care of her the way Miles cares for Keiko and she would get bored. Dax has lived so many lives that she needs constant adventure, and if loving frantically gives that to her, then fine by me. I loved the scene with her and Sisko where he tells her that if she decides to get back with ex wife, he's with her all the way. It's one of the few Sisko scenes that really got me. But I get the feeling I'm going to warm up to Sisko. He was much, much more powerful in this set of episodes. It felt like he had a real purpose. Like in the Visitor, his relationship with his son wasn't as simple and straightforward as it usually felt to me. But I loved him breaking down telling Dax that he believes in the choices she makes. That was lovely.

ETA: This blog may become a little more sporadic. My life just sort of upended (in a good, but very chaotic way) so I won't have as much time to watch.

13,Just Another Show Pitch: Star Trek: SAR,1591371463,"Starfleet has historically been heavily involved in exploration, scientific advancement, engineering, diplomacy, and defense, but the ""humanitarian aid"" line from *Star Trek* (2009) from Captain Pike strikes me as a great opportunity to adapt and improve the rescue procedural television show concept: **search and rescue**. 

The concept could use the traditional Star Trek idea of following the senior crew of a ship, but the mission would explicitly be the interstellar version of maritime search and rescue (as opposed to something like combat or urban). The ship would be purpose-built to be tough and adaptable in order to deal with dangerous spatial phenomena, with a phenomenal series of sensors, tractor beams, and transporters. It wouldn't need much in the way of armament because largely Starfleet SAR operations happen within Federation Space. There would be no military antagonists, rather the antagonist on the show would be things like a ticking clock or a dangerous rescue requiring out of the box thinking. And the officers and crew would be people of unparalleled courage and motivated by fulfillment of their purpose to help those most in need. 

I don't know that it'd need seven seasons and a movie, necessarily, but a limited series with standalone rescue episodes or the occasional multi-episode arc for a particularly dangerous and/or challenging rescue would be fun. 

So why this? While I don't have a problem as a rule with battles and combat driving the story, some of my favorite episodes are ""Balance of Terror"" and ""Best of Both Worlds"", I do think that Star Trek provides an opportunity for other challenges to drive the story and character growth, and can be every bit as interesting. Instead of having sentient beings trying to hurt each other, SAR is about compassion-driven heroism, the idea that every life is precious. 

Ideas for rescue: 

* A heavy freighter hauling vital agricultural equipment to a new settlement can't get out of the way of an unforecasted ion storm in time, and SAR needs to not only rescue the crew but also figure out how to safe the equipment. 

* A family transport suffers catastrophic reactor failure and is forced to crash land on a Class H planet with a particularly corrosive atmosphere, and the SAR ship can't enter the atmosphere without itself succumbing to the corrosion. 

* The pilot flying the first warp-capable ship of an emergent civilization comes out of warp in a particularly dangerous asteroid field, and SAR is the only ship close enough to not only rescue but make first contact. 

* A multi-episode arc in which our hero ship must work with other SAR ships to deal with a galaxy-class ship that is stuck half-inside a spatial anomaly of unknown properties, which turns out to be a new layer of subspace that has unique fundamental laws. 

* A Jem'Hadar refinery thought destroyed on a barely-charted moon finally manages to put together a distress signal, but the soldiers and their Vorta are unaware that the Dominion War has been over for years. They've just been manufacturing ketracel white and have been learning how to grow and mine the raw ingredients, along with metalurgy and such, for years. SAR is first on the scene.

19,I had a wacky dream last night for a Voyager S9 &amp; S10 concept. Here's the elevator pitch!,1591368224,"***Just a heads up for anyone not completed Voyager and Picard, this will contain spoilers.***

&amp;nbsp;

**Logline**

An attack that changes the core of the Federation leads Admiral Janeway to the Beta Quadrant, where evidence of an alternate Voyager's path home will aid her fight.

&amp;nbsp;

**Season 9 Arc**

Set shortly after the events in Picard, our antagonist Annorax (Year Of Hell) uses the Krenim Time Ship to remove life from Earth, preventing Voyager from interfering in the restoration of the Krenim Imperium.

&amp;nbsp;

Meanwhile, in drydock around Jupiter, USS Voyager is at the end of its scientific analysis and is being prepped for transport to Earth. It's during the commemoration of the scientific work with Admiral Janeway and Captain Riker in attendance, that a temporal shock wave is detected. Janeway remembers the warning Kes gave about the Krenim (cont?) and raises the Temporal shielding, saving the the inhabitants of Voyager but the rest of humanity is gone.

(bullet points from here on out, unless people want to hear more)

&amp;nbsp;

* The crew is a mixture of retired/senior officers and civilians, some are out of touch with modern starship operation
* Janeway becomes Captain, with Riker becoming First Officer. Though not all officers agree, there are more senior retired officers on board after all...
* Q shows Janeway crew logs from an alternate timeline where Voyager took 23 years to return home
* Q's clues point to an unexplored region of space in the Beta Quadrant where local spacetime phenomena mean that this alternate timeline still exists, and alternate Voyager passed through it
* The logs discuss a timeship prototype developed by Voyager in collaboration with the inhabitants called the Vilhelk (that's what the dream called them...), getting this ship is the priority of the season
* The Vilhelk don't seem all open and honest, the external observer will wonder how Voyager ever made friends with them
* However the trip is long and hard as Voyager has to work through an Alpha/Beta quadrant that never had a federation. Klingon's and Romulan's now have different histories

&amp;nbsp;

**Season 10 Arc**

This season is started when Voyager reaches the bubble of alternate timeline. This arc is the return to home to confront Annorax, and shows the earliest beginnings of the timeship era (2800's).

* The Voyager-Vilhelk prototype timeship is still being worked on as a solution to getting Voyager home earlier, it's taken longer than anyone thought to complete so it's still in a prototype state
* There are nice touches like using Tuvok's voice as the computer voice for the prototype
* While alternate Voyager abandoned the work and resumed course to home. Others volunteered to stay behind, Icheb being the lead amongst other Voyager crew (open to suggestions here for who it should be)
* Work continues anew on the timeship, and is completed, though it has large limitations, such as being unable to timeshift more than a few minutes before reverting to normal quickly
* The journey back to the Alpha Quadrant begins with the timeship and the eventual conflict with the Krenim/Annorax
* (bit lighter on detail as I was starting to wake up, so need a bit more plot)

Super excited to join the community. Growing up my mother always watched TNG and I never had an interest. I found it boring and slow. Became a huge star wars fan instead and never bothered with Star Trek (sorry for the insolence). Though I did go to a couple of the movies with her. 

For some reason in the last couple weeks I decided to give it a go. I tried to start with TOS and watched about 3 episodes which I did enjoy. But with the low budget and acting styles I got impatient and moved on to TNG (after consulting this subs sidebar for guidance). Well I watched all of season one in less than a week, mostly excited for Riker’s beard to come into play because I remembered how glorious it was, I’m glad I didn’t have to wait too long. My mom completely understood of course. 

Well, halfway through season two in a little over a week and it’s safe to say I’m hooked and super excited. I told my mom I started watching and had no idea she has kept up with every new series and episode, she’s not much of a tv watcher more of a gamer these days. 

I’m excited to begin this journey, I’m a deep lover of philosophy and it’s everywhere in the show, in every episode. In fact, the show creates an ideal future I’ve often envisioned and pondered about. I just finished Samaritan Snare and wasn’t all that surprised that Picard had shared a philosophical text with Ensign Crusher and Picard places an emphasis on the difficulty yet importance to a great Star Fleet leader in understanding philosophy, history, etc.

I’m excited to get to the movies with TNG cast but, the sidebar info recommends watching all of TNG, DS9, and Voyager before getting to those movies. I had thought it would make sense to watch the movies as there were released within the series or at the very least right after. Is there a good place between seasons for me to watch the movies or should I follow that guide?

The season 2 story arc however is a solid ""YES.""  In fact, I would put the storyline up there with Asimov or Bradbury any day.  No spoilers, but the nature of The Red Angel And the final resolution of the season are a great Sci Fi story.

Sadly, the episode would probably waste this idea, by keeping it a single episode, with the focus on Sisko debating the ethics of killing Quarak to bring back Quark and Garak, which he would of course go through with.

76,Are Star Trek Fans Uniquely Obsessed with Continuity?,1591286570,"Browsing YouTube I get the occasional video suggestion for [Major Grin](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC70RHgm8FoCkN2163piIfVg/videos), who is one of those more interesting Trek-themed YouTubers I see. As one of the many with misgivings about the modern Trek era of Discovery and Picard, a lot of his videos like to do comparisions between ""NuTrek"" and the past shows to point out contradictions and discrepancies on characters, Starfleet/Federation policy, customs and a whole bunch of random things. I've personally never been that intrigued by his stuff because those videos kinda come off as nit-picking, going through the history of the show and using one moment or another to say ""This is wrong!"" to the current stuff. But in general I can't help but notice that continuity, be it ""but in Episode 7 of Season 5 of Voyager..."" little details or disputes about lore concepts or design choices often having a major part in fan criticism of the series as a whole.

The most common continuity-driven issue I've seen float around the fandom is the desire to adhere to the TOS aesthetic for 23rd Century media, something that first showed up with the Kelvin-style redesigns of the Abrams films and really became persistent when Discovery first launched, then re-introduced the original Enterprise NCC-1701 (no A,B,C,D, etc). Now I understand the impulse after the precedent that TNG's ""Relics"", DS9's ""Tribblations"", and ENT's ""Mirror Darkly"" set for painstaking recreations of the original series sets, costumes &amp; what have you to maintain the retro-style aesthetic, but it also seems fair to understand the production point of view to ""update"" the setting and exercise a bit of homaging-focused creativity in designing the world, particularly to help sell the show to new fans. Coming in from following Star Wars and Doctor Who for years, I personally did feel TOS looked dated and understood wanting to give the era a fresh coat of paint, and didn't quite feel the same concern about redesigns (Star Wars having already had a rather timeless-looking fancy aesthetic by 1977 and Doctor Who having managed something similar alongside modest tweaks when revisiting ""classic"" TARDIS looks, for example). Do i emphasize and understand? Yes, but I do feel that such things could be considered an overreaction when every Trek production is free to make their own choices on how the world looks.

Now as for story/lore continuity complaints, that's more of an interesting issue for me. In some ways Trek might be unique in dealing with its long-running story due to a straightforward narrative that doesn't allow for ""easy"" accidental contradictions like, say, Dr. Who's time-travel-inducing headaches. The path is straight throughout and all behind the writers, and it's just up to keeping notes for them to maintain consistency, a seemingly simple task (though maybe some of the long-running soap operas might beg to differ, I have no idea). But with all the details going across centuries of chronological storytelling, as well as the gaps from years not covered in the stories told, issues like whether the TOS Enterprise could've carried repair drones or had holo-screen tech in semi-common capacity, if Picard's actions line up with his morals as well as progression across TNG and the films, or if treatment of characters is ignoring or disrespecting their in-universe reputation or legacy are matters that feel like grey area to leave solid judgement. There could be issues, but there could be answers that can just hand-wave it or be considered as overthinking minor matters compared to the plot's intent. I've read a fair bit about Raffi in Picard and her addiction and relative poverty, for example, and how these things *shouldn't* be problems in Federation Earth anymore, how it could be excused as personal choice or small things that slip through the cracks of utopia, how worth it is something like this to be done in a Trek story, etc. The debates and points of view can go on and on.

Frequently I read interviews or quotes from Trek writers, as well as other long-running franchises like Dr. Who or Marvel/DC comics, where it can feel overbearing or frustrating to write new entries in the series when the perceptions of continuity feel restrictive to what they want to do. A fan might counter that imagination can flourish in such constrictions when thinking outside the box or something, but it still runs into the matter that not all Trek writers are major fans with concerns for double-checking Memory Alpha for every little idea or choice they have. Besides, when details slip outside a screenwriter's control and go into choices of set dressing, costuming, acting choices or whatever else have you, oversight for continuity can easily become a tremendous task for even a dedicated team to handle. Even Star Wars, which post EU-reboot has promoted a story team that makes all ""canon"" media consistent with one another, still messes up with matters like details in movie novelizations not lining up (apparently Rey meets Poe for the first time twice in the TFA and TLJ novels).

There's a lot to cover with this question, and with my limited understanding as a newer fan I couldn't begin to summarize it all, but in general I'm just curious as to how much continuity and the consistency of every little detail of Star Trek matters to people. Is this unique to us compared to other franchises, or at least of a greater concern than with most other media? How much ""should"" it be an issue when things don't line up, and what's the line between genuine story/lore concerns or just minor nitpicking?",startrek,Drewsko199,False,/r/startrek/comments/gwk9nh/are_star_trek_fans_uniquely_obsessed_with/
77,"Why did the Borg do ""First Contact"", and how could the attack possibly have failed?",1591286340,"The Borg and the Federation are a causality loop.

Problem is, the message the Borg sent to the Delta Quadrant wasn't just a ""something interesting is here guys"", but actually contains the knowledge of (at the very least) the events of First Contact. I don't remember what Archer says about the transition, but we know this because 7 knows the name of the Phoenix because ""The Borg were there."" There is no way 7 could know the Borg were at First contact without knowledge from the past (FC happened after Voyager got stranded, which is why the rest of the crew don't know about it).

So my question is, wouldn't the Borg be able to learn from what went wrong and do First Contact differently every single time until they get it right? The Borg should functionally have infinite tries, provided at least one Borg survives each go to send a message, and the Enterprise would have to win each and every try. If all collective knowledge was transmitted, then does that mean they should have won Wolf 359 AND taken Earth by the same logic? Do the Borg just have a fantastic respect for the timeline?

80,"Long Time Star Trek Fan Finally Watches DS9: Season 3, episodes 23-26",1591284565,"Guys it took me so, so long to start remembering not to trust new characters because they could be changlings. This is the what... 3rd time they’ve tried to drive that message home? Whoops.

In order:
Family Business: boy I hate the message of this episode. I totally get that they are trying to show the opposite of what quark says- they’re talking about resistance and how change is slow and difficult. I just don’t like the way the ferengi are used for that. I’m still trying to like Quark but he is just so unwilling to evolve- just like when he sabotages Nog’s test. I totally understand that this is the point they’re trying to make with these episodes, it just doesn’t work for me, personally.

Shakaar: guys I just want Kira to stop having to fight for basic, fundamental rights. I also felt like she gave up in the beginning a little bit. When Winn ordered the farmers arrested, I wish she would have contacted Sisko instead of saying, “WOOPS guess I’m a resistance leader again.” And even though I do agree with what she did AFTER that, and think it was as right as it could have been at that point, there were still zero consequences. None from the Bajoran military who she technically works for and none from Sisko (although honestly, what would he do?). I don’t know what they would have been but I’m constantly struck in this show by the zero consequence policy. I did overall like this episode though, and I’m glad we knocked Winn down a peg. I am also curious of how involved or not Kira and Sisko, by proxy, should be involved in Bajoran politics. Obviously Sisko is very little because of the Prime Directive but I feel like he is, in some ways, responsible for Kira. And why doesn’t Odo get more involved?

Facets: there were parts of this I liked a lot and parts I didn’t. I loved getting to know Dax’s previous hosts. The gymnast, the indulgent one, the mother- it brings so much dimension to her personality. I am, however, disappointed with how they portrayed the composer and Curzon. I guess I imagined the composer as a good man who went a little nuts. Not a straight up horrible person. It’s interesting that we don’t see Jadzia struggle with that a little more. And Curzon is not what I expected. I expected jovial, harsh but wanting the best from people, etc. not selfish and mean. Also interesting to me that what Odo wanted wasn’t part of the discussion of whether or not Curzon would return to Jadzia. He said that Odo wanted this too. It should have weighed into the decision, in my opinion.

The Adversary: this was definitely interesting. The Founders seem pretty darn determined to start a war. This is where I realized I need to be less trusting. As far as what was actually happening, it felt pretty run of the mill for DS9- we need to avert a war. This one followed what I consider to be the “formula” for a star trek episode: a creature we don’t understand has taken control of the ship, and we have to get it back before the creature uses our ship for something bad. It wasn’t a bad episode it just wasn’t thrilling. I’m honestly more personally invested in Bajoran politics and development right now than the founders. And we seem to have forgotten about the Maquis.

81,What Are Your Favorite Star Trek Movie Moments? (Spoilers if you haven't seen them..),1591281560,"Last night, I had the incredible fortune of catching the last 25 minutes of Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country (my favorite part) on TV, so I'm curious to see what the community's favorite Star Trek movies are (and their moments). Here are my top 5.   


1. Star Trek VIII: First Contact
   1. I was born in the 90s so I grew up with Star Trek TNG. I distinctly remember going to see this movie twice (once with my late father and once with my aunt) when I was in Kindergarten. Over the years, this one has always been my favorite. 
   2. Favorite Movie Moments:
      1. ""They invade our space, and we fall back. They assimilate entire worlds, and we fall back. Not again. The line must be drawn HERE. This far, no further. And I will make them PAY for what they've done""
      2. Jerry Goldsmith's movie score throughout the entire movie, especially at the ""First Contact"" scene between 
      3. Worf's ""Assimilate This"" line  

2. Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan
   1. Again, I was born in the 90s so I saw this film later in my life. For sure, the best original Star Trek movie made.
   2. Favorite Movie Moments:
      1. James Horner's movie score surrounding the Battle of the Mutara Nebula and Genesis Countdown
      2. Spock's Death scene. Possibly the most emotional death scene I've ever seen (even topping Tony Stark's death). I would've hated rewatching this scene if I hadn't known he was coming back.
      3. ""I Don't Like to Lose"". Kirk's command style.   

3. Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country
   1. This was the first Star Trek TOS Movie I watched (I didn't watch them in order). When I was a kid, I thought the action scenes were my favorite. As I grew up, I love the actor's performances and all the Shakespearean lines.
   2. Favorite Movie Moments:
      1. The Final Battle Between The Enterprise, Excelsior, and the Klingon Bird-of-Prey. ""Cry Havoc!"" ""Target that Explosion and Fire"" ""Fire!""
      2. Dining on Ashes - Nice quiet moment between Kirk and Spock
      3. ""Your father called the future...The Undiscovered Country. People can be frightened of change"". 
      4. Their sign off. Truly amazing. I wish the characters of TNG got their moment with Nemesis.  

4. Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home
   1. This one was one of my dad's favorites. I remember he bought the VHS at Kmart, and gave it to me, and asked to watch it with me. This movie is just a blast.
   2. Favorite Movie Moments:
      1. The ""colorful metaphors"" - ""Double dumb-ass on you!""
      2. Nuclear wessels.
      3. When Admiral Kirk gets demoted to Captain. Kirk smiles at that punishment.
      4. Spock's conversation with his father, Sarek. ""It was no effort. You are my son. Besides, I am most impressed with your performance in this crisis. As I recall, I opposed your enlistment in Starfleet. It is possible that judgment was incorrect. Your associates are people of good character."" ""They are my friends."" ""Yes of course.""  

5. Star Trek VII: Generations
   1. I know some people don't like this movie; however, I get that. This one is put in there for nostalgia purposes. This is the first movie I remember seeing in the theatre (I was 3). 
   2. Favorite Movie Moments:
      1. Captains Riding Horses. Dennis McCarthy's score gives me goosebumps every time I watch this scene when Kirk jumps the ravine. I also love their little talk about ""making a difference"".
      2. The final conversation between Riker and Picard. ""Someone once told me that time was a predator that stalked us all our leves. I rather believe that time is a companion who goes with us on the journey and reminds us to cherish every moment, because it will never come again. What we leave behind is not as important as how we've lived. After all Number One, we're only mortal"". ""Speak for yourself sir, I plan to live forever.""
      3. The Bird of Prey Attack. ""We are cloaking, our shield are down!"" \*Dramatic Music\* ""Fire."" (very reminiscent of Star Trek VI)
      4. Saucer Crash. Although this move was controversial, considering it only took a few hits and dominos of bad luck, at least the saucer went out with a literal bang.
      5. Kirk's Death. Apparently, this wasn't the first idea of how he was going to go out, but it was much better than being shot. If you want to read a good sequel to ""Generations"", download the audiobook (or pick up the book) ""The Return"" by William Shatner. Yes, it's the Shatner-verse and not canon, but it's really good.

&amp;#x200B;

Honorable Mentions:

* Star Trek III: The Search for Spock
   * Stealing the Enterprise. Loved the music and the entire scene
* Star Trek IX: Insurrection
   * Lots of favorite moments here. ""A British Tar"", ""Have You Noticed Your Boobs Are Starting to Firm Up?"", and the Riker Manuever ""We're through running from these bastards.""
* Star Trek: The Motion Picture
   * The Enterprise scene where Kirk is admiring coming back to an old friend.

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, I didn't mention the Kelvin-verse. It's not that I don't like the movies; I rather enjoyed them. They were very entertaining, but that's what they were. Entertaining. They didn't speak to me like the first 10 movies did.

90,Who Watches the Watchers (TNG S3 EP4) is a crossover in spirit with Twin Peaks.,1591273327,"Not only does Ray Wise appear in both series (Liko in TNG and Leland Palmer in Twin Peaks) he plays a morally gray characters in both. In fact, Liko’s actions are mostly driven by the death of his daughter (and wife). 

In addition, about a quarter of the episode revolves around the search for “Palmer” - a federation officer observing the Minkata. Palmer is an important last name in Twin Peaks.

What’s more, the theme of the episode involves misunderstandings between the Bronze Age-level culture and the federation. There are discussions about visions, god-like characters, and their intentions. I believe this is a deliberate allusion to the style of Twin Peaks. I think the misunderstanding of the Minkata suggests a Star Trek minded solution to the phenomena in Twin Peaks.

There are also cave paintings and symbolism involving electricity in the episode. At one point Counselor Troi suggests that Ray Wise’s character was a part of a shared dream.

And although it is probably not deliberate, there is an extended scene where Riker carries Palmer away from the town and disappears. This is similar to the actions of Bob and Windom Earle. Personally, I think he could have energized immediately after leaving the communal hut, but I guess they wanted the chase scene.

We have seen mobile holo-emitters worn by AIs with bodies consisting of holograms and force fields (the doctor from voyager). We have also seen entire ships in the future of the Trek universe are basically holodecks, with emitters in every room (Picard).   


Therefore, what is to stop a human from walking through a transporter arch, coming out the other end not in real space, but virtual space? Reconstituted not from real matter, but virtual matter?

17,A Star Trek newbie reviews the TOS movies and TNG Season 1,1591232820,"Hi, Trekkies. I've returned to this sub again to continue my Viewer's Log, journaling my experience exploring the franchise as a newbie. My previous post - a review of TOS, and previously before that, *The Cage -* can be found here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/gg3q9d/a\_star\_trek\_newbie\_reviews\_the\_original\_series/](https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/gg3q9d/a_star_trek_newbie_reviews_the_original_series/)

It's been less than a month since I finished The Original Series, and in that time I have watched the 6 TOS feature films and all of The Next Generation season 1. As my newbie status becomes less and less, well...new...my thoughts vary. I'll try to keep it short as I can, but here we go. OBVIOUSLY, SPOILERS GALORE. 

**THE 6 ORIGINAL SERIES FEATURES**

*Star Trek The Motion Picture* \- I jumped into this just hours after finishing ""Turnabout Intruder"". I Googled a quick concesus to find mostly negative reviews, and I must say I highly, highly disagree with all of them. I loved, loved, loved this film. Sure, it's basically a stretched version of ""The Changeling"" from TOS, but that was one of my favorite episodes. I love Star Trek at it's most philosophical, and my favorite movie of all time is *2001: A Space Odyssey*, so a 2 hour slow burner about computer that wants to become sentient filled with long acid trips is right up my alley. I actually like this movie so much I bought the blu ray right away, and I have watched it again. I could right a post 1000 words long about just this film, so I'll cut it off with saying I give it an 8.5/10 and think the bad reviews are from people who wanted Star Trek to be Star Wars (my stepfather-to-be calls it ""The Motionless Picture"")

*Wrath of Khan -* This movie is a classic at this point, and it's praises have been sung to the high heavens by everyone. I don't love it unconditionally like everyone else does, and I had actually seen it many years ago before watching the series, but I think it's still great. My biggest gripe with it is the fact that Chekov seems to know who Khan is even though he wasn't in ""Space Seed"". The writer(s) could have easily got around this by simple giving Chekov's role to Sulu, and I don't know why they didn't. 7.5/10

*Search for Spock* \- Once again, I disagree with the concesus. There's definitely some issues with this one, and the big fight at the end with Kirk is terrible, but I still enjoyed it a lot, having watched it back to back with WoK. In particular, I love the last act, and like my defense of ""Turnabout Intruder"", I think is one of only a few Star Trek stories that brings up Kirk's questionable morals. He essentially trades his son for his friend, and I find Spock's return moving, but highly questionable under the circumstance. To me, this kind of moral quandary is the heart of Star Trek, not all the shooting and action that was in WoK. 8/10.

*The Voyage Home -* I'm still having trouble deciding if this or The Motion Picture is my favorite. Roger Ebert summed it up perfectly when he said that Nimoy directed it with ""calm professionalism"". This film is practically perfect. I can't think of a single thing I don't like about it, other than maybe that it's a little long. The Scotty/McCoy/Glass case subplot probably could have been a little condensed. I know I said I like TMP for it's slow pace, so maybe I'm contradicting myself here, but it doesn't matter that much. I loved this one to the heavens, and the ending had me smiling in a way I never do at movies. Glorious, fun, pure Trek. 8.5/10

*The Final Frontier* \- Way to go, Shatner. 5/10.

*The Undiscovered Country -* I don't know why this one isn't more talked about. It's great, and it was refreshing after the 5th movie was 107 minutes of Shatner farting into the lens. A solid, suspenseful mystery, and brining back director Nicolas Meyer was a smart choice. I actually watched the first few episodes of TNG before this, so this answered all my questions on how the Klingons became less Isis-like - I was curious after being introduced to Warf. A fitting end to the original series and it's cast, and overall I was very satisfied. 8/10.

I did not watch *Generations.* I want to wait till I'm in the 7th season of TNG to watch it, since that's when everyone else saw it. From what I gather though, it seems like most people don't like it, and the stills I've seen make me wonder if James Dohaan needed more money to retire. *Christ*, he's old. 

My ranking of the TOS movies goes like this.

1) A hard tie between *The Motion Picture* and *The Voyage Home*

2) *The Undiscovered Country*

3) *Wrath of Khan*

4) *Search for Spock*

5) *The Final Shatner Vanity Project* 

**THE NEXT GENERATION, SEASON 1.** 

Here's my thoughts on the season 1 summed up in two words: Almost there. 

Almost as enjoyable as The Original Series, but not quite. Of the 26 episodes, most of them were bad to average, but when they were great, they were *really* great. I understand most Trek fans seem to think that the first 2 seasons of the show aren't as good as the later seasons, and I'm willing to believe that. I never wanted to give up, but there was at least 10 episodes where I just kind of passively watched while I was on my phone or doing laundry or something because it wasn't very interesting. 

WHAT I LIKE: 

The same dichotomy that made the original cast work so well still exists here. Data is the new Spock, LaForge is the new Sulu. All the characters (except one, which I'll get to) are likable and although it took me a while to warm up to them being so used to the TOS cast, I feel at home with all of them now. 

WHAT I DON'T LIKE:

1) The look and sound. I know it can't look the same, but the absence of that gorgeous technicolor cinematography, the glossy lighting, and colorful set design is very disappointing. I know they had to update to look for the late 80s, when cable as a whole was pivoting to video, but it often looks so plain. The first color I think of when I think of this show is grey. Not very exciting. 

The Original Series had such great music. Yes, very 60s, but it used it sparsely and was almost composed like a soundtrack to an epic film. It was always reminded me of, say, a Douglas Sirk movie or something. Aside from the theme (which is just a recycle for TMP), I can't recall a single piece of music out of 26 episodes that stood out. 

2) The idea of having families with children aboard The Enterprise. Sorry, but this seems horribly misguided to me. Wesley I can understand, but how can Starfleet justify having hundreds of children on a ship that essentially act as a warship and can be subject to spontaneous bursts of enemy fire. I know the ship can separate now, but my point still stands.  

3) Picard. I'm sorry, but I don't like Captain Picard or his role in the show. Stewart's performance is serviceable, but he's a pipsqueak compared to Captain Kirk. He's never affirmative, never seems to make *any* decision without 5 different opinions from his team, and, worst of all, he always seems to make everyone else do the dirty work for him. I don't think there was a single episode of The Original Series where Kirk didn't beam down with the rest of the team, and wasn't on the frontline of the mission leading the way to the next objective (except for when he was captured, of course). In most of these episodes, Picard always sends an away team and watches them struggle from his chair. only intervening when it gets really bad, or when the mission intercepts with someone or something personal to him. This is what annoyed me the most out of everything in the series, and I really, really hope this changes as the series goes on or else I might not continue. 

GENERAL THOUGHTS:

The best episodes are at the tail end of the season. The beginning is spotty, and there's about 10 or 11 stinkers in a row in the middle of the season. I don't know how much Gene Roddenberry was contributing to the writing here, but for most of it, I felt like his touch was missing. As where I was instantly hooked on watching the rest of TOS immediately after ""The Cage"" and ""Charlie X"", it took me a few episodes to get hooked here. It's just...not quite up to par, though there are many highlights. 

MY FAVORITE EPISODES: 

""The Neutral Zone""

""Conspiracy""

""Justice""

""Haven""

""Symbiosis"" 

""11001001""

""Datalore""

The pilot, ""Encounter At Farpoint"", was pretty great except for the ending. Jellyfish? What? Also a lot of Q's dialogue made me cringe. 

I like ""Justice"" and ""Symbiosis"" in particular. ""Justice"" is essentially a riff on state laws and corporal punishment, and I love it when Trek gets political. That's why ""Symbiosis"" was probably my absolute favorite. I loved that the show was willing to frame Picard as the moral opposer here, and though I'm not sure who I agree with, I've thought about this one the most since finishing the season. 

""Skin of Evil"" I'm quite indifferent towards. I loved the character of Yar and was sad to see her go, but the monster was pretty corny and it talked too much. I love the idea of this episode, but the execution was wobbly. 

MY LEAST FAVORITE EPISODES: 

""Home Soil""

""We'll Always Have Paris""

""Lonely Among Us""

""Angel One""

""Code of Honor""

""The Naked Now""

""The Big Goodbye"" - Probably the worst. It's all fake so who cares? 

Like last time, I've rambled on too long already. With six seasons ahead of me, it will probably be a while before I return for another log entry, but thanks to all the folks in this sub who engaged with my last post.

28,"Justice, the message of Picard, and how it feels after this week",1591220199,"I hesitate to compare Picard's themes to actual, lethal prejudice, but since the show was directly influenced by modern politics I feel like it's A. fair, and B. worth exploring.

And the main thing I've been thinking about since the finale aired, something most of us have been thinking about over the last week, is the concept of justice- things don't just fix themselves overnight, it takes a lot of work by a lot of people to change systems and earn justice for people who have been wronged, whether that takes the form of gradual political change or active resistance to oppression. It's never black and white, never easy, and always morally compromised in one way or another. Even in the utopia of classic Trek, justice only existed because there were people (like Picard) constantly fighting for it, and empowering people to earn it for themselves.

But what bothered me about PIC was how notably absent that is. For all it set up about victims and prejudice, it doesn't really seem to care about what those things mean beyond people wanting to kill people. The central conflict, saving Soji and the rest of the synths, extends only as far as stopping the Zhat Vash from killing them, and never once even mentions what their future might look like if they survive. The show in general has a weird obsession with ""saving"" victims, but more in the act of saving them than in what happens after. In a sense, the XBs feel like its ideal victims - they don't think or act for themselves, they exist only to be saved by the good guys and killed by the bad guys - where in contrast, the synths are bad victims because they resist in the only way they can, and the Romulan refugees are bad victims because some of them responded with prejudice of their own. Instead of confronting what makes the synths resist and makes the refugees resentful, Picard spends just about all of his screen time criticizing them.

This is why Picard's ""save each other"" speech didn't land for me at all. For all the flowery language he uses, all he's really saying is ""stop resisting and hope that the people in power decide to help you, and the people who hate you change their minds"" (of course, the genocide vs. genocide conflict is so abstract and exagerrated that it's hard to talk about nuance). In the end, the whole climax is orchestrated just to let Picard save people, but, again, all that really means is allowing them to live.

It makes me really wish that instead of the show giving itself softballs like ""genocide is bad"" and then patting itself on the back for being morally superior to the desperate victims it created, it had some interest in exploring what it actually looks like for those victims to not just be ""saved"", not just be helped in a real systemic way, but help themselves. It makes me wish that Picard had the chance to fight for them and with them instead of lecturing them and solving everything with one vague speech. It makes me wish (and excuse the hot take) resisting oppression wasn't caricatured into ""the Destroyer"".

And with all this in mind, as thousands of people are out in the streets calling for justice, because they know that you don't earn it by waiting to be saved, there are some questions on my mind-

- What is the show trying to tell the people who identify not with Picard, but with Soji?
- What do the Zhat Vash represent, beyond evil cultists?
- What does an aspirational utopia look like in modern sci-fi?
- What will be the cultural legacy of this era of Star Trek?",startrek,IllustriousDonger,False,/r/startrek/comments/gw39sc/justice_the_message_of_picard_and_how_it_feels/

36,Long Time Star Trek Fan Finally Watches DS9: season 3 episodes 18-22,1591208023,"I don’t have questions today in particular but as always, I’d love to hear other thoughts on the episodes! We’ll go one at a time today.

We got a lot of Julian in this set starting with Distant Voices. Now, I see what they were doing here, but I don’t think it was done well. First off, everything was stated explicitly. He went through and identified which part of himself the other characters represented which was just awkward to me. We are very capable of figuring that out. I felt like it also left out parts of him that at least I personally considered major traits, like intense and driving compassion. Vaguely Garak stands in for some sense of compassion by being the one to help but... not really. It came across as arrogant to me. The one part I thought was clever was when Julian realized he needed to go to the infirmary to fix his station, because that’s the center of his personal world. 

I don’t have much to say about Through the Looking Glass. I’m just really not that invested in Sisko. I know they were trying to show that passion he still has for his wife. It wasn’t a bad episode per say it just wasn’t terribly thrilling to me.

We got some GARAK! At first I was mildly annoyed that Julian wasn’t more involved with the episodes here again because I like the way they interact, but I like what it became. The way he works with Odo makes me actually believe he’s on the Federation’s side. I don’t believe a word he says out loud, but I don’t believe he wanted to stay with the Cardassians had the raid been successful. I don’t doubt at all that he is miserable on DS9, but I don’t believe he would prefer to go back into a position of power on Cardassia, either. I thought it was interesting how Julian’s role slipped effortlessly from codebreaker to friend. I will say that if Garak was exiled because he betrayed someone in the Obsidian Order I’m disappointed but I get the feeling that’s not it.

As for Odo’s role in those episodes, it was kind of intriguing. I wondered why he didn’t tell Sisko as soon as he realized Garak blew up his own shop, but then I realized that Sisko would have shut down the game, and Odo wanted to play. I also wondered why Garak wanted Odo’s involvement and I honestly still don’t have an answer to that one. Garak can clearly pull strings and get what he wants. If he wanted a runabout, Julian would have given it to him, few questions asked and no answers given. So clearly, Garak wanted Odo. 

And finally for those episodes, I cheered when Sisko contacted Star Fleet command and died a little when they disobeyed orders (I mean of course they were going to, but...). There are just no consequences for anyone in this show. 

And lastly, for Explorers- Guys, I couldn’t care less about Sisko and his kid recreating an old Bajoran folk tale. If I’ve learned one thing from this show, it’s that Bajoran legends/stories/prophecies are true and there’s no point in questioning them. As I was watching this episode, I thought I was going to write about how Julian’s constant fear of being second best/not quite good enough is hitting too close to home for me and getting uncomfortable (I’m a very competitive student, just lost a major scholarship competition) but then we got him and Miles drunkenly singing sea chanties and it made my life. As the kind of person that enjoys a good sea chanty even when sober, this was just a good time. “And that really comes from the heart- I don’t hate you anymore!” Their message at the end is that perfect isn’t always the best was not my favorite but I tried to let it be mildly comforting.

37,Unpopular opinion about the Ferengi and DS9,1591208001,"I'm prepared for the d-votes.

I'm on episode 16 of season 4, Bar Association. This entire time I've been rooting for for Quark and the Ferengi. And this episode really just took me over the edge. Sure, they'd mention how greedy and unscrupulous they are. I can kinda gloss over that, ""Maybe they'll show some positive aspects of their society in the future."" But this last episode took the cake.

The Ferengi are supposed to be in juxtaposition to the Earth and the Federation. That capitalism leads to misery, misogyny, and a stagnation in culture. And that socialism, or communism even is put up on a pedestal. Even though we still see rivalrous activity, admirals backstabbing and lying. A quasi military coupe on Earth that Sisko somehow discovers and puts the kibosh on with a series of good luck and chance. In real life, the backstabbers would have several of those battles and the perfect utopia would be thrown into chaos. That's the biggest issue with Star Trek's vision of a free future devoid of want. Liars and backstabbers would take over and have the edge on the innocent and trusting.

Off of that tangent for a moment. The episode in question is about Rom striking against Quark, because Quark cut everyone's salary due to the Bajoran's 1 month fasting or lent type of holiday. Rom gets the smart idea that he should form a union, which is against Ferengi law. Quark and the Fernegi FCA try all sorts of unscrupulous tactics to get Rom to back down. Rom doesn't back down and Quark gives him everything he wants in a secret deal. Then the final kick in the pants is that after the ordeal Rom joins the Bajoran government as a technician working on the station, but he'll still fix the things that break down at Quarks, because he's such a good guy, and there's nothing that a union man could ever do wrong.

They make it so childishly and insultingly black and white. Union good, business man bad. It's not that way in real life. Unions also use violence to obtain what they want. They kidnap CEOs, and use weapons to prevent people from working. While unionizing a bar has little external consequence, the truckers strike in Brazil had huge widespread consequences. People starved and the country itself shut down. Then, of course in Star Trek, what the unions asked for was completely reasonable and fair. Look at unions in real life, dude. Teachers unions for instance. They've made it so fucking hard to fire teachers it's not even worth it. I had a teacher in high school who received fallacio from a student, but finished the school year out before he resigned. Her parents were loaded and they moved to Germany. This isn't an isolated incident either, do your research. Sometimes unions go way too far in their protections.

Now, this isn't to say business men are as clean as the wind driven snow. It is to say that life isn't in black and white. Unions are necessary at times in certain areas and that the push and pull between labor and capital is a lot more delicate and interesting than DS9 makes it out to be.

Maybe Star Trek isn't for me. I went through the full TNG series recently and moved onto DS9. TNG was great, it was look wrapping myself up in a nice soft blanket from my childhood. Frankly, the writing was a lot cleaner. The Prime Directive was so beautiful in that show. It held onto the liberal ideas of the 80's and 90's that you can't force a different kind of people to respect your laws and customs even when you know it's for the best. You need to do your best to respect different cultures and on their own they'll adapt. Of course, there was a line in the sand there that would get crossed from time to time and they needed to intervene.

OK, now I'm getting off topic. I could go on and on. I guess the bottom line is, I hate how binary they make the Ferengi. It's not interesting and it's insulting.",startrek,Sonington,False,/r/startrek/comments/gvz64d/unpopular_opinion_about_the_ferengi_and_ds9/

Recently, civil unrest has spread through the US. The situation that precipitated this was not one isolated incident, and was merely the straw that broke the camel's back. Star Trek Deep Space Nine, over 25 years ago, dedicated itself to spreading a message of equality and humanity.

&amp;#x200B;

All of the members of Project Defiant are at a loss for words. We may not be able to singlehandedly change history in the fight for equality, but we can contribute in out own way. We've dedicated the past few days to performing the highest quality upscale that we can manage for four of the most relevant episodes. These are:

* s03e11	Past Tense, part 1
* s03e12	Past Tense, part 2
* s03e02	The Visitor
* s06e13	Far Beyond the Stars

&amp;#x200B;

DS9 always strived for equality, and three of these episodes speak for themselves in their relevance. We decided to also include The Visitor, as we believe that it humanizes Sisko and his son Jake, reminding us that even in times of extreme pain, the future is only what we make of it.

# Release notes

Important update: Due to popular demand, we will not be releasing Season 3 on its own. **We will release the rest of the series together** **once all of the conversions are completed**. If you are interested in seeing any season before we've released it, feel free to send me a message here on Reddit.

&amp;#x200B;

We've gone back to our original plan of doing 4K upscaling, but we'll only be releasing the episodes in 1080p with H265 encoding. This way we maximize the quality while minimizing the file size.

&amp;#x200B;

If you want to help:

&gt;Send me a direct message here on reddit. Minimum requirements for upscaling: Windows 10, GTX 1080 GPU, 8 GB of RAM. Unfortunately Topaz Lab's software doesn't yet support AMD GPU's, so it's NVIDIA or bust! Each episode can take around of 18 hours to process, depending on your computer, so make sure that the conversion process won't cause you any problems or get in the way of other things you need to do on the computer.

&amp;#x200B;

How to get it:

This is the tricky part. DS9 is the property of CBS, and we want you to show them how much you love it; so please buy it from a retailer before proceeding, only then will they consider doing a full remaster. You should never download any media that you don't already own. Furthermore, downloading anything from the internet can pose a great risk to you and should never be done without a VPN. With that being said, the upscale is available on a specific public torrent site. I won't mention which one publicly, as I don't wish to break any rules here. It is possible to find it on Google by searching ""Star Trek Deep Space 9 (Project Defiant Special Release) AI Upscale 1080p+ (2020)"" (quotation marks included). You may contact me privately for more information.

As always, all feedback is welcome!

45,“The Spectre Of The Gun” - First Time Viewing Reaction,1591187266,"Noob Trek 61 - The Spectre Of The Gun

Tune in this week when you’ll hear Kirk utter the immortal words “Feel the material in my shirt!”

interesting title. I have no idea what it’s about. Hopefully it’s not actually about the crew being haunted by a gun ghost... on second thoughts that’s an amazing idea.

The little double helix spaceship thing is cool. Lovely lighting effects. In fact this is generally a really good looking and sounding episode, with a well picked supporting cast too. Seems the director knew what they were doing. However, Kirk’s disregard of the warning of the apparently formidable Melkotians seems uncharacteristically reckless, and done to create plot. Also: “We come in peace.” \*raises gun\* The Melkotian through the fog is kind of corny and creepy at the same time.

Er, what? OK, I did not see this Wild West thing coming. But I have to say I’m a bit disappointed that such an eerie setup turned into another parallel Earth thing. Nice atmosphere though, with the red sky, the incomplete buildings, and the whistling wind. I like the little touches which create an engagingly surreal vibe, like the clock hanging in the air, and how the Earps stand unnaturally motionlessly outside at the finale, stepping into line with the others like clockwork.

OMG, the lesson the Melkotians are teaching is amazing. They are drawing a parallel between how Kirk’s ancestors roamed through the west, reforming the land and disenfranchising the natives for profit and bringing violence and Weaponry, to what Kirk is doing now in the name of the federation. This is clever. Although it turns out that what I just wrote is incorrect and actually not the point of the episode at all and I’m getting ahead of myself with my predictions. I still kinda like my idea though.

The crew’s magical familiarity with any relevant historical information always bugs me. It would be more plausible for Spock to have a little history computer which tells him these things. It is a great setting though. Actor playing Morgan Earp really looks the part. The bartender is great too. Virgil Earp is magnificent. I’m not so sold on Wyatt, who seems lethargic and like he’s been sipping the laudanum. Doc Holiday is a bit wooden. But they do the job well - there is something stiff and robotic to their performances, but I could credit that this is intentional. As with the set, there’s an uncanny valley thing going on here, and I feel the actors are acknowledging that they are simulacra with their performance.

It seems I judged too quickly when I grumbled that this was another parallel earth story. The unreal nature of things gives it a unique flavour, and they‘re playing to this being a flawed simulation well, rather than it being another inexplicably uncanny recreation of earth. Although when Sylvia starts fretting after Billy, “Billy don’t be a hero, don’t be a fool with your life“ starts looping in my head which disrupts the atmosphere somewhat.

Great scene in the dentist’s, though it’s a good thing I know my OK Corral history or this might be hard to follow at times as the episode never explains who Doc Holliday is or what he has to do with dentistry. (I partly know it from The Gunfighters, an execrable Doctor Who serial with more or less the same story, but this is easily better, mostly because it doesn’t have that damned song in it. Anyone who has seen The Gunfighters, one of the worst Doctor Who stories ever, knows what I’m talking about. ”It’s your last chance of nothing at the last chance AROON AROON AROON.”)

Nice that they give Chekhov the love story instead of Kirk for once. Chekov’s youthful exuberance suits it. The only problem is it doesn’t go anywhere and Sylvia just winks out of existence once Chekhov gets shot. Chekhov could have been shot for any reason and the episode would play out the same. I thought exploring Chekov’s reaction to developing feelings for a woman who doesn’t exist would be interesting, but nope. Scotty seems to get the short end of the stick here - Doohan doesn’t do anything wrong, the character just seems surplus to requirements. Shatner on the other hand gets to shine in an amazing scenery chewing battle when he confronts the sheriff. ”Oh so you think you can overact me do ya buddy? Well try this on for size.”

I notice this shimmering chime sound in the background at a lot of times. Is this a clue to something?

Spock reminds me of Sherlock Holmes sometimes with his “highly intelligent dick” bit. But I don’t really get the reasoning here. Scotty believed the tranquilliser was real, so why didn’t it work on him? But there’s a cool build up as a storm rages and the Earps approach and Spock mind melds with everyone in the crew to make them as cold and rational as he is so they will see through the illusion. Interesting to see how old bleeding heart McCoy will react to this. Oh he doesn’t. Shame there’s no aftermath to this, I wanted to see the crew comment on their experience of being linked with Spock.

Our big action finale is a bit of a cheat. Four guys stand there unimpressed while four other guys stand still in a row shooting bullets that don’t do anything. Gee this gunfight sure seemed a lot more dynamic in my history book.

I like how we saw Kirk try to reason with the Earps, try to tranquillise them, try to persuade the sheriff to use the law - all evidence to the Melkotians of his preference for peace. I know better by now than to ask about a follow-up as the show doesn’t seem to do sequels like that, but I’m curious as to what the Melkotians and their planet are like.

I liked this. Decent writing with more than decent production value and direction. It didn’t have as much meat on it’s bones  as it could have, I feel it was a bit light in places and could have been more profound/memorable with some further dialogue development but I still enjoyed it.

78,Long Time Star Trek Fan Finally Watches DS9: Episodes 11-17,1591124447,"This is another extra spoilery post, including character death. But so far anyone watching along with me is actually ahead so... just be aware!

Questions:
What is up with the aliens living inside the wormhole? If I remember the first episode correctly; it hurts them when things travel through it. Why are we JUST NOW hearing from them again?

This may be more of discussion than something with a clear answer but- is Kira ever going to get to stop fighting for her freedom and beliefs? She is still acting like an operative, and to be fair, people keep forcing her to. It seems like it’s always a choice: Bajor and Bajorian beliefs, or abandon that for someone else’s ideas of progress. There is a middle ground but nobody bothers to look for it. It seems like she’s starting to choose Sisko because she believes in him but I wonder if she’s losing herself.

About the orb and prophecies- is there a scientific explanation for them? Do the aliens in the wormhole have control over events on either side of it? Or did they just describe things they knew because of nonlinear time and that’s what made the “prophecies.” I’m trying to figure out if they’re like Q, or maybe even if they ARE Q honestly, or if they’re just benevolent observers.


And thoughts:
Past tense was better than I expected in a lot of ways. ST loves the “whoops we transported into the past episodes” and usually I find them confusing but this works. I will say DS9 seems to have a little more control over time travel than the other series (from Past Tense and from Visionary). I also loved Julian in both those episodes. In Visionary, he was so nonchalant. “Hey, tell past me to do this scan or you’ll die. Sorry I couldn’t save you.” And Julian in Past Tense was passionate and exhilarating like I usually find him, but learning restraint and how to be an officer from Sisko. Also in Visionary- I love the relationship between Miles and Julian. It feels very genuine. And Miles seems to have a lot of old earth hobbies...

Life Support killed me. My heart was breaking more because Kira’s was, too, not because of the loss of Bariel, though. I could sort of take or leave him but he was a good foil to Kira and an excellent tie to her religious past. There were tears.

Heart of Stone could have been incredible but it was just corny. I still love Odo. And it was a little bit heartbreaking that he knew it wasn’t Kira because she doesn’t love him and he knows it... which was the point. But they took it just a little too far for me. I did love Nog going for Star Fleet Academy though. You guys got me on that one. It was the first time I was rooting for a Ferengi. 

I have no real thoughts on Destiny except that I’m interested in Kira studying her spiritual side and how it interacts with the federation. Also suddenly this stuff is important again. Guys I just want the world for Kira and Odo, okay?

I didn’t like the Prophet Motive. I just really hate the Grand Nagus and I sort of hate the message they send. I understand that the undertone is that we, as the audience, know that what they are saying is wrong, but I just hate hearing over and over how greed is the most important feeling. I also despised the metaphor they made that ambition cannot exist without greed because I disagree with it in a very visceral way. And the situation with Julian being nominated for that award was INCREDIBLY awkward, making the entire episode uncomfortable. However, I did really like the line where Jadzia tells him he is taking the loss well, and he says that he is not. I do think that deals with an issue I’ve personally faced in my life (imposter syndrome) and I think it sends and important message about managing expectations and gracious loss. It was an important plot line. Just very, very uncomfortable.

I’d love to hear everyone’s thoughts!

He is a walking talking deus-ex-machina reset button. The writers have literally given themselves a get out of jail free card by writing an all powerful being with the ability to alter reality and change history into the show. 

If at any point Trek writes itself into a corner or (god forbid) gets to a point where fan backlash against ""new-Trek"" starts to overpower support for the show there is no canon reason that they could not simply have Q perform a soft reboot and restore the show to a more agreeable status-quo.

Yes it would be the height of jump-the-shark bad writing to do so and it is a testament to Trek writers of the last 30+ years that they have not overplayed the Q card but plenty of shows have pulled of similarly crappy ways to avoid the consequences of their writing (Heroes introducing a means to easily revive literally any character from the dead springs to mind).

8,"Re-watching ""Family"" season 4 episode 2",1591067885,"I remember at 12 years old watching this episode for the first time. The end of season 3 with Picard being abducted by the Borg and the start of season 4 with the aftermath, some of the best television I had ever seen. Then, after all that excitement there was this touchy-feely episode and I couldn't have been more annoyed. Where are the phasers, where are the photon torpedoes?

Re-watching it today, 30 years later, it's absolutely wonderful.

Picard had been through months of counselling and medical treatment, but no one would ever guess and he would never admit it to himself but he was still a broken man. He needed to go home, not to rest, not to relax, Jean-Luc needed his big brother. Robert had no idea why his the famous John Luke Picard had come back and he was quite annoyed that he did, this was the brother he was always jealous of, the brother who was even more famous today than he was as a boy. Had he come back to gloat, perhaps to get a parade?

 It took Robert a little while to figure out, but he eventually realized why, his little brother needed a whooping.

Jean-Luc had convinced himself he just needed to go home to rest, but he could have done that anywhere and he even started making preliminary preparations to end his Starfleet career. Robert found Jean-Luc drunk in the kitchen, so he tore into his younger brother just like the bully he used to be. Then a punch in the face in a fight in the mud, Captain Picard burst out laughing and then broke down crying. 

Robert and Jean-Luc grown up together and they knew each other better than anyone else ever would. He knew how pretentious and stubborn his little brother could be, and he wasn't about to let him throw his entire career away just because he was scared. He knew new that the great Captain Picard just needed to let everything out and his big brother gave him exactly that.

Then the the two of them got drunk, and lied through their teeth as to where all the scrapes and bruises came from but Roberts wife came home.

23,DS9 Season 4 Episode 20 (The Muse) was incidentally all about drug addiction in creative writing and I totally missed it,1591038061,"I just wanted to take a second to praise the writing for this show. DS9 is quickly becoming my favorite series. The episode took on this subject matter while keeping the story consistent and fantastical without being (in my opinion) ham-fisted. In fact, I'm not even sure the drug reference was intentional, which just goes to show how universal the theme is.

As someone who's had friends that struggled with substance abuse I can't believe I totally missed this theme, but it seems clear to me now that Onaya was absolutely the personification of self-destructive creativity. After looking at it closer it seemed to me that one or more of the writers had personally witnessed the self-destructive cycle of substance abuse.
  
# Key points:

* **Onaya seduced Jake but there were no sexual tones whatsoever in their interaction.** The fact that she lures Jake and has obvious sexual presence shows that the is seductive but not sexual; she nixes the whole thought immediately on their first session. This represents the allure of drugs without any of the sexuality
* **Jake believes he needs her to write well.** In my personal interactions with friends struggling with abuse, many have expressed that they don't feel like they can operate on all 8 without their fix, whether it be amphetamines to elevate their creative potential or alcohol to make them funny and likable.
* **Jake ignores the nosebleed.** When a person becomes addicted they totally disregard the degradation of their body. Nosebleeds, open sores, coughing fits that should be alarming are barely taken notice of. Once Jake starts writing he cannot stop himself, even pushing himself to near death. A rather forward example of amphetamine abuse. He even looks spun when his father finds him.
* **Onaya forces him to rest.** I think this was a rather profound inclusion in the plot. As a parasite, she needed the host to maintain the most basic life functions so that she could continue to sap him. This is also true for substance abuse. When a user's life gets too out of hand to sustain the addiction they are forced -*by the drug-* to take a break or go to rehab so that they may get some balance and then actually continue to abuse the drug.
* **There is no justice for Jake.** Onaya takes what she wants from him and then disappears on to her next victim. It doesn't make much sense within the Star Trek universe but as the personification of a drug it makes a lot of sense. Those affected can never have retribution against a substance, it is an amorphous, elusive enemy that claims people and moves on to others.
* **Onaya names Keats as one of her successful protege's.** Keats was a prolific poet that died young. He was also addicted to opium, but this may not have been knowledge that existed at the time of this episode's production. The others named were meant to be alien names that resembled classic poets; thus, I believe the writers included Keats because Onaya was meant to represent a vampiric muse witch more than a drug, a supernatural cosmic entity that simply fed on creative minds churning out a life's work. It just happens to be that including Keats supports the drug personification theory, albeit unintentionally.

After looking into the episodes info and trivia on [Memory Alpha](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/The_Muse_(episode)) it seems that several production team members languished the episode, feeling that it failed to come together as a meaningful production, and truly I didn't feel much for it at all until I made the connection of drug abuse. After looking at all the details, I don't think that it was all that it could have been, but as it is it's interesting in itself as an example of a plot device that works on multiple levels and transcends the sci-fi genre to our lives in the mundane; Several accomplished writers have been known to have serious drug problems: Stephen King was a known cokehead; Faulkner was a boozer; Bukowski was an all-out degenerate; Poe must have been on something... right?  In all these examples, we have fantastic writers who were empowered by Onaya, who became what they did with her aid and at the sacrifice of their personal wellbeing.

29,A bit confused about Klingons,1591035764,"I’m a bit of a new Trekkie, I’ve just finished TNG and I’m currently on DS9 and I’m just a bit confused about something (maybe the answer is in one of the other series I haven’t watched yet) 

So in TNG Kahless gets cloned and looks like all the Klingons around him, but in DS9 when they go back in time and they’re on Kirks ship, the Klingons look a lot different and Worf says he doesn’t want to talk about. 

My problem is, if Klingons used to look different when Kahless clone pops up, wouldn’t the other Klingons be like “hang on, we didn’t used to look like that”? 

Can anybody tell me what’s going on? Is there some story in TOS I haven’t yet seen that explains this? Is it literally just because they didn’t have the means to make Klingons look different until the time of TNG? 

Also, when TNG first aired and the Klingons looked so much different, was this something that came as a surprise? Or did something happen in TOS to make them look different before TNG so fans knew it was coming?

31,Long Time Star Trek Fan Finally Watches DS9: season 3 episodes 3-10,1591035466,"I intentionally stopped short of the episode where they time travel because I feel like that’s going to be pretty intense.

I have some questions:
Are we ever going to find out what Garak did to get exiled? Because everyone we’ve met in the high command knows who he is. I don’t trust a word he says. But I want to believe he was and is a genuinely good person.

I just don’t remember the plot line where we got Riker 2.0 in next gen, but at the beginning of that episode here, Tom Riker gets angry at Miles and says that Miles knows why. I do not know why. Why was Riker unwilling to speak to Miles? 

Would it really bring down the trill system if the public found out that 50% of the population could be joined, but most of those joining would be bad and end in death? Dax’s joining to the composer technically worked, but... it was a disaster. The guy was a murderer. And he died six months later. As an initiant, I would rather live unjoined than lose more than half my life expectancy to spend six months in mental anguish. But that doctor lady seemed to think that this secret would tear down their society.

I have some thoughts:
I just realized Odo is in love with Kira, and my heart hurts. I want the world for Odo but Kira is so happy with the Vedec dude and I don’t want Odo to take that away to have her... ugh.

I am still in love with Odo’s development as a character. I’m aware of how much power he has now, and I love that he tried to use it to grant the Jem’Hadar kid independence, but I just don’t think he knows how it works yet. His regard for life and justice is still beautiful to me.

I WANT DAX AND JULIAN TO GET TOGETHER BUT NO. WE GOT JULIAN AND KIRA. But it was pretty funny when he told Sisko he needed help to get his own hands off Kira. Sisko was hysterically uncomfortable with the whole thing. It was one of the few times I’ve felt like Sisko was a good character for me. I am usually not one to go for off-cannon pairings but they just work together so well.

I LOVED the episode about the station shutting down when Miles tripped a security system leftover from Cardassian rule. That was amazing start to finish. We didn’t leave any characters out, and even though they couldn’t communicate, there was a way in which they knew “We should take these steps so they can take those ones.” Garak was funny. Gal Dukat was funny. This was a really clever and relatively simple way to play with all of the history they have built into the show. 

We also got some development on Dax. Some of it was good, like learning about the host that was hidden from her. That was interesting, clever, and I felt engaged. Then we had a cheesy love at first sight story. I wasn’t into that so much. I don’t have as much faith as Sisko did that she had thought it through.

Guys Miles doesn’t hate Julian anymore. But Julian is a poor wife replacement. And we saw some off-duty Kira, as enforced by Julian. I think the team dynamic is starting to make more sense.",startrek,MrPotato2753,False,/r/startrek/comments/guprk0/long_time_star_trek_fan_finally_watches_ds9/

The journey this episode manages to fit into a single episode is crazy.

The first act establishes Kurn as a tough no-nonsense Klingon commander who is pushing everyone on the Enterprise-D. Then in the second act they re-establish Kurn's character and make a complete tonal shift and you realize this episode is about something completely different – family, tradition, honor, intrigue, betrayal, etc. 

I can’t remember what my first thoughts were watching this episode as it’s been decades now but I can easily see how you would think that this was going to be a call back to “A Matter Of Honor” when Riker served as commander on a Klingon ship. 

What we ended up getting was the establishment of Worf’s primary arc in TNG/DS9 and in general the Klingon arc in TNG and somewhat DS9. The lore building in this single episode (***not a two-parter***) is unrivaled.

Even though this story initially was conceived by Drew Deighan and he gets writing credit what we see today is really the product of Ronald D. Moore and Michael Piller. They took the script(s) and expanded on it and help build the perception of Klingons.

For anyone who watches Outlander you can see RDM hasn’t lost his ability to make incredibly meaty episodes, it’s really a skill that not all good writers have in their repertoire. When I first started streaming Outlander I realized I couldn’t watch more than 2 or 3 episodes in a row like other shows because each one is so jam packed.

The First Federation had much more power than the Federation we all know and love.  The Enterprise was completely helpless against them resulting in Kirk having to bluff his way out.  In the end we seem to be on friendly relations. So why didn't we send someone to get them when the Borg showed up?  Or during the Dominion War, instead of assassinating Romulan senators why not try to get the First Federation involved?

Maybe our relationship with them is longer cozy.  Granted Kirk did send an incompetent officer over to be the ambassador, maybe Lt. Bailey really messed up.  I also have a suspicion that Bailey might have been a pedophile.  I mean who leaves a ship full of beautiful women in mini-skirts to hang out with a child-like alien on purpose?

80,The Aftermath of the Dominion War: a few questions,1590958093,"So right now, I'm contemplating running an online RPG session for Star Trek Adventures, and as DS9 was my favourite of the Treks, I'm thinking of setting my campaign a few months after the end of the Dominion War. Since I never read any of the Star Trek novels set in the post-Dominion War universe, there are a few things I am wondering on, for the sake of my campaign:

1. What happened to the Maquis? Were they more or less eradicated by the Dominion by the end of the war, or did they re-integrate back into the Federation? Or were there a few holdouts surviving after the end of the war?
2. I had read that the population of Betazed was brutally suppressed during the Dominion occupation, with many Betazoids being forcefully given inhibitors that suppressed their telepathy. Are there any other details about the Betazoid occupation, and its aftermath? In particular, how did this change Betazoid society?
3. I did read the novel ""A Stich In Time"" about Garak, and that at least details some of post-war Cardassia. That being said, generally, what did happen with Cardassia after the war? I imagine that, with a society that had been militarized for as long as theirs did, the transition back towards a civilian-led government was not easy nor peaceful.
4. Did the Breen abide by the treaty at the end of the war, or did they continue to follow their own ends afterwards?
5. I guess in general, what did the war do, permanently, to the Federation and its way of life? I imagine that, with so much of the Federation having been ravaged during the war, there would have been an ongoing humanitarian crisis for years, and I further imagine that Starfleet's attitude would have been more cautious in all of its future interactions with new species.
6. I'll be trying to keep cameo appearances by canon characters out of my campaign where possible. That being said, who was placed in command of DS9 after Benjamin Sisko's disappearance, and who took over security after Odo left for the Dominion? I imagine that, in general, there were a lot of vacancies on the station after the end of DS9 (although I also imagine that Quark's is still in operation)",startrek,GiveTheLemonsBack,False,/r/startrek/comments/gu6oh4/the_aftermath_of_the_dominion_war_a_few_questions/

You have average skill in your abilities. Everyone gets their choice of in the case of those unfamiliar with the show they get one that best fits their personality. We do not get the tech but you become fluent in your races language. So what would you choose and why. Also what do you think would happen to the world (this all happens at once in an ""act of god"" scenario) . I would choose Vulcan because A: enhanced lifespan undoubtedly extent B: enhanced intelligence undoubtedly useful C:the strength is nice D: we see via star trek enterprise (which I really like) that they do have intense emotion but they can mitigate it without becoming emotionless E: I can hide my race when the KKK 's numbers and activities increase tenfold and F:I could use mind melds to learn new languages and skills be placing the memories of learning them from someone else in my mind such that it is as natural to me as my first language and walking respectively. It was close between Vulcan Betazoid and Changling but Betazoids can't delve into a mind as deeply as a Vulcan and I think Changlings would be difficult to kill but electric shock probably could and they would likely be one of the most hated because they are inherently orderly most humans are not and we have what is different and we tend to fear what we can not be shore of and you can never be sure of what is or is not a Changling. As for the Pon Far I think it is that they only have the urge then, and what if you were to meld with your spouse during Pon Far and the use the now recorded mental state to induce it whenever you want. I don't think Vulcans would do this in the show because they don't like the lack of controle of your emotions that Pon Far brings. Sorry for how long this is.
