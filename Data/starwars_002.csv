36,my own little sequel trilogy,1600279521,"keep the force awakens exactly the same, great movie.

In episode 8, finn discovers his force powers and him and rey go to train under a willing luke skywalker on that planet i forgot how to spell(the one we find luke on) we discover kylo ren turned to the dark side because snoke had been doing to him what palps did to anakin, not because luke tried to kill him. Poe becomes second in command of the resistance and leia is incapacitated due to an attack again, just without the Mary poppins space stuff. the canto byte stuff remains the same except with Poe in finn's place.  everything to do with rose and finn is the same except poe replaces finn. poe beats captain phasma in a blaster shootout and they take a barely alive phasma prisoner after they manage to disable the hyperspace tracker. poe and rose escape the supremacy and the resistance retreats to the planet of hoth.

episode 9 opens with finn and rey on ilum, roughly 2 years after episode 8. they are constructing their lightsabers. rey has her yellow lightsaber while finn constructs a blue lightsaber that looks similar to anakin's but is still unique. Kylo Ren is searching for a holocron instead of the wayfinder in vader's castle on mustafar. he is visited by a light side force ghost of anakin who tells kylo ren to not go down the same path as he did. this sparks the first signs of conflict in kylo ren. he still takes the holocron and begins to meditate on it, however. finn and rey make it back to the resistance who have been on hoth for the duration of their training. leia is pleased to see them. she brings rey to a meditation chamber and has her meditate on her past through the force. rey learns that she is a descendant of the shan family, revan's bloodline. rey has no idea about her bloodline yet accepts it. meanwhile, finn and poe are laughing together as best friends talking about thing that happened while they were apart. poe and rose are now in a relationship yet havent tied the knot due to the first order's continuous reign. captain phasma is still prisoner but has not revealed anything about the first order. the resistance is still relatively weak but they've been speaking to other resistance sympathizers throughout the galaxy and have gained reinforcements for an all out attack on the first order. finn and rey decide to not get directly involved as they do not want to repeat the same mistake as the jedi of the clone wars era and let a war cloud their judgement. luke and chewie step off the millennium falcon and greet leia, who is shocked to see her brother after so long. together they begin to speak about all luke has missed. somewhere else in the galaxy kylo ren has been lurking over finn. finn has sensed his presence since he discovered his force sensitivity. rey and finn decide they will take on kylo ren alone, but instead of fighting him they want to turn him to the light. every so often kylo ren is visited by anakin skywalker who constantly tries to bring him to the light side. it's getting harder and harder for ren to resist. after some time, the resistance decides its time to strike. leia stays back as she has become too old and feeble. while the resistance is leaving hoth, the 4 jedi; finn, rey, luke, and leia all reach out to kylo ren. finn and rey go alone to meet kylo ren on malachor V. all across the galaxy, people are revolting against the first order. bit by bit the FO begins to crumble until, with their allies, the resistance takes out the supremacy with snoke on it. the first order is no more. finn and kylo ren have broken out into an all out lightsaber battle in the area where the mass shadow generator was activated thousands of years ago. kylo ren gets the upper hand and breaks past finn's force barrier. ren begins to crush finn's throat with the force. rey rushes in and force pushes ren. finn falls, gasping for air. rey defends finn who is in the midst of dying. kylo ren gets up and sees leia. behind him is luke skywalker and the ghost of anakin skywalker. he drops his lightsaber. leia reachers out with her hand and hugs her son. kylo ren is gone and ben solo has returned. he cries in his mothers arms. luke, being the powerful jedi he is, heals finn. with the first order gone and ben solo back, poe begins to build up a new republic. finn, rey, and ben start up a new jedi order. luke and leia die peacefully after many years training young jedi. the galaxy sees a new era of peace.

1. Palps returning. This made the ""chosen one / balance the force"" narrative in the first 6 meaningless, and on top of that they made him massively overpowered (force lightening against an entire fleet lol?) until they didn't and Rey destroyed him.

2. Lightspeeding through Starkiller base's shields. Apparently the new empire downgraded their shields after ROTJ, or they wasted half a movie on Endor blowing up a shield generator instead of just jumping behind the Death Star shields.

3. The collapse of Luke. In ROTJ Luke doesn't give in to hate or anger and forgives/redeems his Dad despite Vadar having done some pretty naughty things (poor poor younglings). But then his mixed up emo nephew has a couple of rough dreams and he considers chopping him in half. On Ahch-To he's pathetic. If you could have scripted exactly the opposite of how every Star Wars fan wanted to be reintroduced to Luke in the ST, they nailed it.

55,THEORY: Trace Martez is Ahsoka's padawan in Mandalorian season 2,1600274888,"Some have concluded that the hooded Jedi in the season 2 trailer is Sabine Ren, and while that is a fine theory, I'd argue that it would make a lot more sense that it is [Trace Martez](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Trace_Martez), the younger sister from the last Clone Wars season.  I know [a lot of people hate that character for whatever reason](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=trace+martez), but as a lifelong Latino SW fan, I can't tell you how satisfying it was to see characters that look/sound like my family in the series, so I was a big fan of hers from the jump.

1. Trace is an echo of Luke/Anakin/Rey: SW echoes it's own history, so it's likely intentional that Trace was written like the classic Jedi archetype.  She's introduced as a talented mechanic/mega-dork, and someone who sees themselves as an ace pilot in the making.  She comes from nothing, with a dark past involving the Jedi.  She goes on an adventure with, and is inspired by an actual Jedi, which gives her a perspective outside of the closed environment she comes from.
2. She showed inherent force abilities: Any time she is shown in physical danger, her instincts naturally aid her, including when she ignores her sister and Rafa while piloting her ship in Together Again, dangerously maneuvering to successfully defeat her attackers (reminiscent of Luke turning off the targeting computer).  On top of this, when Ahsoka explains that she left the Jedi council, her response of ""Why would anybody want to do that?"" gives the impression that she sees being a Jedi as a great honor.
3. Ahsoka's motorcycle line: The last thing Ahsoka says to the Martez sisters is that she's going to leave her bike with them ""...just in case.""  Given this is the last time we're supposed to see Trace, it seems extremely intentional that the writers would plant a seed for a future reunion between the characters.

An outcast Jedi needs a padawan to teach (that's just good Star Wars), and while theories like this are a credit a dozen, the story arc in those Martez Sister definitely plants a seed that the force is strong with Trace Martez.  Not to mention, seeing Rosario Dawnson and Sasha Banks  in full ""Qui-Gon and Obi Wan"" mode would be extremely cool.",StarWars,scrapedresin,False,/r/StarWars/comments/itzdar/theory_trace_martez_is_ahsokas_padawan_in/

61,The reason why Disney handled like the sequels like... how they did - and why it kind of makes sense,1600273140,"Now I'm not agreeing. I personally did not hate the Sequels, but I didn't like them becuase of how they tarnished the legacy and characters the original Trillogy. But it does make sense when you look at their big goal, it was just handled so VERY poorly.

It all makes perfect sense when you realise the biggest movie of 2019 was Endgame, obviously, owned by Disney. They want that success, and wanted to build a Star Wars Universe like the MCU from the ground up. Only difference is that all the characters from Star Wars were old now, and they had to make a new generation to kick start this with young people.

But they ran into a problem. To tell knew stories, they had to 'finish' the old one. This is where it gets messy.

They decided to make some kind of finale to the saga and give an ending to all the original characters, and fast. They had to overlook the development of the new characters to finalise the story of the original ones. But doing all this at once - ending and setting the seeds for starting 2 different sagas did not pay off well. They tried to od both which ended horribly because it was rushed and they didn't exactly know how to pull it off and please fans.

So we got the sequels which does all they wanted just with little success. Great. But in actual fact now they have what they want. No old character that people are complaining about not being there and a new generation to play around with and give proper stories.

That's why they don't care about the sequels being a flop. Their only concern is that they may never be forgiven for that they did, but that assume they will, because there Disney. I'm not saying I agree or even think what they did was tight, but I see what they wanted to do and technically pulled it off... Just about....

Noe they can build their new Star Wars Universe, hence them even having the audacity to call everything up to Rise of Skywalker The 'Skywalker Saga', saying that now it's over and all this stuff is new now. Hopefully we will get a lot new better Disney content, but until then...

79,Why was the Eclipse reduced to an Executor?,1600269260,"I mean. For those who don't know the eclipse in legends was a super star destroyer that was palpatines personal flagship and had an axial deathstar laser capable of cracking the crust of planets and destroying any ship in a single blast. 

In Aftermath: Life Debt in the new canon, they set up the eclipse as being palpatines flag ship and in the unknown regions. 

Eventually when we come across it in later works, it's reduced to an Executor. 

The eclipse could have been a spectacular new threat for the sequel trilogy, and before anyone says that it's too overpowered, the Final Order had planet destroying weapons on the dorsal side of ISD IIs.

It seems unlikely that palpatine, the man obsessed with super weapons, would chose to have such a normal flagship as just another executor. 

It baffles me that someone at lucasfilm actively chose to reduce it to an Executor, as it was set up on the hype train and then knocked down again. 

The Eclipse in episode 8 rather than the Supremacy (which turned out to be a huge disappointment anyway) would have been incredibly cool.

83,Question - what are the ST heroes fighting for?,1600268660,"This has been bugging for a while, and I'm hoping someone more familiar with the universe can help.

What are the plans of the Resistance in the ST for the future? I don't mean the immediate ""Blow Up the Bad Guys"" stuff, I'm talking their long term plans. 

In the OT, the Empire is established as a militaristic, racist and oppressive dictatorship. Opposing it are the egalitarian Rebels, who make some oblique references to a re-establishing a republican (presumably democratic) system of government. Not a lot of detail is provided, but the overall outline is clear - the Empire wants to keep on ruling and oppressing, the Rebels want to replace them with a more equitable system.

In the PT, we have characters openly, repeatedly, and in painful detail declaring their allegiance to either representative democracy (good!) or military dictatorship (bad!). While very clumsy, it is certainly clear who is fighting for what.

The ST shows that the New Republic established after the OT ended up being an ineffectual and corrupt mess that could not get its act together to confront the bad guys. The New Order is presented as an oppressive, militaristic dictatorship that wants to conquer the galaxy (bad!). Certainly evil, but at least their motivations and goals are more or less clear.

So what are the heroes fighting for? Is it to re-establish democracy in the form a New New Republic? Why would they do that, if the last time around went so poorly? What will they do differently this time around? What, if anything, have they learned from the collapse of the previous government?

I'm curious if this question is addressed in any of the expanded universe stuff, which I personally have not yet engaged with.

46,Luke's Final Stand (ANALYSIS),1600241640,"&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/42qxuu3ypgn51.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc9d68d750077f099ec97e271fc2a261bbe9a6b8

If this is not one of if not, the most Jedi thing in the history of Star Wars, I don't know what is. Luke's Final Stand is one of the most powerful and shocking moments in the entire saga. And it is time that I analysed this bad boy. Some of these ideas came from other people and I'll try and credit them (the ones I first saw, I know other people made the points too).

We start with the near destruction of the resistance. Hope is lost and the spark is out. No-one is coming to save the day. But then a mysterious hooded figure walks into the room and it is revealed to be Jedi Master Luke Skywalker. The first time Luke sees Leia, she is projecting herself and asking for help, the final time he sees her he is projecting himself and is answering the call to help (JM McNab on Twitter) -  [https://twitter.com/jmmcnabagain/status/984162881666248710](https://twitter.com/jmmcnabagain/status/984162881666248710) ) And I know what you are all thinking, Leia changed her hair and it looks nice that way (in fact is an Alderaanian mourning braid according to TLJ visual dictionary. She is currently mourning Han after all). It is time for forgiveness, Luke tells his sister that he is sorry but she knows he is and she's just glad he is with them at the end. Luke proceeds to tell Leia that he came to face Ben but he can't save him. Now, I have seen people think that Luke believes that Kylo Ren is irredeemable. Even Wookiepedia thinks this *""He also now believed that there was no hope for those who fell to the dark side, as shown when he openly expressed that he believed there was no hope for Kylo to return to the light."".*

NO! NO NO NO NO NO!

Luke DOES NOT believe Kylo Ren is irredeemable. He just says that HE can't save him.

*""And* ***I*** *can't save him.""*

There is no possibility of Luke being able to redeem Kylo. Kylo Ren HATES Luke for understandable reasons (from a certain point of view). There is no way he would listen to his uncle who ""tried"" to murder him. Darth Vader and Kylo Ren are two different people. To Vader, Luke represented a future of a loving family. To Kylo, Luke represents a murderer and the past that he hates so much. What worked for Vader can never work for Kylo. Even when Leia said that her son was gone he responds with ""No-one is every really gone"", he is talking about Kylo AND Han when he places the dice in Leia's hand. Combined with the dice and Leia's hair, it feels as if the trio are finally reunited metaphorically (Max Harrison (He also mentioned that the Han and Leia theme plays when Luke hands Leia the dice) - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHb9T6WvvW0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHb9T6WvvW0)). Someone really needs to ask someone to change that bit in Luke's Wookiepedia page because that is going to mislead a lot of people.

Anyway, moving on. As he hands Leia Han's dice, kisses her forehead and winks at C-3PO, he begins to confront the entire First Order. Everyone begins to rise and realize that this is the legend himself, Jedi Master Luke Skywalker. The heroic version of the Imperial March plays, carrying his father's legacy with him into battle (MrInsaneA - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHb9T6WvvW0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHb9T6WvvW0)) and as soon as he comes into view, Kylo orders his walkers to stop moving.

https://preview.redd.it/whbk3l70qgn51.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a86f40126fb7e007947b36f8d7eb866a73f0b65

Now, before I move on we need to talk about Luke's appearance in rapid fire questions:

Why does he look younger? Because he looked like that the last time he and Ben were together and this would anger his nephew. Also just want to note that his robes are having the dark color scheme with the white underneath, similar to his black outfit in ROTJ (can't remember where I got this point. I'll update it if I did). Take a look:

https://preview.redd.it/xtqd99u1qgn51.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97107cedef4d5b55204414c388430a5fb4fec767

https://preview.redd.it/grm8r0z2qgn51.png?width=391&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9de31759657afd1eed9181fba9de954d28acaf20

Why does he have his former lightsaber? Taking a look at a story perspective, Rey offered it to him twice and both times he rejected the call. Now he has finally accepted his legend status and is now back in the fight. As for in universe, Kylo is obsessed with that lightsaber. In TFA he said ""*That lightsaber, it belongs to me!""*. So Luke is pretty much teasing Ben that he has it and he doesn't.

&amp;#x200B;

How did Kylo not get suspicious that Luke had the saber since he saw it break? Firstly, as Rian Johnson said, Kylo only saw a bright light and was knocked unconscious. He doesn't know that it was destroyed. But lets just say that yes, he knew, it is kind of hard to see the hilt from the distance the two were away from each other and his rage blinded him so much that he didn't notice the most obvious thing, the saber (once again, can't remember where I got this from. I'll update it if I see it again.)

&amp;#x200B;

Pretty much all of this is to anger Kylo.

&amp;#x200B;

Kylo has just ordered the walkers to stop and, letting his emotions get the best of him, he ordered them all to fire on Luke. His uncle stands there and allows it to happen. But it isn't enough, it's never enough. *""MORE! MORE!""*. That's it, Luke Skywalker is dead.....but then he walks out completely uninjured and mocks their attempt with a shoulder brush (that was so cool in the film by the way), which angers Kylo so much that he orders them to bring him to his uncle and don't advance until he says. By the way before I go further, remember this quote from Vader?

https://preview.redd.it/8wud0sd4qgn51.png?width=410&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6950e4391e56dce1a3bd78e56280191b747f9840

It appears that the technological terrors (walkers) were insignificant next to the power of the force (projection). Now lets proceed.

Kylo walks up to Luke, both of them silent.

*""Did you come back to say you forgive me? To save my soul?""*

*""No.""* (He is only saying that to anger Kylo and begin their ""duel"", not because he thinks he is irredeemable.)

Now if you look at it from just the movie, it appears that Kylo is mocking Luke by asking him if he is going to redeem him like Vader. But when we take a look at the Snoke Resistance comic, things get interesting. In one part of the comic, as Kylo enters the dark side cave on Dagobah, the first thing he sees is his uncle who tells him that he doesn't want to fight, with him responding  that he doesn't care.

https://preview.redd.it/qyt59t66qgn51.png?width=659&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb5ac5d5c5a40ba815c37ebe63c1af270ca385f5

As one guy (Joe Kerr) said in a AT AT Chat video of this comic ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOcpyzhnPxs&amp;t=12s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOcpyzhnPxs&amp;t=12s)), Ben knows that deep down Luke would never have tried to kill him and that he already knows that Luke is sorry. He wants to be forgiven but Luke doesn't say that, and that is what angers him. Another guy (I can't find the comment) said that it is entirely possible that deep down he wants to believe that Luke tried to kill him because that would've meant that all he has done in the past 6 years would be justified (in his mind), but if Luke didn't try to, then it was all for nothing and he is in the wrong. I know this wasn't in the film but I had to mention it here.

The lightsaber ""duel"" begins around a area full of red, a visual metaphor of all the pain, anguish and death ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4RUTwPuMIk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4RUTwPuMIk)**)**.  Even in this ""duel"", Luke acts like a true Jedi as he not once attacks Kylo and proceeds to dodge all of his moves. *""A Jedi uses the force for knowledge and defense, never for attack""*. In one instance, Luke has tears in his eyes, saddened that his nephew hates him so much (noticed the tears and what they meant thanks to AT-AT Chat). He tells him that he is sorry only to be met with:

*""I'm sure you are! The Resistance is dead! The war is over, and when I kill you, I will have killed the last Jedi!""*

But he is completely wrong.  The rebellion is reborn, the war is just beginning, Kylo doesn't kill his uncle, and Luke will not be the last Jedi. Despite his claims that he would destroy her and all of it, Luke warns his nephew that if he strikes him down in his anger, he will always be with him, just like his father. If Kylo continues on this dark path on trying to destroy the past, he would only be causing himself more pain and more of the past will come back to haunt him (BattleUp Saber - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zmaHfyRO8Y&amp;t=133s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zmaHfyRO8Y&amp;t=133s)). But Ben doesn't listen. He charges, running, screaming, FINALLY he will have revenge and takes the swing and.........something is not right. That felt like nothing. Kylo turns around, Luke is still standing. And that is where it hits him. It's a force projection, he's been tricked, played like a fool and realizes that the Resistance has escaped. And he screams.

Meanwhile on Anch To, Luke is about to die. This was foreshadowed earlier on in the film by Kylo *""You're not doing this the effort would kill you""*. But then he notices the binary sunset, it ends where it began. If you look at the camera shots, Luke in ANH is facing the right, looking away to the future while in TLJ, Luke is facing the left, looking back on the past of his adventure and the friends he made and lost along the way (not my idea but I can't find the comment. I'll update it if I ever see it again). Take a look:

https://preview.redd.it/wypmqr78qgn51.png?width=1560&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a2d8509c3faef42ad42d32ae6ae1fe73feeab75

And finally, after he saved the resistance and ensured that the fight will continue and the heroes will win the day (which they did in TROS), and a voice telling him to ""Let go"" (this was in the TLJ novel, I think its Obi-Wan considering he told Luke to ""Let go"" during the Death Star trench battle), he becomes one with the force like his teachers and his father, peacefully and with purpose, looking towards the horizon one last time.

Luke Skywalker became the legend the galaxy desperately needed and that story on Crait was spread across the galaxy, lighting the spark that will light the fire that will burn the First Order down. Many people will hear how he played the First Order and its leader like fools without even attacking once (like a true Jedi), and disappeared with no injuries. He inspired many to join the resistance and fight back as well as freeing the galaxy from tyranny.

It was someone recounting their experience with Lucas in the early days of shooting. He mentioned that Lucas drew influence from a movie scene (maybe?) In which a adventurer tracked down and had a fight with a viking-esc character with a horned helm dark fur armor. I remember one of the characters having to cross a river and scale a small hill before the fightq. The scene used the exact same slow-mo effect as the Dagobah cave scene with Vader and was supposedly where Lucas got the inspiration for such an effect. 

If anyone can recall the name of the tv show, YouTube video or even the movie then I would greatly appreciate it.

The blade ignited, and Rey stood, full of strength freelygiven to her by those who had come before. The Emperor gasped. The avalanche of light from his fingertips ceased. He rose from his throne and stepped forward. His eyes glowed with lingering power. ‚ÄúLet your death be the final word in the story of rebellion.‚Äù Palpatine reached with his arms, sent Force lightning zagging toward her. She whipped up her lightsaber and blocked it. The impact nearly knocked her from her feet, but she reached for the Force, and stood her ground. His attack intensified. ‚ÄúYou are nothing!‚Äù he yelled. ‚ÄúA scavenger girl is no match for the power in me. I am all the Sith!‚Äù Her wrist felt like it was going to break. But it wouldn‚Äôt. Not today. ‚ÄúAnd I,‚Äù she said, reaching for more strength, for Leia‚Äôs lightsaber. It clicked into her hand. ‚ÄúI am all the Jedi.‚Äù She brought the second lightsaber to bear, crossing its blade with the first, creating an impenetrable shield. Rey stepped forward, pushing back against his onslaught. Then again. Every step was anguish. It was taking everything the Jedi had given her, everything she had. The lightning began to feed back on the Emperor. It ravaged his face, and he tossed back his head in agony, and in denial of what was happening. Rey pursued mercilessly, one foot in front of the other, absorbing power from the Force. Finally, she was ready. She gathered her strength, her faith in the Jedi past, her love of her friends, and she thrust it all at the Emperor. He staggered backward, his own power reflected against him. It devoured him completely, ripping away his newly healed fingers, searing away the skin of his face, his very bones, until he disintegrated. And like collapsing stardust, what remained of him coalesced into a single point, which then exploded with a massive shock wave that threw Rey to the ground. The Sith throne shattered. The ceiling bouldered down around her, crushing thousands of disciples in the amphitheater. """,StarWars,Mushroomtripper666,False,/r/StarWars/comments/itii87/mary_sues_dosent_need_help/

Mandalorian is set five years after ROTJ so it has been around 40yrs since the fall of the Great Republic? So a meek 40yrs ago thousands of Jedi were running all over the place but everybody already forgot about that?

I mean you could probably assume that the Empire ran a pretty tight propaganda operation in order to eradicate the memory of the Jedi, but reducing them to ""weird legend""-status within 40yrs seems far-fetched. There must be plenty of people still alive who met a Jedi!

It never made sense in the old trilogy either but you could just kind of ignore it, instead of stressing it. So a guy like The Mandalorian, who's been all over the galaxy and has dealt with everything and everyone has never heard of the Jedi? Come on.

My goal with the rewrite was to try and give the characters more coherent arcs, add bits of lore that I personally enjoy, and generally make the world the ST exists in feel rounded out and connected, like there's an actual galaxy outside the Resistance v. First Order conflict. Whether I succeeded or not is for readers to decide.

I have Episodes 8 and 9 outlined so I know where the story is going ahead of time.

A few things that are immediately different:

1. Rey and Finn start off knowing they're force sensitive. Rey has been trained by a caretaker character on Jakku.
2. There's still a mystery regarding where she came from but it will be definitively answered by the end of the episode and used as a springboard for EP 8.
3. Palpatine is and remains dead. He will be referenced, but he's still dead.
4. The First Order is fleshed out in a manner somewhat similar to the Empire of the Hand, with the addition of a creepy space religion.
5. Ilum is a Sith academy world, not Another Death Star But Bigger‚Ñ¢.
6. The Knights of Ren are trained Sith and have roles in the story.

There's more, but if these differences sound interesting to you then feel free to give the fic a read, it'll be updated every tuesday.

28,Some Takeaways on The Mandalorian Trailer.,1600195180,"**THIS IS THE WAY!**

Finally, it's here. After months of waiting and rumors abound of when it will drop, we have finally been graced with the first trailer.

Here are a couple of things that I noticed that are more of just observation based than pure speculation.

Okay, so we open up on what looks like a damaged Razor Crest limping towards a moon. My assumption is that this could be one of two locations; Yavin IV or Endor. I'm more inclined to say that it is more than likely Yavin for multiple reasons:

1. The remains of the Great Tree on Coruscant were reseeded on Yavin by Poe's parents at the behest of Luke. It would be only natural that The Child would be attracted to something with such a strong connection to the Force that once resided in the heart of the Jedi Temple.
2. We saw the Death Star wreckage in TROS, I highly doubt Lucasfilm would bring that back. Been there, done that.

We then transition to what *seems* to be a desert planet of some kind. I only say this because of the horizon and coloring of the sky at dusk--it's very indicative of a desert-like location. The following scene could be apart of that same sequence but I don't recognize the architecture.

I doubt that planet is Tatooine, but I know that the next scene with the Tusken Raider and Bantha are definitely Tatooine, possibly near the area where Luke was saved by Obi-Wan? Who knows, I digress.

The next scene was/is a little tricky. On one-hand, it could be Ilum before or in the very early stages of construction of Starkiller Base. On the other, it could be Hoth. I'm leaning towards Ilum as it's a location that has never been explored. Sure, we saw it as Starkiller Base but not Ilum in its purity. The only reason why I say Hoth is that in the following clip, we see The Child and Din standing in front of a downed Y-Wing(?). This is a rough assumption but the turrets on the nose as well as its general shape and paint have striking similarities.

Following this, we see a port filled to the **BRIM** with Quarren and a handful of off-worlders. Yup, you can probably guess where I'm going with this--that planet has to be Mon Cala. More evidence of this can be shown with the skiff in the next scene as well as some background information connecting the First Order invasion on the planet in *Spark of Resistance.*

The rest of the trailer does not really give me anything eye-popping except the fighting ring. I assume that this could be in the same location where the graffiti'ed buildings are as it has a similar ""vibe"" so to speak. Mind you this is all conjecture.

If anyone has seen something that I may have missed or a point of interest, please, let me know! I'd love to hear everyone's thoughts!

41,"No, Darth Vader's character wasn't betrayed nor ruined. (DARK HEART OF THE SITH SPOILERS)",1600192277,"So a preview of the latest Darth Vader: Dark Heart of the Sith comic came out a few days ago which involved Darth Vader ""destroying"" Padme's tomb. I was a little surprised that some people thought this was out of character for Vader. In my opinion, it perfectly lines with what we know of our favorite Sith Lord and I'll explain why. 

Firstly lets just say that Vader never destroyed the tomb. He was going to but he stopped himself after seeing a memory of Padme. Some might be annoyed at the fact that Vader would even do it in the first place. But remember, at this point in his life, Darth Vader views Anakin Skywalker and his life as a Jedi as completely separate from him . He wants to kill every last reminder of the man he once was and it doesn't surprise me that he would do something like this. Hell, not only did this guy betray his ""family"" and kill innocent children, but he force choked his wife not once, but TWICE. The first time was on Mustafar and while yes he thought she betrayed him and was angry, he still did it nonetheless with that moment trying to signify that Anakin is long gone. Sure, he loves his wife and wants to save her, but it is clear from that response alone that his love for her is extremely possessive and not healthy. The second time was in the 2015 Darth Vader comic where he force chokes his wife (it could be a a memory of the the first event instead of him actually choking her but I don't know) saying that Anakin Skywalker was dead and he ""killed"" him. So really, it doesn't surprise me that he would attempt to destroy Padme's tomb. If anything, it adds to the tragedy of Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader.

https://preview.redd.it/srj98ulincn51.png?width=654&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66be017f9556e3c9034f8d0fc4d5c810fb38c41e

HOWEVER, this is Darth Vader after ESB and his encounter with Luke. Him stopping himself from destroying the tomb shows that his conflict is growing stronger and Anakin Skywalker is slowly returning, despite not wanting to admit that. This conflict started because of Luke's existence. That moment wasn't a betrayal of Anakin. On the contrary, it is showing the beginning of the end of Darth Vader, and the return of Anakin Skywalker, the return of the Jedi, as well as showing just how important Luke is as he is the last reminder (besides Leia but he doesn't know about her being related to him yet) of Padme and a representation of a potential future with a loving family, and that is the only thing that can redeem his father. And that is why I think the moment in the comic doesn't betray the character of Anakin Skywalker.",StarWars,DisturbedSnowman,False,/r/StarWars/comments/itdtb9/no_darth_vaders_character_wasnt_betrayed_nor/

So we finally watched the last Jedi and rise of Skywalker,we also saw rogue one and solo, here's his thoughts:

The last Jedi: he actually really really liked it,he especially loved the battle at the throne room and told me kylo ren was one of the best characters in the series. He later told me this and return of the Jedi were his favorites!

Rise of Skywalker: He, pretty controversially of course,liked it,he is pretty neutral about the revival of Palpatine and joked about it that Palpatine got marvelized(an obvious reference to the fact characters keep coming back in marvel movies). He was shocked at the end when Rey goes back to the place Luke used to live in and Barried leia's and Luke's sabers.

Rogue one: He first didn't wanna watch it because it isn't really that important but when he did watch it he really liked it,he was pretty surprised Palpatine didn't at least make a cameo but he didn't mind it,he also was surprised to see they CGIed peter cushing back to life. He also loved the final scene with Vader slashing the rebels.

Solo: He liked it A LOT more than I thought he would. Since han solo is his favorite character after all it makes since. He liked how it was basically a space Western since he grew up with westerns after all. He was a bit confused about how maul came back but I explained it to him.

73,Unpopular Opinion: Sequels are even better than Originals,1600187716,"Yeah I said it. I feel that they take what's great about the originals (directing, practical effects, tone etc), everything great about the prequels (more complex story), and combines the two with quality acting. 

I love the direction, I love all 3, and there's nothing that doesn't make sense in the movie. I feel that all the information for one's questions is present without spelling it out verbatim, which my buddy studying creative writing tells me is a hallmark of good writing. Hell, sometimes it IS borderline spelt out, like with Holdo. I feel that if some of these detractors were to just watch the movies whilst TRUSTING that the writers, directors and producers care enough about the franchise to make movies that made sense, everything would change,

I don't even hate the prequels. I think they had an amazing story with not amazing directing and acting. 1 and 2 are my least favourite, but there are still nice things to take from them, and I still have fond memories of them! I was aged 4-9 while they were coming out.

Who cares if I'm downvoted as hell? What's an arrow on a website to living a fulfilling life?  I sometimes feel like it's like some of these fans WANT to hate the movies. So resistant to other, more positive outlooks, which one would think is something they'd like.

83,"After putting off on watching Episode 9 again after a mental struggle with the movie and a bit of laziness, I finally got to rewatching the final arc of the film for kicks last night, and it was the most beautiful and fun experience I've had with Star Wars again in a while.",1600186556,"I know that this is ""sacrilege"" or even a ""death sentence"" to say anywhere related to Star Wars, movies, or just about any geek-centric fandom, but I decided to rewatch the final arc of The Rise of Skywalker after putting off revisiting it for a while, and it was genuinely the best experience I've had with Star Wars in a long time.

(There are a lot of items that came up last night so this is gonna be a somewhat lengthy stream of thoughts from my viewing.)

Episode 9 was sort of an oddball movie for me because it felt weird trying to process all of the different parts of the film after seeing it whiz by like that in the theaters. That alongside the fandom on all sides being very angry and fighting left and right over it just made me felt sick trying to think right about the movie. I was torn over the parts that I liked/didn't like as much, over trying to find a stable stance on the movie and resisting to jump to one side of the fights over the movie being good or bad, and not wanting to feel terrible over liking certain items or getting overtly worked up about some stuff that felt off initially in my first viewing. This inevitably led me to stop my engagement with the fandom for a while so I could get away from the forum wars and keep my head fresh, and led me to disengage with Star Wars for a while just so I could take a break from it all and focus in on other hobbies or games.

Slowly after some time of clearing my mind on Star Wars, I started to get engaged in the franchise again. I got back in the groove of checking out a few classic and newer Star Wars games. I finished up the last season of The Clone Wars, and I've jumped back into checking out old clips of my favorite moments from the series. Still, I had not been able to get back into rewatching Episode 9 right away, partially due to still feeling off about the film, partially due to laziness, and partially due to getting busy trying to catch up on a lot of other movies and games I was behind on. But now, after getting some time to think out some parts of the film, and after feeling now was the right time to squeeze in a bit of Star Wars movie viewing while in quarantine, I went ahead and watched the final arc of The Rise of Skywalker, and it was the most fun I had with Star Wars in a long time.

Rewatching the whole experience, from the return to Exogol to the final return to Tatooine, I felt like a kid again. It gave the same chills and vibes when I rewatched Revenge of the Sith, Rogue One, and the first few sequel films many times before and in the days prior to Episode 9's theatrical release. The battle over Exogol was a thrilling visual experience with the grand battle between the Emperor's fleet and the largest resistance fleet of both fighters and ordinary people that we have seen with Star Wars on film. I felt chills again when I saw Lando lead all of the fighters out of the nebula with the Falcon. Palpatine felt menacing in about the same way he did for me when I saw him in Episode 3, and his battle with Kylo and Rey was pretty cool too (with the Force Drain technique reminscent of stuff you'd see in KOTOR [at least from what I've seen in many lore videos] and his final demise at the hands of his own Force Lightning [lol almost like he can't give up his signature move despite him frying his face with Windu on Coruscant]). And Ben Solo's final moments, with his gesturing just like Han and his last smile before becoming one with the Force, all felt great to watch again. The Resistance's celebration on Ajan Kloss was very beautiful and heartfelt to watch again; the musical score paired up with seeing Rey, Poe, and Finn reunite after the final battle really tugged at my heartstrings. And the finale on Tatooine with the return to the Lars Homestead and Rey and BB-8 staring off into the sunset were a nice final touch.

Overall, it was a fun, exciting, and beautiful experience getting back into rewatching Episode 9 again through the final arc. There are a few things that still felt a bit off. The Knights of Ren and the Sith Troopers could have had a bit more ""oomph"" in terms of battle scenes to show how menacing they could be (particularly the Sith Troopers considering how powerful they can be displayed within the new Battlefront 2). A few items could have used a bit more clarity, particularly how Palpatine planned to transfer himself into Rey by having him kill her for a ritual, and Finn's special secret he meant to tell Rey (After seeing a few videos and looking at the last scenes, I think he was alluding to being slightly Force-sensitive, especially when we see him worry about Rey after she collapses after defeating Palpatine, but it could have been reinforced more with a few examples of him using the Force to make it more apparent). And the concept of Rey as a ""Palpatine"" or ""Skywalker"" still feels slightly off when it rolls off the tongue, although I am still processing it and thinking more on it, and it doesn't bother me as much as it did before. And I do need to put aside some time for myself to sit down and rewatch the full movie again to engage in it again. But nonetheless, jumping back into The Rise of Skywalker's final arc was overall one of the most fun experiences I've had with Star Wars recently, and I'm looking forward to jumping back into this film and potentially exploring other upcoming SW content in the many months to come.",StarWars,MarthsBars,False,/r/StarWars/comments/itbyuu/after_putting_off_on_watching_episode_9_again/

36,"Can we talk about Star Wars, Squadrons?",1600180846,"Let me begin with this: If you're excited for the game, great! I'm not trying to rain on anyone else's parade. 

I'm just feeling kind of down as someone who loved the old X-Wing and Tie Fighter games from the 90s... (and who still plays them, you can get them from GOG and they're fun with a flight stick even today.)

This 5 vs 5 balanced PVP game is... not what I was hoping for in a star wars space combat game, and with the new trailer and the lack of B-wings in the era I'm feeling a bit down.

The game appears (and please let me be wrong about this) to be completely ignoring the way space combat works in Star Wars. 

I've always loved that there's a different kind of balance in the star wars universe for Starfighers.

Imperial fighters tend to be more maneuverable, and there's some suggestions of faster-firing lasers so potentially with greater firepower and a higher recycle rate on their shots. But they don't have shields or hyperdrives (until the Tie Advanced and Tie Defender came into use). This meant that Imperial doctrine relied on numerical superiority, but even in a one-on-one engagement a skilled pilot can win a fight.

And from a pure fun standpoint, that's one of the things I loved about flying imperial craft against rebel craft in X-wing vs. Tie Fighter. If you defeat an X-wing in a Tie Fighter, or an A-Wing in a Tie Interceptor, it means you out-flew the other pilot, chipped away at their shields, and didn't make the mistakes that would have seen them turn you into a cloud of rapidly expanding superheated gas. 

Rebel starfighter doctrine was completely different. Their craft were less maneuverable (so a victory still meant you had to work for it because if you let an Imperial sit on your tail your shields only last so long) but it also meant relying on teamwork. Their strengths were their tankiness and their ability to carry secondary weapons like torpedoes and concussion missiles. And as much as I hated being knocked out of the sky by concussion missiles I failed to dodge it was a reality you had to deal with as an imperial pilot.

It also means that rebel craft could double-up their shields and ram you if you tried to play chicken with them. Also, don't play chicken with an X-wing they'll link their lasers, wait til the last moment and light you the hell up.

And the way that combat happened centered around this. The Imperials had beastly logistics, but the Rebel tactics targeted that. You can't keep your numerically superior fighters maintained if your spare parts keep getting blown up by rebel fighters hyperspacing in and blowing up your supply depots. As a rebel, the moment you feel numerically overwhelmed you can make a jump to hyperspace and get the hell out of there. You needed to kill Y-wings before they hit the ship you launched from because if they blow up that star destroyer... it's a long walk home from deep space without a hyperdrive and you're not going to make it. The death of your star destroyer means that if rescue doesn't get there in time, you're dead too.

But all this means that if you don't feel outmatched in some way fighting even one-on-one with OpFor regardless of whether you were rebellion or imperial ... the game isn't properly balanced.

I'm really worried about the way PVP players demand that the playing fields be leveled flat. I've experienced that in even relatively non-toxic PVP environments like MechWarrior Online. I'm worried that the game will ignore the canon and everything we know from canon discussions about star wars fighter craft.

Now maybe they've taken all that into account, and that's why they're not including, say, the B-Wing, which exists in the time period the game is set in as the premier Republican heavy fighter.

The other thing is... there's a star wars fighter game I've been wanting since I was a snot-nosed ten year old first getting my hands on a joystick and playing X-wing.

I want a game where you start as some green pilot at the imperial naval academy. Over the course of the story you have several opportunities to defect to the rebellion. You see the Empire for what it is, and you either decide to be loyal to the Empire or fight for the Alliance to restore the Republic. The choice should feel significant. It means leaving your friends behind and potentially facing them in combat. 

You get these options once just after flight training, once mid-way through the campaign, and a final option a few missions before the endgame. There should be newgame+ options that let you play both campaigns all the way through, and multiplayer set in the various game eras as tech becomes available throughout the story.

I've been wanting that game for years.

I'm not posting this to be a doomer. I want to feel like I'm not getting milked for cash here fam. Can anyone set my mind at ease and help me feel a little bit of excitement for the new content?

It's okay that it's not the game I wanted. I just want it to feel like Star Wars, rather than a generic space combat game in a star wars costume. 

And due to the inherently unbalanced nature of starfighter combat in the canon, I'm really not sure a 5v5 multiplayer game was... the best route for the core material.",StarWars,OllieGarkey,False,/r/StarWars/comments/ita2ry/can_we_talk_about_star_wars_squadrons/

57,(Disney+Kenobi theory) Darth Vader hunts a guilt-ridden Obi-wan during the events of the Jedi purge after Order 66. Flashbacks from Obi-wan's past show a new perspectives of the prequels,1600138788,"TL;DR:¬† The show will be the ultimate bridge between the prequels and Original trilogy, featuring flashbacks to the Clone Wars, conversations between Qui Gon, Obi-wan, and Yoda about Anakin. It will show us the perspectives of characters we didn‚Äôt see in the films and the thoughts and actions of these characters behind the scenes of the events we already know. The series will also give us our first real glimpse into Anakin as Darth Vader, his grief at the loss of Padme, and his relationship with Palpatine.


Speculation:

I believe that the D+ Obi-wan Kenobi series will feature an intriguing structure. We know that there are rumours that the series will feature a clone era Anakin Skywalker, and reports are leaking that Darth Vader will also make his way into the show. So just how will all of this work. Well, I have an idea.

Firstly the structure, I think we see Obi-wan on the desert planet Tatooine going about the soul-destroying drudgery of surviving while hiding. He ekes out a miserable life on Tatooine while the emperor and his newly-suited apprentice; Darth Vader, subjugate the galaxy.

Secondly, each episode will feature a flashback to the clone wars as Obi-Wan attempts to deal with the guilt of creating the galaxy‚Äôs most vicious mass murderer. The flashbacks will show new perspectives on events we have already seen in the prequels or Clone Wars series. This would be a great opportunity to see the scenes between scenes. The parts of the story left out of the films. Scenes between Obi-Wan and the council regarding Anakin and their fears. Scenes with Qui-Gon about why it is so important to train Anakin. Scenes where we see the little moments where Anakin is starting to doubt the Jedi. It will be in these flashbacks that we see Obi-Wan‚Äôs past and the reasons he wishes to redeem himself with Luke. This would be an excellent way to expand and humanize Anakin‚Äôs character while showing how Obi-Wan changes from the Clone War general from the prequels into the original trilogy‚Äôs old Ben.

Thirdly we will see Vader‚Äôs true power, much like in the final moments of Rogue One. He will be hunting and destroying the last remaining Jedi, almost like a short horror segment attached to the end of each episode. Vader has one singular goal, to find and kill Obi-wan. The insights we gain in each Flashback will make this part all the more devastating, as we start to connect deeper with Obi wan and Anakin and .¬† It would be wise to keep this part small, maybe thirty seconds each episode, a small glimpse of Vader‚Äôs rage juxtaposed by the guilt of Obi-Wan coupled with flashbacks of young Anakin.¬† If done right, this show can be a tentpole in the Star Wars mythology.¬†

After the sequels, my trust has not been strong in Disney's Star Wars, but I still think that with the right ‚Äò‚Äôwriters, directors, and focus on character-driven stories, Star Wars can once again gain my trust.

14,Sequel Movie Idea. Thoughts?,1600118754,"So me and my brother are big star wars fans. And we were discussing the sequels (he was ranting more than talking) and we, like 99% of people with eyes and a brain have problems with the sequels. So we brained a sequel trilogy, and what are y'alls thoughts? Keep in mind this is just an idea and has 0 frame work beyond that.

First, let's talk about the sequel. I don't even think we needed sequels because as our lord George Lucas said in an interview, ""Star Wars is about the Tragedy of Anakin."" Disney could have stuck with new stories/content like what they did with The Mandalorian and Rogue One. But the money-grubbing machine had to pump out movies. Another issue was no conflict, an example is Rey instantly becoming a master of everything she did, such as beating Kylo the first time she held a lightsaber. You can chalk some things up to ""she has hella midi-chlorians"" but at some point it's lazy writing. 

Now on to our idea.

1rst movie: It's like 10 years after the empire fell. The New Republic is building a democracy on Coruscant with Leia, Han, Chewie living there. Luke has sought out force sensitives and is training them at the Jedi Temple on Yavin 4 (the rebel base in Episode 4). The remnants of the Empire, such as the training station on Carida, are still milling about, with the New Republic going in and flushing them out. While Luke is training his new recruits when they stumble upon a sith temple with the ghost of Exar Kun, an ancient Sith Lord. He manipulates a padawan to go to the dark side, and he becomes quite powerful Through Kun's help he fights Luke and kills him with ancient sith techniques he's never seen, and he goes to unite the remnants of the empire. Similar to when Maul took Mandalore in Clone Wars by killing Pre Vizla. They unite the scattered empire and go to attack Coruscant. The empire runs over the New Republic, and the New Republic request help from the Padawans and Luke. As they arrive they find the empire has taken over. Leia and Han are MIA.

2nd Movie: The Padawan's are searching Coruscant looking for Leia and Han while fighting off the empire. They run into Lando and Chewie among this. Chewie and Han got separated in the chaos and they have to break the news Luke is dead. They decide to see if Admiral Ackbar returned to his home at Mon Calimari, and took Leia and Han with them. The leader of the Padawans tells them to go with Lando and Chewie, he's gonna look for the Pawadan turned dark side with one other willing to fight. The group finds them, Leia and Han, in the republic shipyards planning a counterattack to retake Courscant. While they plan the counterattack the empire comes to Mon Calimari to finish off the New Republic Leader, but Admiral Ackbar pulls some large brain defenses and fends them off. Tne crashed Star Destroyer supply them for the counter-attack. While this is happening The leader Padawan and his ally find the fallen padawan and before they attack, Luke's ghost appears, telling them their not strong enough to defeat him. They believe otherwise and go in. The Fallen Padawan is much more powerful than before, revealing Exar Kun (sith from the first movie) is injecting him with force steroids basically. He kills the leader's friend and toys with the leader because he is so much more powerful. He is then beaten, and imprisoned because the Fallen Padawan plans to turn him to the dark side. It ends as the Mon Calimari ships, armed with imperial gear arrive to retake coruscant.

3rd Movie: It opens on the attack on Courscant, Leia, Han, Chewie, Lando, and the padawans leading the attack. During this, the Fallen Padawan is torturing the leader, attempting to turn him. Leia and Han are taking care if the trooper v trooper aspect, and they let the padawans look for the Fallen Padawan. Due to their battle inexperience, they start to get overtaken and the Fallen Padawan brings himself, and the tortured leader to the ground. Before they engage the Fallen Padawan Luke told them he'd find and fight the Ghost Sith, Exar Kun, that manipulated the Fallen Padawan and kill him. He finds Exar Kun and begins to fight, using force powers to fight. While the Padawans fight, the Fallen begins to kill and run over the padawans while the leader is watching, and seeing this Leia's, Han's, Chewies, and Lando's forces begin to get pushed back. But finally Luke manages to Kill Exar Kun. And without him, the boost the Fallen got is no more. But once he loses his power and returns to before he got juiced up, he's killed or incapacitated the entire padawan force except for the leader. seeing the power leave him the Leader gets up, grabs a dead padawan's lightsaber, and fights the fallen one. After a very close fight, the leader defeats him, and the attack on Courscant is successful.

2. Pre- OT Empire Technology being used i.e. the walkers not being designed like the OT walkers or the star destroyers
3. The use of Clone Wars characters and planets.

Really what it comes down to is: how is the prequel era defined? Is it any and all events that take place before A New Hope? Is it when the empire starts using the technology that's in the OT movies? Or does the prequel era end after Revenge of the Sith? What do you guys think? Let me know below!

So my question is, is dropping your Jedi robe just a factored in cost to the Jedi temple. That they are just one-time uses, and it is just known they will be discarded after a fight? Or do you think they go back retrieve them ever?

2. Do the Inhibitor Chips only force the Clones to complete Order 66 or are all 150 Emergency Orders included?

3. Did Jedi/Sith gave their Lightsaber a name, like most fantasy sword usually?

5,How Powerful Would Palpatine's Offspring Be?,1600044432,"Since the Palpatine bloodline is perhaps only second to the Skywalker bloodline, I was wondering how powerful the Emperor's potential child would be. This will be just for entertainment purposes, so, how about this?

Let's say Palpatine created a child with a Skywalker. Yes, it'd be the most cursed bloodline you'd ever see. Who would be the Skywalker? Let's just pick Leia. If we go by Lucas' words that Luke had the same potential as Anakin (which I don't really agree with), Leia should be the same, somewhat.

So, you'd have an already insanely powerful Palpatine now with a Chosen One Skywalker? That would be god-like, in my mind. If you agree that two force users would probably make a stronger force-user.

I won't get into why the hell Leia would consent, and to be honest, she wouldn't. She would have to be captured and tortured, etc. That isn't the topic of this discussion. I'm just focusing on what would this Palpatine would be.

In my mind, he (or she, I'll just refer to he) would be double the power of the Chosen One. It'd only make sense (if you believe that won't happen, then at least comparable). If you already have a mini-chosen one (Leia) mixed with an insanely powerful force-user, it is only logical that the child would be even more powerful (assuming, for some reason, that doesn't happen, then at least the second most powerful.)

What would the new Palpatine be like? I'd imagine he'd have the same psychopathic insanity as his father (unless some Skywalker genes kick in). With both the Skywalker and Palpatine's force powers mixed in, Force Lightning would be the most devastating power EVER.

The child would go to become a hardened warrior in the equivalency of Anakin Skywalker. Or you can say Sheev Palpatine would just possess the child and become even more powerful. Since Palps doesn't care. (That's what he wanted in DE.)

I'm just saying, basically, he would probably be the Chosen One 2.0. I don't mean by taking down the Father (and those other characters), but I mean in raw force potential. It'd make a good story.

I don't buy the fact that the new Palpatine wouldn't be as powerful even with two amazing blood-lines. I can't buy that. In my mind, he'd be double the power, but that's just what I think with my knowledge of Star Wars. I'm not getting into arrogance or overconfidence (which very well could happen, like with Anakin), so who knows.

Though, enough of my speculation, the question is: what do you think this Palpatine would be like in power levels? I think it is an interesting enough question to ask on here.",StarWars,WraithfulWrath,False,/r/StarWars/comments/isak7l/how_powerful_would_palpatines_offspring_be/

So naturally, now, I'm interested to see the relationship between Obi Wan and Anakin before episode 2. At the end of episode 1 and in media like Master and Apprentice, it alludes to the fact that Obi Wan dislikes Anakin and wishes Qui Gon hadn't put the task of training him on him. So seeing how it jumps to episode 2 where they're all buddy buddy now leaves a lot to be lusted for. Are there any good books about Obi Wan training anakin? Perhaps an audio drama? Anything.

14,What is the biggest gripe or pet peeve you have with Star Wars as a franchise? (ALL TRILOGIES INCLUDED!),1600036792,"Now, I love Star Wars! Obviously, I wouldn't be here if I didn't. That said, I do have some pretty nagging issues with this franchise. And not just the sequels... but the originals... and the prequels too!

And with that joke out of the way, **my** biggest issue with SW as a franchise is that it constantly retcons and condradicts itself. It really annoys me how inconsistent this franchise is when you really look at it. 

Even the all powerful OT has weird little retcons and inconsistencies throughout the trilogy, and that's even if you ignore the other two trilogies. The OT has straight up INCEST because GL decided to make Luke and Leia siblings in between movies. Also, the 'Darth' in Darth Vader was clearly originally supposed to be his first name (""only a master of evil, Darth!""). 

The prequels add more little inconsistencies and not just narrative ones. Even aesthetically, the prequels don't look like they fit in with the gritty, lived-in aesthetic of the OT and ST. The prequels also shoe-horn in this whole Chosen One prophecy which *retroactively* makes the entire saga (up to that point, anyway) about Anakin. 

Then the sequels come along and add even MORE little (and large) inconsistencies and retcons. It retcons the Chosen One (which I personally never cared for in the first place but a lot of others seem to). It retcons Rey's parentage... twice! It practically resets the Galactic Civil War. It continues the story of the original trilogy... by... retelling the story of the original trilogy. 

To reiterate, I love this franchise and I enjoy all three trilogies for what they are, but that is my biggest gripe with Star Wars as a whole. It lacks consistency.

To capture a command post, you have to stand near it and make sure no enemy players are near it as well, like in the Battlefront games. If you die, you won‚Äôt be able to use your blaster and you have to go back to a command post you control and wait three seconds.

To win, you have to capture all the command posts and keep them for approx. 20 seconds. The command posts will play a little victory jingle to signal to all the players.

After shutting down the factory Anakin decided to destroy the mine the Seperatists had gotten the cortosis from.

Against Thrawn and Padme's warnings he blew up the mine. However he didn't account for the Cortosis's ability to reflect energy. This turned what Anakin expected to be a small explosion into basically a Nuke.

But I still do think it could be interesting to see what the Skywalkers were like when Shmi was young or something.

Darth Vader - Vader's first task given to him by Sidious was to invade the Jedi Temple in episode III, hence the name Vader.

Darth Tyranus - Count Dooku's first task given to him by Sidious could have been subgate a star system through tyranny and could be related to the formation of the confederacy of planets.

Darth Maul - Sidious first task to Maul was maybe to maul some one, I guess.

Darth Sidious - Darth Plagueis' first task to Sidious was maybe to cause harm in some subtle, gradual way.  This could be related to his initial career in politics and how he initial got ahead in his career.

33,Why I think the 2003 Clone Wars is way better than the 2008 show,1599947647,"I know a lot of you guys prefer the 2008 TCW show but I really don‚Äôt like it. 

First of all, I think Anakin is portrayed way better in 2003, he feels more like Hayden Anakin and that‚Äôs a pro imo. In the 2008 he is a very simple guy that‚Äôs just a simple hero guy, he doesn‚Äôt feel like Anakin at all. He seems to enjoy his time with the Jedi and don‚Äôt really gets angry or conflicted a lot. Him having a padawan is also very weird and doesn‚Äôt fit his character.

Second, I think the CIS is portayed way better and not like a bunch of stupid robots that only shoot when they feel like to, Grievous is also portayed like an idiot in the 2008, even though he should be a very strong cyborg warrior that actually fights and doesn‚Äôt just chill on a command deck all the time. Dooku is also better in the 2003 version, in the 2008 version he is just pure evil and also talks like it. The 2003 show has the Dooku feel just more I guess.

Third, animation is way better. It‚Äôs just way more satisfying and feels more like Star Wars. The 2008 looks like a thing made with one single computer that uses just a couple of basic character models. The cinematography is also better imo. You got beautiful shots in 2003 version while in the 2008 they don‚Äôt really care for good looking shots, just for a story line.
 
Fourth, the clones make more sense. Like the Kaminoans  said in Epsiode II, they follow order without question. That‚Äôs exactly what they don‚Äôt do in the 2008 version. They are way too independent and don‚Äôt have any flaws even though they should have a big one: Blindly following orders.

Fifth, the battles are very cool and are very enjoyable. Both space, ground battles and lightsaber fights.

Last, the 2003 version is less childish and depends more on visuals and not on some crappy childish dialogue. 

That‚Äôs it. If you disagree, please don‚Äôt downvote, just share me your thoughts.

Everything I consider canon from the 2003 show:

Like sure make all the convoluted logical backflips you want about Anakin and Ashoka and all them, but like did Yoda discover this secret and have Mace do the same thing before his death at the hands of Palpatine?

58,I'm new to the Star Wars franchise (Spoilers for MCU as well),1599904728,"My prior experience with Star Wars is severely limited, based off of references heard in other media. Here's what I know:

1. There are storm-troopers in white and black plastic suits, or at least they look like plastic suits, even though they are shown to be some serious armor.
2. There are bear-like creatures, wookies, or e-voks, or chewies, or whatever it is they're called.
3. Some major characters are Luke, Leia, Han Solo, Chewie, Obi Wan Kenobi, C3PO, R2D2, Yoda, Jaba and Darth Vader. Luke and Leia have a romance going, they don't know they're siblings, and Luke doesn't know Darth Vader is his dad.
4. The franchise is largely about space ships, robots, aliens, sci-fi laser tech etc.

These things were spoiled for me because of how popular Star Wars is, and how almost every other film and show in existence feels compelled to make references to Star Wars under the assumption that everyone has already watched the films. I wish I didn't know that Darth Vader is the father, but maybe that's not so important (or is it?)

Anyway, I've watched the original Star Wars movie a few weeks back, and now I'm watching ""Rogue One"" which seem considerably more HD and newer. The sheer amount of irrelevant information pouring in is overwhelming. I really wish the story gave me more reasons to care about what's happening on the screen, but it doesn't. This is also a very different kind of sci-fi than I'm used to and generally tend to like. I enjoy advanced tech that's scientifically realistic and cutting edge, like the Iron Man suit. But the sci-fi in Star Wars seems to be more like what kids from the 60s and 70s thought the future would look like. There are lightsabers and laser guns going off everywhere, and after having watched the MCU already, it feels difficult to get myself in the zone where the Star Wars science feels satisfying.

I still don't know all of the story, and I request people on here to not post any spoilers in here. I just want to know if I'm going about this the wrong way or something. I want to enjoy the franchise, I want to connect to the story, but it just isn't happening. I don't want to have to arbitrarily like something just because it's already popular, I need some objective, unbiased display of good substance to naturally feel that ""yes, this stuff is worth watching"".

So, any advice for a newbie like me? I'm also looking to watch the Mandalorian (and any other TV shows there might be in this franchise), and play the Star Wars games too. If you've got any watch orders that are suitable for a good story-telling experience, let me know. No chronological orders unless the story unfolds that way.

69,"Disney and the ST are criticized by many fans, so i wanted to know how others feel compared to what i feel..",1599900496,"So, after Disney took over, first things first, it discarded the entire EU content as legends to set stage for itself which was very disappointing, (though it is an debatable point that many novels and canon material released under Disney were good in their own ways).

The thing that infuriated me the most was when Disney was announced that Anakin Skywalker (Undoubtedly my favourite character after Obi Wan in star wars) was no longer The Chosen One and made Rey the Chosen One just to fit their story line. Clearly all along it was stated that anakin was the chosen one in the prequels and the Father himself told and proved that Anakin was the chosen one whilst in Mortis. 

You also probably know about how GL felt betrayed when Disney unofficially promised George of upholding his idea buy taking his script but instead later they discarded it. Disney was not wrong, i never felt they were wrong, but they really should have told GL upfront went taking over LucasFilm.

Don't get me wrong here, Disney gave a lot to us in the recent years, but i really don't like how they changed some basic foundations like that of the Chosen One.

79,I recently just watched the original trilogy and the prequels for the first time; here's my final thoughts.,1599895691,"Going ahead and labeling this as spoilers, since it's better to be safe than sorry. I've obviously heard about Star Wars my whole life, but I never took the time to watch them. I'm really glad I did, overall I very much enjoyed all of the movies. But, I probably have the opposite opinion of many in this sub: I liked the prequels exponentially more than the originals.

&amp;#x200B;

I watched 4-6 first, basically just going through the movies by release order. I wouldn't really be able to give a detailed opinion on every single individual movie, so I'll just summarize how I felt about both trilogies. To be honest, I don't completely understand why they're as revered as they are. They weren't bad per se, but there were multiple things in them that kinda took me out (some of these may be caused by the limitations of the time, but nonetheless):

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, the acting was... kinda bad for some characters. Maybe it was just the way they were written, or the actors themselves, but for instance, Han Solo. His ""witty"" and ""snarky"" dialogue felt very forced and played up. I also kinda had this problem for Leia, but not to that extent. This wasn't for all characters, though, as I felt that characters like Vader, Luke, and 3PO were amazingly played, and I really enjoyed the majority of the scenes they took part in. Another thing that took me out were the lightsaber battles that just looked like playfighting. Obviously not every single one, but, for example, the battle between Obi-Wan and Vader that just looked like they were play-fighting with sticks. Aside from those battles and some other great moments, the story really didn't feel too fleshed out. From what I can remember, there was the conflict with Jabba, then the Death Star and killing Emperor Palpatine. It was interesting to see Luke's powers and character progress throughout the movies, but overall, maybe it just wasn't my cup of tea? I'm not sure. The prequels, though...

&amp;#x200B;

I loved the prequels a lot. Amazing acting, great story, beautiful depictions of areas in the universe, it really got me invested into the progression of Anakin and his path towards the dark side. Before I start getting into what I liked about them, I'll go ahead and rattle off what I didn't like abou them.

&amp;#x200B;

\- The very cheesy love story between Padme and Anakin really didn't draw me in very much. It was nice to see Anakin have both a motivation and a flaw that ultimately led to his downfall, but the segments where it was just those 2 flirting and nothing else weren't the most entertaining.

&amp;#x200B;

\- I noticed a few continuity errors (I can't come up with them all off the top of my head , but one was R2's technology and how it advanced throughout the prequels - it makes no sense timeline-wise how he'd have all of these powers to then just not use most of them in the originals) which were odd.

&amp;#x200B;

\- A specific issue I had was when Palpatine fought off 5 or 6 Jedis with complete ease - it made no sense how he reeled back for, like, 2 seconds and still managed to get a completely clear shot on a Jedi. Plus, when Mace Windu finally gets Palpatine on the ground, he states that he was placing him under arrest, then shortly afterwards tells Anakin ""HE'S TOO DANGEROUS TO BE KEPT ALIVE!"" like you were just about to keep him alive! It's like they completely forgot what his motives were with Palpatine.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, what I loved: the characters featured in the prequels are some of my all-time favorites, with my top favorite being Obi-Wan. It's so interesting to watch him go from Qui-Gon's apprentice to a highly revered Jedi Master, and then into exile to avoid the Empire. Anakin's progression was also amazing, seeing him and Palpatine interact as Palpatine slowly planted seeds into Anakin's mind that eventually made him turn to the dark side. Even the characters that people hated didn't bother me. I never really hated Jar-Jar's role in the movies, or his story or progression. I thought it was brilliant how they used his stupidity to play in to the conquering of the Republic. 

&amp;#x200B;

The movie itself looked amazing (again, a product of its time). I loved when events took place in Coruscant, as I loved seeing the dazzling futuristic city.

&amp;#x200B;

The overall story I felt was much more fleshed out and interesting than the original trilogy, with multiple plots being layered and intertwined throughout scenes. Plus, that twist at the end with Order 66 was absolutely jaw-dropping. I almost was anticipating that moment, as you see all of the actions that Palpatine took all come together to form this brilliantly crafted scheme to take over the Republic and wipe out most of the Jedi. These were also some of the only movies to actually make me tear up, seeing Anakin being transferred into his suit and told the truth. Realizing that he was so powerless was gut-wrenching as I looked back and remembered what he came from.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously, these are just my opinions, but nonetheless this was still an amazing experience, and I'm looking forward to exploring the Star Wars universe even more past the movies.",StarWars,SpamBuckett6,False,/r/StarWars/comments/ir88ob/i_recently_just_watched_the_original_trilogy_and/

There might be some loop holes to this theory so sorry if I doesn't make any sense to you. 


Ok. Here we go.


So I was in the shower going through Episode 3 dialogue and one particular line stood out to me. In the exchange between Anakin and Obi-Wan preceding the Mustafar fight Obi-Wan says this ""Anakin, my allegiance is to the Republic, to democracy."" That line caught me off guard because if, as Mace Windu said, the Jedi were keepers of the peace and not soldiers, why would the Jedi's allegiance be to the Senate/Repiblic? I may not have this all figured out but please try to bear with me. This is all new in my head. 


It was in either in Episode 2 or Episode 3 that Mace Windu tells Yoda that they (Windu and Yoda) should inform the Council or Senate that they can no longer use the Force to their maximum ability anymore. Keep that in mind for later on. (Spoilers for Clove Wars season 7 ahead just in case you haven't seen it yet.) In Episode 3 there is little talk about some ""outer rim sieges"". Those ""outer rim sieges"" are explored in The final season of Clone Wars. This is also when ol' Palps gets ""kidnapped"" by Dooku and Grievous by the way. The Jedi are given a choice, do they go help the Mandalorians who, Obi-Wan had a connection to at one point, or do they ""play politics"", as Ahsoka says, and rescue the Chancellor. That phrase, ""playing politics"" stands out to me. Why would the Jedi be playing politics? They were formed because of their devotion to the Light side of the Force. They are not supposed to be political. 


Now to my MAIN POINT of writing this mess of a theory.


Return of the Jedi is named the way it is not because of Luke, but because Luke was able to sense the good in Anakin (Vader at the time). I recently rewatched the Prequels and one thing disturbed me. Obi-Wan said he loved Anakin. Why did he leave Anakin on Mustafar to burn, and quite literally, die. If you truly loved someone and they went down a wrong path, wouldn't you try to save them from that dark path? Put yourself in Obi-Wan's robes for a sec. Lol, lil pun there. You found this kid on a waste land of a planet and your master says he's the chosen one and will do all these crazy things. You end up training the boy, per your master's request and you watch this kid grow up. You love this kid. He ends up falling into the wrong crowd. Wouldn't you want to try to save this kid you grew up with? Also, why was Luke able to sense the good in Anakin but not Obi-Wan? If the Jedi were able to use 100% of their power, like Luke was, they would have been able to sense the conflict in Anakin just as Luke said he could in episode 6. We know that Vader was never truly a devoted Sith. He was always think about Padm√© and he even admits it in Return of the Jedi.


So basically, what I'm trying to say is: Because the Jedi have strayed from their core ideals (being a religious group of devoted Light Side users), they lose their ability to use the Force. Because of this, Obi-Wan can't see that Anakin is conflicted, thus leaving him on Mustafar to die which allows Palpatine to recover Anakin.

14,I need to say this to someone,1599876039,"So I just watched Star Wars Theory‚Äôs video about Rey and her lineage and I can tell that he is genuinely mad at Disney and fed up with their bullshit. 

In the description of his video he stated that Dave Filoni and Jon Favreau are the future of Star Wars and that only then can save it. 

This leads into the new class of Star Wars fans that I have somewhat created called ‚ÄúGeorge Lucas Loyalists‚Äù. 

George Lucas Loyalists (As I consider myself) are loyal to George Lucas and how he handled the franchise. And even though he appointed Kathleen Kennedy to the President of Lucasfilm his true heir is Dave Filoni, much like The Emperor and Vader (This would make Jon Favreau a Sith assassin much like Asajj or Starkiller).

Disney, and more specifically Kathleen Kennedy, Rian Johnson, and JJ Abrams to a lesser degree, don‚Äôt believe in George Lucas‚Äô vision for Star Wars after he sold it in 2012 and see it more as a movie franchise that makes a lot of money and less like a franchise that, throughout several decades and generations, has touched many fans from many walks of life. Just look at how divisive the fan base is. 

There are all around fans that just like Star Wars and doesn‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs good (more or less casual fans). There are Star Wars elitists that believe the Original Trilogy was the only good thing to come out of Star Wars. There are memers that love the stupid dialogue of the prequels no matter how bad it is. And then there are non-Star Wars fans who see it from the outside-in. ‚ÄúThe Prequels are bad and the Originals are good and the Sequels are okay and the Mandalorian is the first Star Wars tv show ect‚Äù I believe that the reason that Disney failed was because they were trying to pander to the casual and non Star Wars fans by releasing the new Star Wars movies like the OT that it would remind them of the OT. The Resistance and the First Order parallels the Rebels and Empire so much that it makes almost no sense. They try to remind you that the OT is good because they think that the Prequels suck and that everyone hates them, so they try and make you forget about the Prequels and remind you of the ‚ÄúHigh Point‚Äù of Star Wars and they failed. 

George Lucas would‚Äôve made a brand new story, while embracing the rest of the franchise. He would‚Äôve created a story that the fans liked and that actually made sense because George Lucas, and therefore, Filoni and Favreau, treated the content with love because it was something that they would‚Äôve enjoyed themselves.

Just look at all of the EU material that we have gotten since 2012. I don‚Äôt think that it is a coincidence that the majority of ‚Äúspinoff material‚Äù that Disney has made takes place AFTER the Prequels and BEFORE the OT: Solo, Roque One, Rebels, Fallen Order, Vader Immortal, Bad Batch, and a lot of the Comics take place after 19BBY. Not saying that any of that stuff is bad necessarily (far from it), but they are obviously pandering to the OT and trying not to remind you of the ‚Äúbad‚Äù era of Star Wars, the Prequels. Even look at the MUSIC in TRoS. The soundtrack for that movie sucked ass (NOT JOHN WILLIAMS FAULT HE DID NOTHING WRONG) and was extremely derivative of the previous movies but NO music from the prequels at all. 


TL,DR/Summary: George Lucas Loyalists believe in George Lucas, Dave Filoni, and Jon Favreau to handle Star Wars; Disney was a bunch of pansy-ass morons in that trying to make the Sequels appeal to everyone, it ended up appealing to no one; and Disney tried to hide the ‚Äúmistakes‚Äù that was Episodes I, II, and III while trying to recreate the OT and epically failed because they‚Äôre a massive company whose only goal is to make as much money as possible instead of making good films that are good because they were made with attention and care.

Just finished The Mandalorian (late to the party) and loved it. After watching I looked up to see if there was any discussion about Boba and Jango Fett to see how they tied into it (especially with the new information we have learned about the Mandalorians in the series.  

I'm not sure if this is just a continuity thing because of the new timelines or what. They don't use Beskar despite both being of great repute and with all sorts of feats of strength. Jango takes off his helmet all the time. Filoni and Lucas say that they aren't. 

Building on what we know from the Clone Wars, its possible that stuff like the helmet rule are fairly new. We see the death watch saving Mando as a kid, and we knew from TCW that the death watch were the only warriors at the time, so maybe the new rules stem from the extremist warriors being the only ones to survive (and/or reverting back to pre-peace Mandalorian societal codes). Almec in TCW also says that the Fetts aren't mandalorians, but he is also known as someone who lies all the time. 

HOWEVER, most importantly: in a meta sense all of the above arguments one way or the other seem absolutely ridiculous. Boba Fett's armour was the prototype for everything related to Mandalorians, and the revelation that he is a clone of Jango seemed to build on that. It just is kind of bizarre that consensus is that the two original mandalorians are only fake ones wearing similar armor, considering the idea of mandalorians is based on those two and their armor.",StarWars,Titanspaladin,False,/r/StarWars/comments/iqzzhf/it_seems_strange_that_boba_and_jango_are_now/

40,Why I will always appreciate the Force Awakens,1599843086," So I was born in 2005 so I never got to see the Prequels in theaters. I was pretty much just a casual Star Wars fan but I did LOVE the Clone Wars And I played the Original Battlefront 2. I didn't know much about the History of it and really just didn't care that much.
And then the Force Awakens came out.
I loved this movie. Especially the first half. Finn was my favorite character in the Movie and I just couldn't wait until the next movie to see what happens to him. I watched alot of YouTube videos about theorys of who Snoke was and Who were Reys parents. The theorys mentioned new characters I have never heard of so I just kept learning more and more about the history.
I came out of the last Jedi feeling disappointed because I just thought it was boring and all I wanted was to see Luke actually fight Kylo Ren. So I decided to go back to the prequels and I realized how good The Phantom Menace and Revenge of the Sith actually were and now they are my favorite Star Wars movies to watch (I know their not better than the OT) and now Anakin/Darth Vader is my favorite Star Wars character. 
The Rise of Skywalker came out and I was hoping for it to be better than The Last Jedi and in my Opinion it was. I was still sad that Anakin didn't return but I still enjoyed it.
Anyway my point is that The Force Awakens opened my eyes to how great this franchise really is and now Revan is my second favorite character. The EU is my headcanon because I just like how they handled the era more but I still appreciate the Firce Awakens for what it did to my life",StarWars,SuperGonk23,False,/r/StarWars/comments/iqubo0/why_i_will_always_appreciate_the_force_awakens/

42,Why Count Dooku is the unsung hero of Star Wars,1599842895," 

You know, everyone says Star Wars the clone wars (the animated series) is so amazingly spectacular, and I agree! But there's one thing, one glaring thing about it that I can not forgive. How they treat Count Dooku.

In the show, Dooku is a 2 dimensional villain who has no motive other than ""I am an evil Sith, ooh look at me, I'm Christopher Lee animated. I want a worthy apprentice!""

If you'll remember, in the films they state that Dooku is a Jedi turned Sith. Well that's all fine and dandy until you actually take a closer look and listen to what he's saying. You realize Count Dooku is right.

In Episode II he warns Obi-Wan the Jedi are being manipulated. He says they can work together and destroy the Sith. Even throughout all his dialogue he has little hints to his true allegiance, like still referring to himself as a Jedi, ""My Jedi powers are far stronger than your own"" In Episode III he has a look of genuine sadness and betrayal when he pleads for Anakin not to kill him.

What am I getting at? Well only something so glaringly obvious that I'm surprised more Star Wars fans don't know it. Count Dooku WAS A GOOD GUY!

He didn't turn to the Sith. He was a double agent for the Jedi. Now, the Jedi order didn't know about this. He realized if they knew what he was up to Palpatine would eventually find out. As he routinely wormed his way into Jedi affairs. So he didn't tell them. The only person who knew he was still loyal to the Jedi was himself.

You're thinking ""But he did all those horrible things!"" Yeah, yeah he did. You can't be a convincing Sith without getting your hands dirty. Dooku soiled his name, reputation, and conscience, all for the sake of the greater good.

The world would never know of his sacrifice, he'd go down in history as a war criminal of the worst kind. Count Dooku was a true patriot of the Jedi.

In the end though, he did tell someone. He took a gamble. A young Jedi named Obi-Wan Kenobi. He told him what he'd learned, about the Sith influencing the Jedi from the shadows. He tried to get Obi-Wan's trust. He needed someone now who was still a trusted Jedi, someone who could continue the part of the job he no longer could. He needed his help, he... was his only hope.

And Obi-Wan refused. Blinded by years of Jedi dogmatism he refused to believe there could be any good in Dooku. Even until the very end he fought against him not believing a word he said. Until he died. In the following days Obi-Wan remembered what Dooku told him. Suspicion grew in his mind that perhaps the Jedi really were being manipulated. It was this suspicion that led to them becoming wary of Palpatine. Eventually uncovering that he was indeed a Sith and forcing his hand. Palpatine converting Anakin and killing all the Jedi.

Yes, this was his plan from the start. Would anything different have happened had they not begun to suspect him? No, not really. He would have converted Anakin anyway and still initiated Order 66. The end result would be the same. Except for one thing, something so small yet so large. Time. Because of their suspicions Palpatine, aka Darth Sidious, enacted his plan sooner than expected.

What would this have changed, you ask? Luke, the son of Skywalker. Had the events of Episode III happened any later than they did, Padme would have already given birth to her twin children. You could argue that she gave birth at the end because she was dying and had to save her children, but just by looking at the babies you can see they were perfectly healthy and would've been born soon anyway.

Had Anakin's children already been born, it's certain that Sidious would have hunted them down and killed them. But he didn't, everyone though Anakin's children died with Padme. And from the ashes of apparent darkness, hope was born, *a new hope.*

The enemy would be a group of force users that were never discovered by the Jedi or Sith, so they had no training by either. This could make them a ""grey"" faction, to say. This group will try to destabilize the Republic by conducting precision assassinations and terror attacks. The Jedi must try to stop them.

66,The Resistance Bomber could be the best bomber in Star Wars with two very simple mods.,1599838009,"A lot of people give the MG-100 Starfortress a lot of flak, mostly for being slow and fragile, that however, is only half true, The MG-100 is approximately 40-50% the speed of a T-70, which is 1250km/h, that gives us about 600 km/h top speed. This is only 200 less than the BTL-A4, and only 100 less than the BTL-B, so slow, but not nearly as slow as you may think. It‚Äôs also anything but fragile, the first bomber we see go down took from my count, at least 7 full TIEsf strafes before going down, and slowly at that. TIE sfs carry heavy laser cannons, and a single shot is enough to destroy a T-70, yet it took up to 20 something to down the bomber.

The primary flaw of the design is turret coverage, every angle is covered, except for front bottom, and the the TIE that gets the kill on the first bomber by exploiting that. 

The First mod is to simply replace the 4 fixed cannons front with a bubble turret, same as the other two on the craft, this increases crew necessary but also vastly improves the already fantastic defensive coverage. With this change, the MG-100 now has 4 dual bubble turrets, and two dual side coaxial guns, that‚Äôs 12 laser cannons facing every direction, put 20 of the things together and you can forget about a fighter assault on it. 

The second simple mod is to alleviate the only other threat to the bombers, turbo lasers, to solve this we simply install 2 to 4 shield generators in the rear hallway area leading to the back gun, with the extra power afforded by removing two heavy guns, we can fit up to 4 additional shield bubbles in the craft. With already impressive shielding, I‚Äôd imagine this allows the Star fortress to shrug off several direct turbolaser hits. Keep in mind, The forward profile of this thing is actually very small. And hard to hit, especially if you swerve the ship back and forth as you approach whatever unfortunate target you have in mind.

TL:DR, with a few changes to the weaponry and internal components, the SF/17, MG-100 Starfortress would easily be the best bomber choice for a proper military, especially when deployed in actual numbers.

99,"[Mandalorian S2 Speculation] How Ahsoka and Luke will Tie-Into the Story. Dagobah, The New Jedi Order, Luke‚Äôs foreshadowed downfall, and how it all connects.",1599821741," 

First off, this is just speculation; there is absolutely no proof for any of this. But God hates a coward, so here we go. 

(TL;DR) Unaware of his death, Ashoka brings the child and Mando to Dagobah To meet Master Yoda. Instead, she finds Luke Skywalker. 

How  Ahsoka creates a bridge between all three trilogies and foreshadows Luke‚Äôs downfall.

**The Theory**

I believe season two will focus on Mando‚Äôs quest to help find the Child‚Äôs ‚Äúpeople‚Äù whether this means other Yoda-like creatures or force users, both can work with this theory. 

Drawn to the Child‚Äôs immense force connection, Ahsoka Tano tracks down Mando and the Child. After meeting the Child, She proposes they go to Dagobah to seek the counsel of her old teacher, master Yoda. At this point in canon, we don‚Äôt know where Ahsoka was during the Original Trilogy, but we can make an assumption that she‚Äôs not aware of Yoda‚Äôs death.

Upon arrival on Dagobah, they find Yoda‚Äôs hut has been vacant for some time, but she senses someone strong in the force. The force guides her to man by a fire outside of a cave. She senses a familiar force signature; similar but different.

The shadowy figure introduces himself as Luke Skywalker. Ahsoka explains that she was once his father‚Äôs apprentice and served with Obi-wan Kenobi. Luke asks about who his father was before he was Vader. Until this point, Luke knows very little about the man Anakin Skywalker was, so it would be nice to see him learn about his father. Luke explains that Yoda passed away years before. He has come to Dagobah to use the cave, but the answers he received were clouded. Luke, emboldened by his victory at Endor, explains that he is a Jedi and wants to build a temple to train others and revive the Order. 

Luke asks Ahsoka to join him and help guide him in the ways of the Jedi. Ahsoka refuses.

&gt;Ahsoka laments that ‚Äúthe Jedi fell because of their hubris, arrogance, and hypocrisy; their legacy is one of failure, you are romanticizing the old ways, and repeating the same mistakes. Sometimes it‚Äôs best to let the old ways die‚Äù. This quote is a version of what Luke will say to Rey years later. She explains that a strong, pure connection with the force is more important than a thousand years of dogma and doctrine.

Ahsoka places her hand over Luke‚Äôs; we see a vision of a burning temple; a lost son; an angry Luke brandishing his saber; the Emperor laughing. Ashoka pulls away, ‚Äúabandon these plans,‚Äù  she says, ‚Äùthe path you are going down only leads to pain and suffering‚Äù, She says he has much of his father in him and must be careful of his feelings.

Ashoka leaves him by the fire to join Mando and the child. Mando asks if Luke is the one they were looking for.‚Äù No,‚Äù she says, ‚Äúbut there is another.‚Äù

Hear me out, I know that Bastila and Satele aren‚Äôt technically canon, but hey it‚Äôs Star Wars. 

So my idea is that Snoke (before being killed off in TLJ) was an ancient enemy, maybe even the Prime Jedi. The reason I get this idea is mainly because of the Sigil seen on Ahch To which shows a figure not too different in likeness from Snoke. 

Anyway, if they wanted to make the story about mainly about Rey, they could have introduced Snoke to be some ancient big bad from around the time of the Old Republic (canon version of Vitiate perhaps o_o) and revealed her descent to be of the Shans.

16,How to fix the prequels with one change,1599774634,"It‚Äôs Episode 1. Obi Wan and his master, Qui Gon Jinn, are fighting Darth Maul. Obi is trapped by impenetrable laser gates. He must watch helplessly as Qui Gon is killed by the menacing Darth Maul.

Obi is devastated. He finally exits the laser gates, and after a short skirmish, Obi unceremoniously slices Darth Maul in half.

Story-wise, this is the biggest mistake of the whole series. Obi Wan‚Äôs lust for revenge is one of the most powerful emotions in the prequel trilogy. And it‚Äôs satisfied in a matter of moments.

What if, instead of Obi Wan getting immediate revenge for his master‚Äôs death, Darth Maul escapes.

With his dying breath, Qui Gon tells Obi Wan to train Anakin. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs the chosen one.‚Äù Inside, Obi Wan‚Äôs desire for revenge burns. In his eyes, we see Obi Wan‚Äôs dark secret: he will hunt down and kill Darth Maul at any cost.

Obi Wan spends the final part of Episode I and the beginning of Episode II split between dark and light: his desire to kill the elusive Darth Maul, and his desire to train Anakin.

The two desires become conflicted in him, to the point that Obi Wan, offstage between episodes I and II, brings Anakin on ill-fated attempts to hunt down Darth Maul, even though Anakin is far too young.

Obi Wan is obsessed. He scours the galaxy for Maul to no avail. Yoda warns him against it, but it‚Äôs no use.

It‚Äôs Episode II. There‚Äôs an attempt on the Queen‚Äôs life. Despite Yoda‚Äôs protests, the Jedi Council puts Obi Wan on a mission: find the bounty hunter responsible for the attempt on Queen Padme‚Äôs life. Obi Wan uses the mission as a guise to further his search for Maul.

Enter the clones: on the mysterious ocean planet of Kamino, Obi Wan finds legions of clones being produced for the Republic.

Obi Wan wishes to use the clones in his hunt for Maul. He propositions Palpatine, saying he needs the clones to aid his hunt for the assassination attempt on the queen.

Sensing the conflict between light and dark in both Obi Wan and Anakin, Palpatine grants Obi Wan access to the 101st regiment of clone troopers.

Palpatine knows that if Obi Wan gives in to his dark desires for revenge, his transformation to the dark side will be inevitable. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a trap, Obi Wan!‚Äù we yell in the audience, but it‚Äôs too late‚ÄîObi Wan is too blind by obsessive rage to see Palpatine‚Äôs plot.

Obi Wan‚Äôs battalion hunts for Darth Maul with no success until Episode III. At the same time Anakin gets word that Padme is pregnant, Obi wan is informed by Major Twelve of the 101st that they have finally tracked down Maul, but they must act quickly if they want to catch him before he escapes again.

After years on the hunt, the battalion is as blood thirsty as Obi wan. But Obi tells them to wait for his arrival.

The time is nigh for Obi Wan to exact his revenge. But just as he‚Äôs about to set coordinates for Maul‚Äôs hiding place, he gets word from Yoda: trouble in the Jedi Temple.

Obi Wan sees footage of Anakin massacring younglings. Finally, it dawns on him. Palpatine has infected both master and apprentice, feeding Anakin‚Äôs desire to save Padme, and feeding Obi Wan‚Äôs desire to avenge his fallen master.

Now, Obi Wan must choose: does he go to the volcano planet Mustafar to stop Anakin from killing separatist leaders, thus completing his transformation into Darth Vader, or does Obi follow his dark desire to kill Darth Maul?

Obi Wan chooses the light. Suddenly, the climactic battle between master and apprentice has even higher stakes: they are *both* fighting the light and dark side of the force within themselves, as well as in each other.

Obi Wan sees clearly what the Emperor has done to them, and he pleads with Anakin to come back to the light.

Anakin insists that he‚Äôs only followed his training: Obi Wan‚Äôs actions in seeking vengeance on Darth Maul showed him that the dark side is necessary.

Obi Wan is devastated. As the movies stand now, when he says ‚ÄúI have failed you Anakin‚Äù it comes off as disingenuous and borderline passive aggressive. But in this version, Obi Wan truly means it: he did fail Anakin.

Obi let his lust for revenge get in the way of Anakin‚Äôs training and allowed Palpatine to swoop in in his absence.

Now when Obi Wan strikes down Anakin, it not only cements Anakin‚Äôs place in the dark, it cements Obi Wan‚Äôs place in the light, an internal battle that wasn‚Äôt at stake in the real version of the movie.

Obi Wan gives up his hunt for Darth Maul in the decades between episodes III and IV. He also gives up looking for Vader. Wiser now, he knows what he lost when he sought vengeance before. Never again‚Ä¶until a bright flicker of springs forth to make up for past mistakes in the form of a young moisture farmer named Luke Skywalker.

21,So I re-watched the Prequels recently and....,1599773664,"The Prequel trilogy seemed to be getting a new array of love and appreciation after the sequels ended it's run, so I decided to give them another look since its been so long since I watched them, and.......... yeah, I still don't like em. I'm sorry I tried. One thing I got out from them was a new appreciation for what the filmmakers were trying to do, I was so young when I watched them that I never noticed how expanses the lore adds to the Jedi, and the allegories it has to the politcal climate in america at the time it was released. I like how it really shows what the jedi can do in their prime and what the dark side can really do to someones mind. The saber fights were awesome and fun to watch, even if they were a bit to perfect in it's choreography but I can't deny it was still fun to watch. I also like how flawed the Jedi are portrayed to be which sort of surprised me since there a little more restrictive than their clone wars series counterparts but I felt it made them more interesting. There also certain moments that are felt were really great cinematic moments like Anakin and padme sensing each other from far away in episode 3 or palpatine telling the story of plaguis the wise in the same movie. Oh and I love the memes.

But with that said I just can't called them good movies. Revenge of the Sith is the most Ok out of all of them but that's not saying much. I really wasn't a fan of the dialogue, especially in attack of clones, and there moments that actually made me cringe. The main issue, I have not just with Star Wars but with all of prequel stories in general is how it changes certain elements from their original works. I know this has been a popular criticism of the prequels that has sort of become a dead horse at this point and I'm really sorry but I can kind of agree with them. Adding things such a midichlorians I felt ruins the mystical aspects of the force and turned want was a simple good vs evil story in the original into something more unnecessarily convoluted. I'm really not a fan of making Anakin Skywalker a chosen one, this is an unpopular opinion but It's a case of taking something mundane and making it bigger than it actually is. I liked how in Return of the Jedi , Vader kills palpatine cause he was frying his son, the one thing that was keeping parts of him in the light side of the force and it was Luke that allowed him too fully overcome dark side, but the prequels takes that and makes it this whole prophecy and It just took away the relatability of that, I'm glad the clone wars series doesn't mention it at all.

Now I did sort of like Anakin joining the dark side because he wanted to save padme rather than because he disagreed with the Jedi, which he did, but I'm glad it wasn't the main reason as it would have made his eventual redemption really questionable, but I sadly can't get behind his turning because the romance is ruined by the terrible dialogue and awkward acting and I might say is the worst part of the movies aside from the character of JarJar binks in Episode 1. The CGi is okay for it's time but is very noticeable and distracting in certain scenes especially in episode 1 and 2. While some of the fight scenes are fun to watch, they tend to drag on to the point that they become boring and in fact a lot of aspects of the prequels felt so boring despite the intriguing world building, the one thing I hate the most is when a movie makes me constantly check my clock or worse, fall asleep. Also this is a bit of a nitpick but I had watched the Genndy tartakovsky animated clone wars series prior to re-watching episode 3 and I was angry that the general grievous that was so menacing and badass from that series was not the one I saw in episode 3 but that's just me.

In summary I can understand why many fans are finding new appreciation for the prequals after being burnt out from the sequel trilogy but These movies are just not for me. I tried to like em but outside of some world building and action, I just couldn't enjoy them. On the bright side they did give birth to the 2D and 3D animated series that's takes the lore from the movies and makes it better so that's a plus I guess.",StarWars,KensukeTanabe,False,/r/StarWars/comments/iqcuul/so_i_rewatched_the_prequels_recently_and/

64,The Chosen One...,1599740955,"So, having just finished off my first full re-watch through the Skywalker saga, I had some thoughts regarding the Chosen One Prophecy.
The generally accepted theory within the canon is that Anakin was the chosen one who would bring balance to the force. There are multiple mini theories within this aiming to detail exactly when the prophecy is fulfilled, mostly at the point of his redemption when Vader ‚Äúkills‚Äù the emperor. I put that in speechmarks since following the finale of the sequals, RoS, we see that he wasn‚Äôt truely killed, and so the waters start to get a little murkier.

But the idea struck me that the interpretation of the prophecy was completely misunderstood. Anakin DID bring balance to the force. And the moment it was fulfilled would have been after he turned and the Jedi Purge went into effect. Up until a thousand years before these events, the Jedi had been a dominant and widespread force, whereas the Sith, under Darth Banes‚Äô Rule of Two, had hid in the shadows.

Due to the nature of the force being neither good nor evil, this created a near constant imbalance in the force. Anakin/Vader represented this imbalance righting itself by becoming the catalyst for the purge. 

By the time of the events prior to ANH, the only Jedi remaining were Obi-Wan and Yoda. Likewise, the only Sith, Vader and Sidious.
(And for arguements sake, if we include Jedi and Sith for non-saga based medium such as Rebels/Clone Wars, ect ect, we can at least assume the balance of power remained the same for a long time after, at least until the break up of the Empire anyways)

But yeah, that‚Äôs my two galactic credits on the prophecy anyways ‚úåüèª

82,Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker changed my relationship with the franchise.,1599724397,"I used to defend this new Disney-era of Star Wars. Since then, I've changed my mind because Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is everything that I dislike about the current state of Star Wars. I've gone back and forth on whether I enjoy the movie or dislike it. The sequel heroes mean a lot to me because The Force Awakens was my first Star Wars theater experience and I love The Last Jedi. This is the only reason that I enjoyed The Rise of Skywalker initially and I kind of hate that movie at this point. 

Disney and Lucasfilm are so obsessed with the past right now. The Force Awakens had a ton of similarities to A New Hope, but just getting rid of the New Republic seemed like a mistake. Starkiller Base is the only thing that I really dislike about that movie. Rogue One is bland and overrated if you ask me. It relies too much on your feelings for the OT aesthetic and I find the characters to be boring. Solo is fine, but it doesn't really take risks. The Mandalorian is also fine. I see the appeal, but it's not personally for me. It's a super safe show. But I can at least acknowledge that The Mandalorian seems like it has love and care put into it similar to The Clone Wars or even Rebels. I can't say the same for The Rise of Skywalker, Solo, or Rogue One.

They're clearly corporate products that had studio interference. I know Star Wars is a huge profitable IP and they exist to make money, but this new era hasn't embraced filmmakers giving their own spin on Star Wars. I'm not done with Star Wars, I'm just simply going to ignore the entires that I don't like now. The Rise of Skywalker doesn't have a place in my personal headcanon because I feel that it drags the OT and the first two ST movies down. Daisy and John's recent comments have only pushed me more towards disliking it.

I just hope that directors in the future can truly craft their vision. I'd be upset if Taika Waititi had great ideas and someone higher up suggested changes because his ideas were too risky or odd.",StarWars,ASingleTicTac,False,/r/StarWars/comments/ipz1bb/star_wars_the_rise_of_skywalker_changed_my/

9,"I don‚Äôt think George would have killed Ben Solo, and here is why.",1599710650,"Ben Solo‚Äôs death never sat well with me. I recently watched a video where George talks about fairy tales and how SW was rooted in that kind of a mythos. I think it made me understand why I think JJ/Disney made (IMO) the wrong choice with Ben

At its core, Star Wars has always been about human issues with exaggerated set pieces and events to make those stories more exciting. 

For instance, Lucas had always said that Luke and Vader‚Äôs relationship was kind of like a child of the WW2 era whose father had come back from war, and the trouble they both go through as the kid never knew him before and only heard stories - and the father grappling with the horrible things he had done, learning to be a person again and love his child the way he needs to. 

So when it came to the new movies, I tried to look at them the way I thought Lucas would. Obviously the character I gravitated most towards was Kylo / Ben Solo. 

They built him up as a sympathetic character in the films that has been abused emotionally and never really had anyone that loved him just for the person he was, rather than what he should have been to others. Snoke wanted a Vader, Luke wanted the heir to the Jedi, the world expected a hero, etc. The books and comics really expanded on this part of him, including him being manipulated and disturbed since birth. 

So when people say things like he deserved to die because of Starkiller base, I don‚Äôt really agree. Not only did he object to using it in TFA, but even the ‚Äúhe‚Äôs killed people‚Äù excuse is weird since literally everyone in Star Wars kills people. Luke arguably killed more people than anyone and I‚Äôm sure there were plenty of people on the Death Star that were just regular joes working. 

Anyway... enter Rey. Ben meets someone, regardless of if it‚Äôs romantic or not, that he can understand and feels understands him. She cares for him not because he‚Äôs powerful or because of his bloodline, but because of him. He makes the decision in the 9th movie to leave all the power and everything he thought he wanted behind to go help her, something that is a good payoff and is a nice endcap on the whole feud that started with Anakin and Padme‚Äôs relationship ending and really beginning this whole war due to the pursuit of power, and at a human level, the feeling of always wanting more (of anything) and not being happy with what you have. Ben gives everything up, and basically shows up with no plans, no weapon, etc. All he needs is to make sure she‚Äôs okay because she‚Äôs the one thing he cares about. As Adam said, he finally feels clear in his purpose. 

That all sounds great right? But they literally decide to kill him for no reason other than ‚Äúwell he‚Äôs bad so he had to die‚Äù. He could have lived wandering the galaxy to atone, could have helped rebuild the republic of the Jedi, etc there was a ton of potential for that character. 

The dude smiles for the first time seemingly ever after realizing this person he cares so much for cares for him too, and then he dies. 

JJ killed him literally because ‚Äúidk how you redeem a bad guy‚Äù. 

At a human level. It feels like the lesson changed from ‚Äúit‚Äôs never too late to do the right thing‚Äù to ‚Äúit‚Äôs never too late to do the right thing... as long as you die after because you don‚Äôt deserve to live if you‚Äôve done bad things‚Äù. The 9 film saga ends on tragedy, not hope. 

That‚Äôs just not something George would have done. He understands that this is a grand fantasy, yet telling very human stories and lessons. Whether you like it or not, a key element of his stories are love and forgiveness. I truly believe that George would have had Ben live in whatever way he ended up carrying on, but he would have given him the chance to live a life and better himself and the world around him.",StarWars,kidwifi,False,/r/StarWars/comments/ipw4ys/i_dont_think_george_would_have_killed_ben_solo/

13,"Rey is a Skywalker, people need to deal with it",1599708365,"There is a lot of downright angry sentiment surrounding the development about Rey taking the Skywalker name. Here, I not only talk about how this isn‚Äôt a discussion and that Rey is objectively and canonically a part of the Skywalker family, but why this is *good* for the story. 

First and foremost: Check Wookiepedia. Check the skin in Battlefront 2. Check literally every visual dictionary about TROS. These are official, canon sources (or in the former‚Äôs case, based on official, canon sources). It‚Äôs not a debate, the official owners and current creators of the franchise say so. 

Second, people take names they weren‚Äôt born into all the time. No one is saying Han isn‚Äôt a Solo. That‚Äôs how adoption works. 

Now, it‚Äôs also important thematically. Palpatine spends all three trilogies corrupting or trying to corrupt the Skywalkers into his side. The perfect, poetic way for the Skywalkers to achieve victory over him is not to kill him, but to turn someone from *his* bloodline into their side. 

In addition, the whole theme of the film is that it doesn‚Äôt matter where you come from, you can choose to be different. By taking the name, Rey is saying ‚ÄúI can be a beacon of hope for the Galaxy and the future, even though I come from the most evil place in the galaxy.

The Galaxy is at peace. Twenty years after the fall of the Galactic Empire the New Republic has rebuilt a prosperous society. Jedi Master Luke Skywalker however struggles to reform the fallen Jedi Order as force sensitive children are no longer being discovered. 

Called by a mysterious disturbance in the Force Luke travels into the uncharted and dangerous Unknown Regions of the galaxy to investigate, seeking answers as to why the Force appears to have gone dormant in the galaxy.

Meanwhile, Luke‚Äôs nephew, Ben Solo, one of the few force sensitives born since the fall of the empire, must battle his own conflicted emotions and the ever present temptation of the Dark Side. 

Episode 8: The Last Jedi

The galaxy faces imminent war with the newly discovered First Order which has been amassing strength in the Unknown Regions for twenty years, seeking to restore the Galactic Empire from which it sprang. The New Republic scrambles to militarize under the direction of General Leia Organa, but the defection of her son, now known as Kylo Ren, to the first order has left her shaken and aggrieved. 

Luke Skywalker and his new apprentice, Rey, train in solitude on Ach-To, hoping to prepare her for an inevitable showdown with Kylo and his master, the mysterious and enigmatic Supreme Leader Snoke. 

Meanwhile Poe Dameron and Finn embark on a dangerous mission into the heart of the First Order, seeking the truth about a rumored new Superweapon that the First Order is building to bring their reign of terror to the galaxy. 


Episode IX the rise of Skywalker.

The republic is gone. The massive destruction caused by the Starkiller Bsse‚Äôs activation has thrown the galaxy into chaos. Kylo Ren and his master have begun their conquest of the galaxy, and systems everywhere are surrendering to their might.

Rey, now revealed to be Snoke‚Äôs granddaughter, carries on her fallen master‚Äôs legacy, recruiting newly discovered Force Users from across the galaxy into her new order of Skywalkers to oppose the First Order. 

The only hope of stopping Snoke may be to redeem Kylo Ren and turn him back to the light.

80,Looking For Assistance With A Star Wars Audio Description Project (#TranscribinGames),1599689031,"Hi everyone,
I've replied to some comments here before, but don't think I've necessarily made any posts of my own here.  Well, even if I have, it's time for me to ask for assistance from the community (and no, I'm not going to do the ""you're my only hope"" joke, though that could, arguably, be pretty amusing).

#So What's The Project?
##A Little Context
I am an accessibility consultant and gamer without sight (GWS).  Whilst if you say ""are you blind"" you'd be technically correct, with my primary focus being around the accessibility of videogames, I use the term GWS as ""legal blindness"", often just shortened to being ""blind"", can and often does include usable and/or residual vision, which I've never had.

##So What Is Audio Description?
Audio Description, AD for short, is a secondary audio track that's added to films, TV and theatrical performances amongst other things to allow for understanding of visual information for those who either have visual impairments, no sight at all, or (for instance) just want to imerse themselves whilst completing other tasks (for instance making food).  Whilst it has begun to be increasingly utilised in videogames, with [Ubisoft's Watch Dogs Legion Tipping Point cinematic being a recent example](https://youtu.be/eahpZdoK8t8), it's only really trailers that have embraced the idea for the moment.

###Enter the #TranscribingGames Project
Whilst watching a playthrough of God Of War, which if you want a Star Wars comparison is like Fallen Order but without the lightsaber, I began to think ""how much/what am I missing"".

I reached out on Reddit and, amongst other people, /u/So_Motarded was kind enough to respond and, along with other very kind and generous individuals, assist me in putting together a [guide for God Of War, which can be found on the TranscribingGames main page](http://www.TranscribingGames.sightlesskombat.com]), including numerous audio described videos of that particular game, most if not all of which can be viewed in a playlist on my YouTube channel (which I can link you to if interested).

Now we're coming to the end of the production on those videos (not to say we're completely wrapped with them of course), we're looking for other projects to work on whilst we organise for our next really large-scale endeavour.  It just so happens that I've wanted to, after completing Jedi Fallen Order, try and put some audio described content for the game up as well, especially given that most Star Wars media with a few frustrating exceptions is audio described too.

The starting point for this particular project, to whatever extent it comes to fruition , would be the game's opening cutscene.

##Resources

If you're interested in assisting  with this brief but potentially challenging sequence, here's a few resources:
[A timestamped link to the cutscene in question, this is not the source video I captured but can be used for scripting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SGnZJpvbTg?#t=0m10s).  The source file we use should have silence at the beginning if needed for additional AD, see the next resource for more information on how this can be useful.
[How to write audio description, a document compiled based on this project and with some examples, tips etc](https://1drv.ms/w/s!Ag6ft0w5rxDlgRdwLLYb9ry7-x_w?e=Fj0gTa)
[The first dialogue pass for the opening sequence](https://1drv.ms/w/s!Ag6ft0w5rxDlgngTuFOkyZZ4Y3-e)

If you have any further questions, please feel free to ask and if you'd like to see footage to clarify that I've completed this great game, please feel free to let me know.  If you decide to help out with this scripting effort, or even want to have a go at recording the AD and editing it in yourslelf, I wish you the best of luck and do let us know if you have queries as well.

39,"My theory on Palpatines ""Grand Plan""",1599673057,"I just kinda thought of this and thought what other people might think.

So after some thinking, Palpatines return in the sequels actually isn't surprising. In the Clone Wars show, Maul says that Sidious rarely does anything without a plan. Why would he let the rebellion continue after they destroyed his Death Star? In episode v, Palpatine told Vader that Luke was the son of Anakin and to bring Luke to him. Palpatine fears Anakins power, so a child of Anakin must be at least the same power, if not more. The reason Vader turned was to save Padm√© from death, so him now knowing he has a son, he would try to save Luke any way possible. Palpatine knows this, so what if he was counting on it? I know this isn't canon anymore, but in the Battlefront and Force Unleashed games, you have to deal with Kamino. In battlefront II, you put down a rebellion on Kamino. In the force unleashed, Kamino is experimenting with cloning force users. What if Palpatine shut down the cloning facility after the clone wars ended and repurposed them to clone him after the discovery of Luke's parentage? And with that, he had a way to cheat death (other than his force abilities) and could wait longer to have his rule uninterrupted and without strong opposition. Which means he got Kylo to turn and he knew it would send Luke into exile (the Skywalkers have strong emotions), which means he would be able to rise to power without Luke coming and putting a stop to it. The only reason it failed was because his failed clone had a kid with insane force abilities (Rey) and was fully expecting to have her be by his side, but he did not count on her finding Luke and (somewhat) training her.

That's what I think could've happened (personal head canon you could say), so please tell me any criticism or debunking of this theory or any advice to make it better",StarWars,Red_Panda_007,False,/r/StarWars/comments/ipkmei/my_theory_on_palpatines_grand_plan/
40,This is why Palpatine's Final Order easily destroys the Imperium of Man,1599672935,"The Final Order of Palpatine is the most powerful faction in Star Wars, both in legends and in Disney.  What did Disney give us?  The fastest and most efficient FTL system in science fiction.  The Millennium Falcon jumps across the galaxy at intervals of a few seconds, and at the time of Episode 9, the Falcon is a trash can, while the Order's TIE fighters could jump after him without any preparation. Xyston Star Destroyers can do the same.  And each of them can destroy a planet about the size of the Earth in 10 seconds.  Their reactor is 100 million times more powerful than the Sun [https://www.wired.com/story/how-much-energy-does-it-take-to-blow-up-a-planet/](https://www.wired.com/story/how-much-energy-does-it-take-to-blow-up-a-planet/)  and their shields and turbolasers are many times more powerful than the turbolasers and shields of the Empire's old Star Destroyers.  And there are tens of thousands of such destroyers.  Palpatine said that this fleet is the largest in the galaxy ever.  Imperial Navy - 25 thousand ISD.  Palpatine's fleet should be at least 30-40 thousand. Now ICS TFA is relevant again and 200 gigatons per salvo from a turbolaser does not seem ridiculous.

The Imperium of Man literally cannot stop them.  Tens of thousands of Xystons destroy all important worlds, their weapons are obviously capable of aiming at ships, destroying them instantly.  In addition, the Imperium has only one million worlds, which is said in the most canonical Dark Imperium.  By the most conservative estimates, the Final Order can destroy all the worlds of the Imperium and other factions of the Warhammer universe in one hour.  Also, warhammer fans always forget that Star Destroyers in the Disney canon can hack into the cores of planets and turn these planets into molten slag in a short time, which no battleship or cruiser of the Imperium can do.",StarWars,Foxxie266,False,/r/StarWars/comments/ipkld6/this_is_why_palpatines_final_order_easily/

95,Is the glass on an AT-TE cockpit bulletproof?,1599660944,"For a bit of background, my friends and I are playing a Star Wars roleplay type game. I decided to play as Jango Fett, and through a long and complicated series of events, I became the newest  Mand'alor. Through an equally long and complicated series of events Mandalore and its people are at war with the Republic. I have had my armies mostly make a transition to classic slugthrower weapons seeing that Jedi cannot block or deflect them and Clone armor is made to stop blaster bolts. I was wondering what the chances of the AT-TE glass being bulletproof were because if they weren't that means that every AT-TE only takes 2 or 3 bullets to render completely useless. That would be a major advantage on the battlefield and would severely bring down the number of casualties we would most likely face.

Some of my dreams came true this week as I was lucky enough to have a chat with Jon Knoles who's worked on Star Wars games since the SNES! And worked with George Lucas directly! He directed quite a few of the Star Wars titles including Shadows of The Empire which I thought you all might be interested in. He's super knowledgeable and is a game dev veteran so if there's any budding game devs like myself in here you might find some gems to learn from.

37,"Is it just me, or is *The Mandalorian* S1 Episode 5 *The Gunslinger* add nothing to the programme?",1599643662,"IMO every episode of *The Mandalorian* works well at  either carrying out the plot (episodes 1, 3, 7 &amp; 8) or to flesh out the character of Din Djarin (episodes 2, 4 &amp; 6) and each episode manages this almost exquisitely. I also love how the programme executes it's worldbuilding.


However, episode 5, *The Gunslinger*, has me stumped as to what it's meant to do. It doesn't really add anything to the character of Djarin or continue the plot in any real way. It feels out of place to the overall story and like it exists just for that tease at the end will probably pay off in S2.

It could be argued that episode 6 *The Prisoner* does the same and just exists for the sheer number of guest stars.

But I can also see people's arguments that it's disrespectful to Sebastian Shaw, given that it's his only scene not looking like a shrivelled thumb (although Shaw wasn't even aware what the scene was for and thought it was promo work). There's also the argument that Anakin in his final moments turned back to the light side, so that could negate the point above.

When Palpatine was slowly turning Anakin over to the Dark Side by egging on his ""Chosen One"" status or poisoning his relationship with Jedi &amp; Padme. I realized not once did Palpatine encourage Anakin to hone valuable skills like Defense combat or Balancing. I get he needed Anakin unhinged to make it easier for the end goal but in the long run encouraging Anakin to get better at combat would have helped Anakin in the final duel against Obi-Wan. Anakin would have listened to Palpatine advice regarding how to be better than Obi-Wan, maybe hinting at the obvious fact that Anakin stood no chance  against his former master if he continued to  slack off his training.

61,How Disney Star Wars should‚Äôve been (opinion),1599625147,"I, like a seemingly significant amount of fans, was less than satisfied with the sequel trilogy. 

I believe the ending of Return of the Jedi was the perfect end point for the Skywalker era of Star Wars. 

I have no problems with any stories related to the Skywalker era, such as Rogue One, The Mandalorian, or the upcoming Kenobi series on Disney+, however I believe any story expanding upon the ending of the original trilogy that fans love so much is doomed to fail. 

Anakin is dead, and the prophecy of the chosen one has been fulfilled with Palpatine and Vader‚Äôs deaths. 

Luke‚Äôs arc of redeeming his father while becoming a Jedi Knight is complete. 

Han‚Äôs transformation into a hero and Leia‚Äôs lover is complete. 

I believe there‚Äôs no more logical story to add to these characters post-Original Trilogy and any attempt is simply a cash grab. 

If Disney were to get a reset on the past ~8 years of Star Wars, I would advise them to make either a trilogy set in the distant past, or in the distant future. 

A movie about the knights of the old republic would be welcomed by fans of the expanded universe and would expand the Star Wars timeline like never before. 

A future-based trilogy could show the new Jedi Order and the New Republic centuries after Luke, Leia, and Han helped build them. 

If they wanted, they could even include legacy characters such as descendants of the Skywalker family, or make references to the lasting impacts made by them. 

I mean no disrespect to the cast and crew of the Sequel Trilogy, though I do have some level of resentment for the studio, directors, and writers.

81,Help me see the light of the Mandalorian!,1599616562,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

With Mando S2 coming around the corner, I need some help. 

&amp;#x200B;

I watched the whole first season and the roundtable specials - which I loved! But the actual show I was lukewarm on. All I see are the familiar Star Wars archetypes and adoration of the lore that seems more risk-averse than celebratory. I did enjoy the one episode where Mando and Cara Dune help train the village, but that's yet another ""Seven Samurai"" type of story arc. Don't get me wrong, they are classic story types for a reason. But Star Wars especially has done those to death. 

&amp;#x200B;

Something I think that helps concrete my feelings is this: Mando and IG11 were created so that Favreau and co. can play with the Boba Fett / IG88 type of characters, but save the Real Deal for future movies/tv shows. So it's a basic carbon copy of things we already know and are constantly reminded of - visually and narratively. 

&amp;#x200B;

But I don't want to get to down in the weeds of why I can't get enthusiastic. What do you love about the show? Which characters stand out to you and why? What does the show add or do new that you enjoy?",StarWars,redbeatle,False,/r/StarWars/comments/ip71ps/help_me_see_the_light_of_the_mandalorian/

12,"So I had an idea for an espionage/political show centered on the ISB, love to hear what you guys think",1599607171,"I kind of just wanted to get this idea out there and see what people think about it.

The show is heavily influenced by House of Cards and is set a few years after the Rise of the Empire and end of the Clone Wars on Coruscant. It tells the story of a young agent working in the ISB, who wants to move up but can't due to being blocked by Core World nepotism.

His big break comes when an equally ambitious female senator's aide works with him to bring down her boss and expose a big corruption scandal in the Senate, which allows him to be promoted and for her to position herself for a senator's run. 

The two form a partnership that is mutually beneficial, he makes arrests based on information she feeds him, she moves up the political ladder and gets political wins. His reputation grows as well, and he starts to be assigned harder cases and missions. He also starts to gain other political allies such as Colonel Yularen and Tarkin, however he also makes his fair share of enemies. 

But his investigations aren't limited to Coruscant, he frequently travels to other planets where he goes undercover with a group of bounty hunters or a spice ring, or is on board a Star Destroyer trying to find a saboteur.

She had to deal with the snake pit that is the Imperial Senate and now Moffs. She frequently has to make deals to get bills passed and co-sign other unsavory bills to advance her own goals. She's no angel however, she isn't above framing people and forging evidence to get her way.

He starts off as an Imperial loyalist who blindly believes in the propaganda that the ISB puts out there, however as the show progresses and he sees the absolutely horrific things the ISB does on a daily basis, he starts to change his mind and begins to see how evil the Empire really is.

And finally, I have to say this isn't an action show, it's a drama, political, espionage shown. There will be moments of action but that's not the overall feel of the show.

27,Thrawn is the most emotional Chiss (Thrawn Ascendancy),1599602641,"This was a good read. It is the story on the edge of Star Wars, swapping the known for the unknown, the Republic for the Chaos, and offers a deeper look into an unfamiliar culture and power structure: The Chiss Ascendancy.

What I enjoyed the most was Thrawn‚Äôs depiction as a youth with a naivety that is never seen in Rebels. His character arc grows from the backstory we get from the Chiss Ascendency. The motif of art influencing tactics is well woven into the story. Zahn does a great job of using this as more than a means of propping up Thrawn above his peers and enemies, Zahn uses it to show us how Thrawn creates relationships and builds trust. It allows Thrawn to be emotionless, cold, and distant while at the same time understanding, sympathetic and relatable.

The paradox of Thrawn is his relationship to emotion. Chiss are calculated and guarded. Emotion is lesser than logic. So, it makes sense for Thrawn to be alienated by his own people despite being able to hide emotions. Thrawn is inherently tied to emotion. This is because art is emotion, even if the artist intentionally denies emotion, they must still contemplate emotions before making that choice.

Emotions are primal and inescapable; they are woven into our every fiber. The Chiss Ascendancy chooses to deny emotion; not feeling emotions, but rather expressing emotions. As a result, art is not highly valued because it is tied to emotional expression. By valuing art, Thrawn is more accepting of emotion. Zahn captures this perfectly in the situations that involve Thrawn‚Äôs failure to explain his strategy using words and logic. Instead Thrawn says that he can picture it, that it is a ‚Äúfeeling,‚Äù which others see as going with his gut.

By opening himself to art, Thrawn is connecting, almost empathizing with others, and as a result Thrawn proves to be a more effective military officer than his emotion-dismissing peers. This is what makes Thrawn such a fitting character for Star Wars. He is a distortion of the truth we learn from the trilogies that emotion is powerful, and that balance is key to success.

What ultimately makes Thrawn a villain is his inability to fully empathize. Thrawn never sees himself in others‚Äô shoes, he only perceives their logic and always considers them assets.",StarWars,ListenMrJudge,False,/r/StarWars/comments/ip38u5/thrawn_is_the_most_emotional_chiss_thrawn/

Only three things to come out of Disney owning Star Wars which is Rebels, Galaxy‚Äôs Edge, and the Mandolorian. I also think Disney wanted to make more money too. And despite the movies not being good I do really like Daisy Ridley in The Force Awakens, and John Boyega in all the films I wish he got more of a bigger role in the movies along with Oscar Issac as well the girl who played Phasma. 


The prequels deserve their own line. Growing up I never liked them but I really like Revenge Of The Sith dude it just everything.

58,What is the next step for Star Wars television. I'll tell ya:,1599593821,"Clone Wars is over, Rebels is probably over but that might change, and now the bad-I mean sequel trilogy is over... so what now. In my eyes there are only two paths for a Star Wars animated series in the same league of Clone Wars could go...

1. They can go to after the Sequel Trilogy and create a new story coming off the heels of the vague and disappointing ending of the Rise of Skywalker: Being honest, I can imagine great things for the future of Star Wars. I have in fact made my pitch for a Star Wars TV show in the past on this very Reddit as well as created characters for it. However, this is far more risky than option 2.
2.  A TV show taking place between Return of the Jedi and The Force Awakens... Kylo Ren was honestly the most interesting part of the Sequel Trilogy, and his acting as well as delivery outshined every other actor (Except Snoke). So why not have his story play out on screen along side so many other new characters as well as Sequel Trilogy originals... maybe even the guy Finn was cloned from. There are honestly so many ways to go with this... and we may actually be able to mildly redeem the Sequel Trilogy with this story. We would have ample time to show the slow fall from grace Luke endures as well as witness Ben's relationships with his family. We can show the slow rise of the First Order and even possibly explain Palpetine still being alive. All from one perspective... all with one span of time. If we're really going to have a sequel trilogy... lets use it for something good! (If it is possible please send this to Dave Filoni as a simple idea. I'd rather stay off twitter.)",StarWars,soup100,False,/r/StarWars/comments/ip0gvl/what_is_the_next_step_for_star_wars_television/

87,Does anyone else with an overactive imagination harbor profound emotional effects that Star Wars had on you as a child?,1599555822,"This is a deviation from posts about amazing cosplay and art pieces, but I'm kind of alone in my love for Star Wars amongst my friends, not to mention more emotionally attuned than most guys my age (26) so I don't really have anywhere to share this phenomenon where it is meaningful.  It's a long read, but something I've been sincerely harboring my whole adult life so I'd be grateful for some discussion.

I was 5 when Phantom Menace came out, and 11 when RotS was released, my imagination was absolutely wild for Star Wars.  My little brain was ripe for the harvest.  I lived a bleak and boring suburban life, and SW gave me a glimpse into an unreachable universe where people's deeds seemed to matter.  I STILL remember the soul-deep melancholy when Order 66 was executed (I thought the Old Republic society and technology was so utopian and exciting, and hated seeing it crumble) I remember feeling nihilism for the first time when Obi-Wan and Yoda returned to the temple after the 501st purged it.  

Today, in a video I heard a clip of [Anakin's Dark Deeds](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=vAM80pXTjYQ) and I was immediately melancholic. I was ripped from reality and transported back to that moment I first heard that song in 2005.  I remember my eyes getting moist when I heard the Star Wars theme rendition in the final [Rise of Skywalker trailer](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaQEn_XTPY).  I get ripped into these deep FOMO moments, where life feels very mundane.  Does this happen to anyone else?

I often wonder the source  (I'm also a psych major so that makes this fun).  Sometimes I think the tragedy of Anakin was too powerful for my 11 year old mind, maybe it was just too much conflict and flashing lights lol.  I remember crying for hours after leaving the theater in 2005 because ""Anakin was just so sad"" and I couldn't handle how tormented he had to have been to do what he did.  My parents did NOT understand.

Does anyone know how many Venators are in the Republic Navy?,1599515994,"According to wookiepedia and that magazine, Sifo Dyas asked for 3,000,000 clones to be made. But also according to wookiepedia there were 20 sector armies and each sector army consisted of 147,456 clones. Also according to wookiepedia each sector army had it's own sector fleet. I do not know how many Venators there are so I'm missing that piece. But each Venator class star destroyer has 7,400 clones in the crew. So multiply the amount of venators by 7,400 then subract the total of Republic Navy personnel from 3,000,000, then subract 10,000 special ops Clones from that total, than you will find the exact number of Clones who was in the Grand Army of the Republid. Not the Republic Navy, the Army. and then hopefully a Legion doesn't actually have 9,216 clones or else there would only be a maximum of 283 legions that you can carve out of the total number of Clones that were made, and that wouldn't necessarily make sense since we know the 501st Legion exists.

Title. It hits all the tropes of a detective/spy film. Obi-Wan is tracking down an assassin and uncovering a secret conspiracy. A few scenes in particular sell it completely. When he goes to Dex looking for clues is a scene straight out of a 40's set noir. A lot of the scenes on Kamino follow a very noir style pattern of picking up clues. Then on Geonosis Obi-Wan listens in on the secret cabal of industrialists leading the separatist alliance. Even disregarding the fact that Count Dukoo is even played by a former Bond villain, this round table of the banking clan, the trade federation, the techno union, etc. looks a lot like a Spectre meeting. Then of course there is the part where Obi-Wan is captured and tortured while the bad guy explains his evil plot. Then he goes and grabs the plans for the planet destroying evil laser beam he's developing (death star).

47,Question regarding Star Wars lore,1599498086,"Hello,

I had a thought the other day whilst listening to Jay Exci's review of TROS. In that movie they go to like 6 or 7 different planets if not more and each and every planet they never need a space suit or breathing apparatus or anything of that nature its basically like a different version of earth.

Then I came to think about the few other star wars movies I saw and I don't think I've ever seen anyone need some sort of protection or breathing tank like ever. Unless you count the flight suits they sometimes wear in the X-wings or Y-wings. And IDK if the storm troopers wear those armors because its their uniform or for protection. And if they wear it for protection why are they the only ones who do?

Here's my question is there an explanation of this in the lore? or is it a ""We just don't talk about that"" type of thing?",StarWars,xXDREDNAWTXx,False,/r/StarWars/comments/iobb0j/question_regarding_star_wars_lore/

The following was interesting:

1- I never get bored myself watching. And it was beautiful to watch all movies in sequence for first time. Dopamine after dopamine .. I was satisfied!

2- My lady is not into sci-fi. It was exciting to see her classification to Starwars as good and evil thriller. Despite the core story is in fact absolute out of this world..

3- She did not flench for the difference between part 3 and part 4. Where you  watch a movie made in seventies as a second part of a movie that was made recently.

4- I noted how robots and droids became worn out in the second trilogy including Darth Vedar mask itself. These guys been through a lot.

5- For first time in my life I feel fundamental things do not go along. I just tolerated before for the love of the Starwars world.  

6- It was amazing to see that everything robots visual design was coming from Starworld. The creators were able to influence movies till the very today. Watch WallE movie; most robots in the movie already are coming from Starworld.

However that is not what we saw in The Last Jedi. Luke lost Ben to the dark side when he almost killed him. Thus he was doing something that went counter to the Jedi Way.  The first order grew because he did nothing, once more something counter to the Jedi Way.  

This is what should have happened. 

Luke should have saw the evil in Kylo , and Kylo could have even done some horrible stuff, but Luke still saw good in him. And then without warning Kylo does something horrible. This would have kept Luke True to his character (of the ones who think he wasn't) and supported Luke conclusion that the Jedi way was bad. Given him a reason to stay one the island way from everyone, since he blamed the Jedi way for what happened. what  we have now is a guy who almost feel to the dark side, and that pushed his ward to go full to the darkside.

Obviously he never wanted that from Dooku, as it's clear he was just a stand-in from the start, but did he want that from Maul, his original apprentice, and then later Vader?

Since he told Yoda rather proudly that Vader would grow more powerful than the both of them, I'm guessing that when he found Anakin, he thought he would be the heir to the Sith and take his place one day, but when Anakin was defeated by Obi-Wan and confined to the suit, Sidious was disappointed and hoped to one day find someone even ,or formidable, and when he learned of Luke, he was hoping that Luke would instead fill that role.

That's what I gather, but I've also heard it said that Sidious had started his own Sith Rule of One or so,ethical and planned to be the Sith Lord forever. Can anyone give me clarity on this? I've seem/read most of the canon Expanded Universe, but haven't read much Legends, is it ever stated what Sidious's intentions regarding his apprentices were?

86,What do you think a mind flayer is?,1599431644,"Was rewatching The Mandalorian and this was a little piece of dialogue that caught my interest that there is no canon answer to, but it's fun to speculate. I've seen a lot of people suggest it's the tentacled creature in that really unecessary hentai scene in Rogue One, but this theory doesn't really satisfy me, it seems boringly obvious and I'd rather that creature was just forgotten about tbh.

Considering the specific word choice of ""uploading"" to a mind flayer it made me think this was some sort of technology, some form of computer or machine. We've seen characters in Star Wars with machine implants or attachments on their heads, like Lobot. Apparently Lobot's head gear had the risk of effecting his mind, erasing his personality and causing mental instability, so maybe with some sinister alterations a piece of tech like this could be turned from a utility to a torture device. Perhaps being uploaded to a mind flayer literally means being attatched to a cybernetic device that the mind is uploaded to and then systematically torn apart or ""flayed"", maybe to access information or simply to cause pain and even sentence the Empire's enemies to fatal destruction of the mind.

Considering the Empire's focus on technology and advancing it for terrible means I feel like some kind of computerised torture device/mind breaker is a lot more sinister and potentially interesting than the more obvious gross tentacle monster. I think a piece of device like this existing in SW would raise some interesting questions about what technology in the galaxy is really capable of.",StarWars,Undead_Corsair,False,/r/StarWars/comments/invjlf/what_do_you_think_a_mind_flayer_is/

Liked it‚Äôs story more than the new sequels.,1599431188,"Seriously there is so many awesome stories and lore about the force as an entity, the spiritual side of it and it‚Äôs history. It is such a huge factor. Fallen Order made me care about the characters that were involved. I would say it‚Äôs story is better than the new sequels. 

I‚Äôm not complaint but I though if a few cool things that would have been cool in the game to see. 

1. Involving Darth Mail in the Dathomir story even if it was in a very small way. 
2. Having some kind of interaction between Cal and Merrin mentioning that he killed the Gorgara. 
3. When he comes out of the tomb on Bogano after Trilla takes the holocron, theres a huge group of troopers waiting for him, and just when he thinks he‚Äôs in trouble and preparing to try and fight them all, the Binog attacks the troopers. 
4. Maybe an after credits scene of them on Kashyyyk of Cal introducing Merrin to the Shyyyo bird maybe hinting at a little something between them.

92,Is it possible the Rey could end up being the actual first gREY Jedi?,1599428058,"Puns aside I was thinking about this, and apologizes to any EU people who know if there have been any actual previously confirmed Grey Jedi (I feel Qui Gon in practice was pretty solidly in the Light camp).

So all Jedi seem to retire to starting temples and Rey definitely has some work ahead of her.  She has affinity with both light and dark, (although she does see the consequences of things like Force Lightning) and understands the force must be kept in balance.

The issue is, in the end she's kinda the only one left.  She is empowered by all of the Jedi (and I believe avoided absorbing all of the Sith), but is the only individual who can really rebuild any teachings on the Force (unless force ghosts help?).  I cannot see her rebuilding the Sith, but if only a new Jedi temple is founded then the Force will be fundamentally unbalanced.

My thought is this, If you can only found one school of thought from which all future Force sensitive people will be taught (since we don't have any more Sacred Texts) would it be more sound to found the Grey Jedi? My reasons are:

1. Rey has used both Light and Dark sides of the force and at least understands both and their duality.
2. Rey has grown up in a world shaped by Powerful Light and Powerful Dark: she grew up in ruins from the inevitable conflicts between pure light and dark.
3. Balance can be achieved by 2 equal and opposite sides (Jedi and Sith) or 1 central pillar (the Grey Jedi).
4. Rey has seen first hand both corruption and redemption (or I could say 'turn' 30 times) and knows people can be changed.
5. She only has herself and her mentors: I am unsure why anyone would found two opposing temples.

97,"Which character, in your opinion, best represented what the Jedi should be?",1599426016,"To me, Kanan Jarrus was the one who really embodied what the Jedi should have been. He was by no means perfect, was a little too impulsive at times, and clearly struggled with the role of being a master from time to time, but even in his darkest hours, he put his trust in the force and stood to help those in need. While the Jedi Order constantly taught that attachments were forbidden and something to fear because they could lead to the dark side, Kanan embraced his friends and allies and always put them first. He drew strength from the bonds he formed with Hera, Ezra, and the rest of the Ghost Crew, and he never hesitated to choose them over a mission. The attachments he had to them didn‚Äôt create fear and suffering, but rather they gave him the strength to always choose what was right and to become a better Jedi to protect them.

Personally, I think Kanan was a Jedi with one of the greatest connections to the force because of his inner strength and resolve that came from the love of his family (the Ghost Crew). When he faced arguably his hardest moment, being blinded by Maul, it was his care for his family that drove him to see things differently and trust more in the force so that he could still be there for them. When their lives were in danger, he didn‚Äôt hesitate to sacrifice himself to make sure his family lived - something that the force rewarded him for by giving him his sight back in his final moments (which made him keep his promise to Hera). And even beyond the love of his family, he had a deep personal connection with the force too. Heck he was knighted by the force itself!  Even though he had moments of losing his way, whenever Kanan put his trust in the force, it felt like his connection to it grew immensely, and by the time he died, it really felt like there was no Jedi with a closer connection to the force than he had.

Kanan was wise and grew into a good leader, just like the Jedi Order would want a master to be, but he was also passionate and let his personal feelings guide his decisions instead of fearing them. He brought the best of what the Jedi Order could be and the best of what they taught against and was a true Jedi right up until his death, and that‚Äôs why I feel like Kanan was the one who represented the best of what the Jedi should have been.

4,How media brainwashes people about Lucas's writing,1599419390,"**1. Deception**

Corrupt journalists like to tell lies: ‚ÄúLucas didn't write Empire‚Äù or ‚ÄúEmpire is great because of Kasdan‚Äù. For example, [this article](https://www.vulture.com/2017/10/100-greatest-screenwriters-of-all-time-ranked.html) contains [this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLZQfnFyelTBOQ15kmHSgEbdjzLMWzZpL7&amp;v=oJUnXdoqDk4) In it, Yoda's quote ""Do or do not"" (2.35) is declared as Leigh Brackett's quote. Her script is [available](https://screenplaysandscripts.com/script_files/S/STAR%20WARS%20-%20EP%20V%20%20%20-%20THE%20EMPIRE%20STRIKES%20BACK%20(1980)%20Leigh%20Brackett%20[scan].pdf) in the Internet and doesn't contain this phrase.

Vader's quote ""I am your father"" is declared (9.07) as Kasdan's quote, though it is a [Lucas's quote.](https://imgur.com/a/lIJUhBA) Kasdan's screenplays are also [available](http://screenplaysandscripts.com/script_files/S/STAR%20WARS%20-%20EP%20V%20%20%20-%20THE%20EMPIRE%20STRIKES%20BACK%20%281980%29%20Leigh%20Brackett%20and%20Lawrence%20Kasdan%20%5B1979-2-20%5D%20%5B5th%5D.pdf) and don't contain this phrase. (page 147)

At all, in this article Lucas isn't even considered as a writer even of the ‚ÄúReturn of the Jedi‚Äù, though he is declared in the script. Professional screenwriters, who put him in the 16th place, know that he is a writer of the whole OT, but stupid journalist doesn't. By the way, Ford [said](https://www.looper.com/207276/the-untold-truth-of-harrison-ford/) about his dialogues in ANH: ‚ÄúI was wrong. It worked.‚Äù

Brian Jones in his ‚ÄúGeorge Lucas: A Life‚Äù also tells lies, when he writes ‚ÄúStar Wars script is dated 15 May‚Äù (chapter 11). It is not a mistake: in the chapter 7 he writes that the script wasn't finished before the first day of filming (22 March 1976). But really Star Wars [script](http://screenplaysandscripts.com/script_files/S/STAR%20WARS%20-%20EP%20IV%20-%20A%20NEW%20HOPE%20%281977%29%20George%20Lucas%20%5B1976-03-15%5D%5B4th%5D.pdf) is dated 15 March, not 15 May, and it was finished a week before the first day of filming.

**2. Misconceptions**

The other stupid myth about Lucas is: ‚ÄúDialogues in A New Hope weren't bad because they were written by Carrie Fisher (or Gloria Katz, Willard Huyck, Howard the Duck, donkey from Shrek)‚Äù. Actually Katz and Huyck were script doctors of ‚ÄúA New Hope‚Äù, but no more. They only changed a few phrases (and Lucas's changes were much more - compare the script and the movie). Also he often enhanced his dialogues on the set, like [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/b9ie3e/the_original_leia_hologram_speech_complete_with/)

Script doctoring is not screenwriting. Dialogue editing is not screenwriting. For example, ‚ÄúPredator‚Äù doesn't contain the most important dialogue of the movie. Does it mean that Jim Thomas and John Thomas cannot write? No, it doesn't. Even when Lucas wrote only a story for ‚ÄúRaiders‚Äù, he was [nominated](https://www.wga.org/writers-room/101-best-lists/101-greatest-screenplays/list) for the Writers' Guild Award, because he still was the main writer. Coppola almost didn't write The Godfather. ‚ÄúPatton‚Äù and ‚ÄúApocalypse Now‚Äù were co-written by other writers. Someone says that he cannot write?

The most common myth about Lucas is his ‚Äúwooden‚Äù dialogues. Of course, nobody reads about [technical rules of dialogue writing](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/6-essential-screenwriting-tips-for-writing-better-movie-dialogue/) or about [basic mistakes.](https://writersrelief.com/2015/05/07/dialogue-technique-dos-donts/). But even one of the first dialogues is technical: ‚ÄúThese Federation types are cowards. The negotiations will be short.‚Äù This dialogue would be wooden, if Lucas wrote ‚ÄúI think the negotiations will be short.‚Äù It is the third rule - **use an outsider for exposition**. Also, Lucas uses the subtext (fourth rule): ‚ÄúThe queen will not approve.‚Äù - ‚ÄúQueen doesn't need to know.‚Äù - ‚ÄúWell, I don't approve.‚Äù

One of the most important techniques is **unique voices**. This technique is realized (for example, in TPM) with great skill, not worse that in Tarantino's ‚ÄúKill Bill‚Äù. For example, the Bride's voice is sharp as a knife: ‚ÄúI would have to kill you, go into Nikki's room, kill her, than wait for your old man, Dr. Bell, to come home and kill him.‚Äù Vernita panics: she is foul-mouthed.

Lucas's unique voices in TPM are great: Qui-Gon is very kind and acts like a father to Padme, Obi-Wan, Jar Jar Binks and Anakin (""Your mother's right."" ‚ÄúThe ability to speak does not make you intelligent.‚Äù ‚ÄúDon't touch anything.‚Äù) Padme is young and naive (this her unique trait is literally mentioned by Palpatine): ‚ÄúI can't believe there's still slavery in the galaxy.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou're gungan, aren't you?‚Äù. Anakin's unique trait is youthful maximalism: ‚ÄúI can help. I can fix anything.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo one can kill a Jedi.‚Äù ‚ÄúAre you an angel?‚Äù (just like Hatfield in ‚ÄúStagecoach‚Äù: ‚ÄúYou don't understand, cowboy. You've never seen an angel. Or a gentlewoman."") Even Panaka is memorable, because he is an extremely tough person: ‚ÄúI think you can kiss your trade franchise good bye.‚Äù After that, someone will say that Lucas cannot write dialogues? Are you out of your mind?

‚ÄúLet me prove you're wrong! I don't like sand!‚Äù - will be an answer. ‚ÄúI don't like sand‚Äù is a technical dialogue even without the sandstorm and without cleaning details (sand, yes - it gets everywhere) from the Episode I, because it follows Padme's phrase: ‚ÄúWe used to lie on the sand...‚Äù By the way, this phrase is based on Lucas's biography: the sand was his annoying problem during shooting Star Wars in 1976. But corrupt journalists and bloggers like to say that black is white and repeat that 100 000 times, or the propaganda doesn't work.

**3. Reviews of idiots**

The most common of them is Plinkett's reviews, which ‚Äúprove that the prequels are objectively bad‚Äù. Actually, these reviews are objectively bad. For example, he says: ‚ÄúObi-Wan and Qui-Gon should be one character.‚Äù Doesn't he realize that it will kill the whole story, because Qui-Gon has enough authority in Anakin's eyes, but dies? Obi-Wan is too young to be a master, that's why Anakin's betrayal looks very realistic. Also, Obi-Wan didn't save Anakin from the slavery - Qui-Gon did. I already wrote about the ‚Äúflat‚Äù characters, but here's another proof that they have good character development. There is such a concept in the screenwriting technique like [falling action.](https://literarydevices.net/falling-action/) In ANH it is a Death Star assault, in TPM - battle of Naboo. Who initiates the whole falling action in the Episode I and III? Padme. She makes decisions, which affect the whole plot. (By the way, compare it with Leia.) Not to mention deliberate lies like ""midichlorians aren't mentioned in the next movies"" (they are mentioned in III in the key scene).

Chris Stuckmann's reviews are also stupid - for example, his pod race critique that all shots are left to right (all shots from ANH Trench Run or Terminator 2 canal chase are right to left, but who cares). It was dismantled by Rick Worley in his video about Dunning-Kruger effect. But Stuckmann himself is a filmmaker. He knows 180-degree rule. It means that he just deliberately lies. Honest Trailers in the Episode III complain that Obi-Wan in IV is too old, though Guinness was 62, that Leia remembers her mother (in the Episode VI Obi-Wan said: ‚Äúyou were hidden from your father, when you were born‚Äù, so it doesn't contradict anything)... etc.

**4. Gaslighting**

Even worse that RedLetterMedia or StarWarsOnly declare people who love these movies as unadequate persons, or, for example, Stuckmann and Nostalgia Critic say that they are a loud minority. No, guys.

22,Lore and species questions for SW RPG,1599406652,"So my brothers are getting into D&amp;D and they both love Star Wars (one read every legends book), so I thought I‚Äôd start a campaign with Star Wars stuff! But I‚Äôm not a huge lore knowledge bank, so I thought I‚Äôd come here for questions if that‚Äôs okay?

So for starters for my campaign, I have three questions:

1) how does the timeline work? Like for us it‚Äôs BC and AD, but how does it work in SW? Because I want an era before Skywalker (I‚Äôm using cannon and legends in my campaign to keep it more versatile), but still where force users are available almost anywhere, light, dark, or grey.

2) what is the personality of a Hutt? Are they more ‚Äúhey you did good, but now you die‚Äù or ‚Äúhey you did good, how about another job? Move up in the ranks of my Hutt empire‚Äù? My campaign will start with them doing a job for a Hutt after getting in trouble with them. He said he will free them if they get a package, but he will either attempt to kill them or give them more work (depending on how my brothers roll). I want options, but I don‚Äôt want to break from the personality of the species.

3) how likely is dormant force powers? I want one of the characters in my campaign to have force powers but not know it. He will be persuasive (subtle force mind trick to influence people unintentionally) and a very good shot (the force kinda guides his hand and he ‚Äúnever misses‚Äù).

Luke and Leia would‚Äôve thought it‚Äôs really weird that that have EXACTLY the same birthday just two days after Empire Day.

This would‚Äôve been an issue unless they just don‚Äôt pay attention to birthdays and dates of birth.

You could argue that Luke and Leia never had birth certificates because they were being hidden from the Emperor, which does make sense and I‚Äôd agree.

54,I'm convinced Disney ruined the sequels on purpose.,1599366594,"I love Star Wars and everything Star Wars. I've seen all of the movies dozens of times (prequels are just as good as the original), watched the Clone Wars, Rebels, The Mando, hell I've even seen the Christmas special as painful as it is to watch, but the sequels are something else. 

In the past, the only thing that Disney ruined were their child actors. That changed when they bought Star Wars.

The more I watch the sequels and see breakdowns of all of the mistakes made, the more convinced I am. So many of the character arcs were waisted, I'm talkin to you Finn and Rose. Lightsabers were weak pool noodles. Rey was infallible, Kylo was... well Kylo. I could go into much greater detail, but most of it speaks for itself.

Disney wanted to desperately get away from the Skywalker story. It was becoming the center of this GIANT universe that GL created, and it was causing diminishing returns.

There is so many intricate character arcs, cultures, complexities and themes within the Star Wars Universe that was being overshadowed by the Skywalker Saga. This greatly diminished their ability to tell other stories outside of that Saga. 

Disney pretty much did what Game of Thrones did to their fanbase, they butchered the ending so bad that nobody cares about that story anymore. Nobody wants to remember it. It's like a bad breakup, but with every bad breakup comes something new a better, and that's what Disney was lining us up for.

Rogue One, Solo, The Mando and the latest season of Clone Wars supports my idea. They were all AWESOME and great Star Wars experiences that had very little to do with the Skywalker Saga. The universe has been built, and it's going to be used as a tool to create even better stories that will weave into the greater picture of the SWU as a whole.

TLDR: Disney committed seppuku with the Skywalker Saga so they could tell more stories in the Star Wars Universe outside of the Skywalker Saga.

I was rewatching The Mandalorian and when I saw the Child, I started to think again about the mysterious race and what little was known about them. I thought of Yoda and Yaddle, too. Why were they so special, and why did the remnants of the Empire want the Child so badly? What sort of experiments and tests could they be performing on it? Why would they pay as much as they did for the Child?

I noticed pretty soon that the Child seemed to be practicing the Force on their own, with no teacher there to show them how it‚Äôs done. So I thought, maybe this is why their race is so special? Does the Force come naturally to them? Are they the ones who teach others to use the force, and do not need to be taught by others how to use it? 

I tend to overthink things a lot so if by any means it seems like I am just say so. But if you agree, feel free to add any points I missed to support this idea! If you disagree, let me know why! If you read through this, regardless of whether you agree with it or not, I thank you.
