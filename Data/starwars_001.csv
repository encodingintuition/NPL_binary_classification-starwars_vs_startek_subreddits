10,Why Ben Solo/Kylo Ren is the strongest Force User IMHO,1601329405,"&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xpxvt7dijyp51.jpg?width=1194&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea816b1d213a67169ade7b0e8f36e66fd38f7acb

Here are some reasons why I think Ben Solo/Kylo Ren is the strongest Force user we’ve ever seen on screen. Of course, this is all very subjective and I’m sure many will disagree, but this is my opinion and I hope you enjoy my breakdown. 

First of all, two of the most powerful force users in the ST say this about him:

Luke Skywalker: *""I've seen this raw strength only once before in Ben Solo. It didn't scare me enough then. It does now.""* 

Supreme Leader Snoke: *""When I found you, I saw raw, untamed power, and beyond that, something truly special.""* 

Also let’s think about the force powers Ben/Kylo displays in the films:

\-In TFA he stops a blaster bolt in mid-air and holds it for over a minute. We’ve never seen a force user do this and it’s something we never see a force user do again. This is one of the most impressive force powers I’ve ever seen in any Star Wars film, hands down. 

\-In TLJ he is able to mask his true intentions in the force from a being as strong as Snoke, when he turns and ignites the Skywalker saber, killing his master. This is something Luke couldn't even do aboard the DS2 with his lightsaber right beside Palpatine. Also by killing his dark side master, he did something Darth Vader couldn’t even do. 

\-In TROS he is the only force user we ever see to completely bring someone back to life (Rey). Her body was lifeless on Exegol which isn't the same as when she healed his wound on Kef Bir. This ability could've been attributed to the Dyad, but it's worth pointing out, nonetheless. It’s also an ability his grandfather Anakin would have been envious of when trying to save his wife Padme. 

\-In TROS he somehow survives being thrown down (what looks like) a bottomless pit by the most powerful Sith Lord ever. We don’t see on screen how he is able to get back up, but my guess would be he used some type of force levitation to keep himself from falling to his death (which was something he accomplished when training with Snoke in the “Age of Resistance: Snoke” comic book) .  

\-In TROS he is also the first to rise against a rejuvenated Palpatine after both he and Rey’s life forces were drained.

I think these are all worthy points as to why Ben Solo/Kylo Ren is the most powerful force user in the Skywalker Saga. He may not be the flashiest fighter (like Anakin), but the abilities he displays are second to none and completely unique to him and for that I give him the edge over his grandfather.",StarWars,skywalkinondeezhatrz,False,/r/StarWars/comments/j1lne7/why_ben_solokylo_ren_is_the_strongest_force_user/

37,My theory about how Anakin fulfilled the Chosen One prophecy.,1601322777,"So Lucas himself stated that Anakin was the chosen one and the Chosen One prophecy is true.   But I was never satisfied by the answer to this being Anakin fulfilled the prophecy by saving his son and causing the destruction of the Galactic Empire.  I mean the Sith rise again in the sequel trilogy and also does destroying the dark side really bring balance to the force?  Lucas has stated that both sides of the Force are important.  Here's my head canon on how Anakin brings balance to the Force.

In the prequel trilogy, the prophecy describes the coming of a Chosen One who would destroy the Sith and bring balance to the Force that way.  But Yoda states that the prophecy was misinterpreted by the Jedi.  In fact, Lucas himself has stated the same thing.  I believe the prophecy really means the Chosen One would destroy both the Sith and the Jedi and bring balance to the force that way.

Here's why I believe this.  So Anakin destroys the original Jedi Order and then later Anakin and Luke destroy the Galactic Empire.  Then in the sequel trilogy Kylo Ren destroys the second Jedi Order Luke creates and finally Kylo Ren and Rey destroy the Final Order.  So each of the Jedi and Sith orders (both new and old) are destroyed by Skywalkers. 

Finally, I believe the Jedi truly end with Rey as she is ""the last jedi"", or so as the movie is named.  So after Kylo Ren and Rey defeat Palpatine, both the Sith and the Jedi have been destroyed for the last time.  Thus the prophecy of the Chosen One has been completed and the Skywalkers return to the Force.  And that's why you see Kylo and Leia's bodies disappear at the end of the movie.",StarWars,NoRiceForP,False,/r/StarWars/comments/j1jg06/my_theory_about_how_anakin_fulfilled_the_chosen/

56,Searching for People to help continue Post-Launch-Support for my Star Wars Battlefront Scratch Game,1601316571," TL;DR I made a Star Wars Battlefront Game that I want to give Updates to, but I don't have enough time, so I need your help.

Hi, it's Badbrix / Lennard\_Gaming (Scratch).

I released my Star Wars Battlefront Game a Month ago. It had 3 Playmodes, 1 Map, 2 Factions, and I invested about 3 Weeks into the Project. It all started when I got to play Star Wars Battlefront 2 EA. I didn't play it often, but it stuck with me (I started after the Lootbox-deasater). I really liked the whole concept, the gameplay, the graphics, the maps, etc... When EA then shut down Support, after releasing some really good updates, I kind of got the Idea to make a Battlefront Game with Scratch. I only implemented 1 map at first, and got someone to playtest the Game. They thought it was really good. I then forgot about the Game, but found it a Month ago. I wanted to release the Game as soon as possible, to give people the oppertunity to play my game as soon as possible, with the intention of giving the game post launch support, to add more maps and expand the Idea to something truely great, what I think it could become. The Launch was really good, making it my most popular game yet, even beeing on #1 of trending ""battlefront"" games. ( [Star Wars Battlefront Scracth by me](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/424054321/) )

I then heard of the Anniversary of Star Wars V The Empire Strikes Back on Sep 25. So I got to work on adding the Planets of Hoth and Bespin. The most challenging Parts of the preproduction was to find map Layouts I was happy with. Then I spent several hours on making Hoth and Bespin, maing sure to add some Eastereggs such as making an Interrior for the Milenium Falcon and more. ( [Battlefront The Empire Strikes Back Season](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/429411209) )

Now, I want to work on even more content for the Game, with approximatly 2 more Updates launching this Year... The problem is, that I did the game during Lockdown and the Update during Summer Holidays. Now, I have classes, with Lessons till 4pm /16 o' clock, tests coming up and me not having that much free time. I still however want to support the Game and make new updates, it's just to stressfull and killing my nerves, because it's a project of passion. That's why I'm asking you, if you would be able or want to help me.

How could you help?

\-If you know someone who might / could help me with something, please inform them-

I am more of an artist then a programmer, but I will be doing most, if not all of the coding myself, as I am the person that understands my code the best. I know what and how I want to implement something. The only things that could potentionally be helpfull in the far future, (not for this Update,tho) would be if someone would look into my AI...

I need:

\-Map designers / searchers

Your Task:

It is very time expensive to look for map desings/ make them myself... I also am not very good at designing them, so if you could help me with that, it would save my life...

There is a special pattern to how maps are layed out, that I can explain, after we get in contact...

\-Vector Artist

Your Task:

I have several different Ways someone like you could help me:

\-Trooper Animation: The Animation you can see in your collection/spawn screen. I will expand on this with more Factions and might need help. They are based off of FUNUTs Star Wars Story Mode Sprites, but I will send you the newest Files if you would help me...

\-Maps: I use Image Tracing to make an vector version of the Map designs.

\-Loadingscreens / Main Menu Pictures: Pictures of the Planet / Cinematic Shots

\-Sounddesigner/Searcher

Your Task:

The Music and Background atmospheric sounds as well as voicelines &amp; Balster Sounds are needed for every map or new Faction. I usually search them up on the Internet, so it would help if you could find/make some good fitting sounds.

You will be mentioned in the credits as an Battlefront 2 Team member.

If you would or want to help, you can get in contact with me by sending me a message on

reddit or instagram ( [https://www.instagram.com/star\_wars\_clones\_official/](https://www.instagram.com/star_wars_clones_official/) ), where we can then discuss what you would do and how we will cooperate.

90,How did your first Mandalorian Monday go? And...what time did it start?,1601310448,"Did any of you get belts or some of the other Galaxy's Edge stuff that sold out quick? If so, what time did you start trying to get into the site?

I logged into Mandalorian Monday at about 7:15am PST. I guess I got my times screwed up. I thought I was early, but I'm guessing that it was pretty late in the game. I did check last night at about 3am, and there was nothing up at that point. 

I wanted to get my kids some Jedi costumes...they've been darn good kids throughout all this covid nonsense, even though we have to quarantine very seriously. And they play Star Wars *a lot*. So I figured...time beat up the old credit card and get them a treat.

Anyhow, by the time I got there, there were no belts or lightsaber holders left. I did get Jedi tunics and robes for both of them, and they'll definitely be happy about that (of course...I hope they fit. That's always a bit of a crapshoot with kids). I also got one of my boys the Rey tunic and armbands, because he has outgrown his old Rey costume. She's his favorite and that's the character he wants to be most of the time when they're playing.  

I will say...there wasn't a ton that appealed to me as an adult fan. But there are lots of Mando Mondays left, so I'm hoping there will be something that catches my eye. Getting up at whatever time the rest of you got up on Monday will be *tough* though. Whew. 

We can make the belts, etc. But...this time I just wanted to get them the official stuff because last time we were at Galaxy's Edge, about six months before the shutdown, they asked for the costumes as their souvenirs, and I said they were too expensive, which, yes they are...but I'm no good with sewing most of the time...so, whatever. Plus, if you tally up the fabric and leather and stuff you would need to make them, I think it's probably pretty close to the cost of these. 

I did tell them ""maybe someday"" when we were at Galaxy's Edge, figuring maybe I would do it the next time we went, which never happened because of world events. I always felt a little crummy about that, secretly. I have the old Museum Replicas tunic and robe, and it's way too big for them, but they like to play with it. Especially since I got them some decent stunt lightsabers that don't get all bashed up when they're smacking each other. When they were little, they didn't really like Star Wars. So...I'm trying to enjoy it now as much as I can, before the next thing takes over (although I secretly hope this phase lasts much longer and maybe never ends). 

\-Do any of you know someone who makes kids' Jedi and dark side belts (I got one of each for them). 

\-Do you think they'll release more Jedi belts next Mando Monday? 

\-What are the hot ticket items you're hoping to get your hands on?

\-How did your Mando Monday go? Did you get stuff? Or were you disappointed?

She also realized Anakin had fallen to the Dark Side when Obi Wan told her, and tried to pull a knife on him and stab him when they met on Mustafar.

29,The Skywalker Academy cast: (Fanmade),1601299640,"I have made the post explaining Skywalker Academy, but I'll explain each character.

Jake Rik: 

[Warrior in training, Jake Rik has been unknowingly using the Dark Side of the force to maintain his life his entire life. He uses the same technique that Darth Maul used to survive his wounds, only instead of using hate, he uses sheer willpower. Currently possesses no other force ability as well as no real control over the force beyond what he did by accident. Light saber Form 7](https://preview.redd.it/1u9cgq704wp51.png?width=1366&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=222f91d4ccec8f0770c1ec31bef7b8b9cdca837c)

Ereen Talatheen:

&amp;#x200B;

[Now a Jedi in training, Ereen Talatheen was born into slavery under the Hutts. She was bought by the teachers of Skywalker academy because of her exceptional force abilities and general skill. She's constantly on edge and is not within the mindset to make many friends yet, but she has a quest for knowledge near unparalleled by her peers. Often makes her history teachers nervous. Light saber form 4.](https://preview.redd.it/mjctv3x24wp51.png?width=1366&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b10f1343e2246fc02d44d21166e0c6c167df5f3)

Kyleen Skywalker:

&amp;#x200B;

[The decedent of Rey Skywalker, founder of Skywalker academy. She has trained her whole life to be at the top, to be the best of the best, to be the strongest, the fastest and the toughest among her peers. Any life outside of her training is unknown. Lighsaber form 3.](https://preview.redd.it/ql9667m54wp51.png?width=1366&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7fa03f089a66f94d2e7f731afb744f1290eb00c5)

Darth Hush:

&amp;#x200B;

[The Sith Assassin is a tricky foe, using her incredible skill to kill Jedi masters by the dozens. She prefers using her sniper rather than her light saber and only will engage in combat when necessary. She has invented a technique called the force cut, where she folds energy into a blade and swipes it in a wide arc. She is a Sith Pureblood, convinced by Darth Narcis to become his apprentice and personal assassin... however, she can't bring herself to hate the Jedi, no matter what they did so many years ago... She can't use force lighting, and she often questions if what she's doing is truly what she wants. Light saber form 2](https://preview.redd.it/ybdaprqa4wp51.png?width=1366&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46719297212fe2c284db08af39a47afc84394362)

Darth Narcis:

&amp;#x200B;

[The self entitled Sith Lord hated the Jedi almost from birth. He has always loved the idea of ruling the universe under his iron fist, and adores the work of the late Darth Sidious. The day he discovered his force sensitivity as well as just how powerful he really was, he decided to bring back the Sith Lords with him as their leader.

37,Clones in Canon,1601296221,"\*I'm about to discuss rumours people may consider spoilers for The Mandalorian Season 2\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So Temuera Morrison is rumoured to appear in The Mandalorian Season 2. Some people consider this a fact but until I see it confirmed by a Disney/LucasFilm rep or a member of the production, I still consider it a rumour. 

Anyhoo, my question to all you lovely fans is this; 

Was it ever confirmed in canon that the clone growth acceleration lasted the clones entire life time?  

I think from a production stand point it makes total sense to grow clones at a faster rate. However, it makes absolutely no sense to maintain that growth rate and effectively cut the life span of your soldiers in half.  

Isn't it entire possible, nay, probable that the clones growth was only accelerated until they reached full maturity?  The reason I ask is because I would much rather see Temuera play Rex than Boba Fett.  It wouldn't be difficult for the writers to go that way and thus would void any ""Temuera can't be playing Rex because he would be too old at this point"" arguments.

Ultimately, I'd love to see Temuera return to Star Wars in any role.  I'm just way more invested in Rex's story than I am in Boba Fetts.  It would also mean Rex could appear in any potential live action Ahsoka Tano show, but that's maybe just my wishful thinking.

Also, apologies if this has been posted before, this sub sees so much traffic that checking previous posts would take hours.

51,Something I noticed about Watto,1601288531,"So it had been a while since I watched the Prequel Trilogy, but the sheer quietness of my job these past few weeks led to me having time to watch both episode 1 and 2 in the same work shift. And there is something odd I noticed about Watto.

In Episode 1, he pratically laugh at the idea of a Jedi trying to use mind tricks on him (When Qui-Gon tried to mind-trick him into accepting the Republican credit). Watto told Qui-Gon that their mind trick don't work on him ''only money''

Then fast forward in Episode 2. Now, I understand that about 10 years have passed, since. But still, as soon as he saw a Jedi standing in front of him (before noticing it was Anakin) he suddenly started to be afraid, and told Anakin something like ''Whatever you heard about me, it ain't true''

That's odd IMO. I mean, it's not like the republic (and therefore the Jedi) had any real influance on Tatooine. Heck, in the Clone Wars movie, the republic actually had to ask Jabba the Hutt permission to fly around Tatooine for (IIRC) ration for troops. Obviously when Watto realised the Jedi standing in frony of him was Anakin, he was happy-ish (or maybe just releived to see it wasn't some random, unknown Jedi out to kill him) but what made him from laughing at Jedi to fearing them in the span of 10 years?",StarWars,PokeBattle_Fan,False,/r/StarWars/comments/j19h2w/something_i_noticed_about_watto/

66,Ok Ik basically 97% of y’all may disagree with me but hear me out,1601278998,"I personally loved Luke’s character in the last Jedi. It was something new and enjoyable to see progress. We got a Luke who was deeply heartbroken and destroyed over what he did and chose to disappear to not fuck anything else up. In most forms of media they always portrayed Luke as somewhat perfect. And I believe that’s what mostly caused the backlash and hate towards Luke’s character. But like I said I believe it was for the better we see Luke like this, so when he does become the hero in the end it feels rewarded. Luke in the film made a huge mistake, most people believe he came into bens room to kill him, which is entirely wrong. Luke came in to check been because he sensed some dark side in him. Which he was correct and reacted out of fear, even Luke realizes what he did was wrong immediately after igniting the saber. Luke sensed what his nephew would do a quick thought of ending him will stop what he would do, which was wrong which Luke actually knows it was but his instincts and fear got the better of him. A lot of people said, “Luke should’ve talked with Ben” even tho I do agree with that. He would’ve done it if Ben didn’t wake up I’m positive he would’ve but he didn’t and it led to everything. Some people called him a coward at the end of the film. Which I heavily disagree seeing as how he sacrificed his entire life to save the resistance. And he became the Luke of legend again. Dude straight up walked in front of the first order and stunted on kylo (who recently became their new supreme leader) in front of all of them. If that’s cowardly idk what’s brave to you. Luke became the hero again, a broken man who let his mistake drive him away. Ultimately sacrificing his life for hope aka the resistance, that’s beautiful right there my friends. I love Luke as a character. Love him from farm boy to galactic hero. But our heroes aren’t perfect, they’re gonna mess up a lot but as long as they step up and become heroes again and do the right thing that’s all that matters. Luke’s arc is amazing, showing us that our heroes will stumble and fall but they will rise up and be what we see them as. Y’all can hate me and call me stupid or not a real fan or whatever. But I stand by this arc cuz I see it was what Luke needed to be, yeah it did need some work but it was nailed fantastically.",StarWars,childishmarkeeloo,False,/r/StarWars/comments/j17t8e/ok_ik_basically_97_of_yall_may_disagree_with_me/

68,My Darth Bane Cast Choices,1601278261,"This has been brought up before, but I wanted to bring it back and make my own thread. I am very close to finishing this trilogy, but I am fairly new to reading star wars novels. I first read Master and Apprentice, and I am going to continue to read into the fantastic star wars universe in no particular order. So, please do expect more posts as I am falling in love with the franchise more and more every day.

I really hope we get a Darth Bane movie one day (yeah, in my dreams, I know) or even a trilogy. Here are my choices! I realize some roles are missing. Some of these were more difficult than others and I'm sure we all have different opinions, so let me know your choices. Most of these are rather big names, but oh well.

**Darth Bane**: Dave Bautista- This dude is 6 feet and 6 inches of steel. I've enjoyed his roles and he seems like the clear cut choice. Also, I believe he's even tweeted that he would accept this role.

Honorable mention: Dominic Purcell

**Darth Zannah:** Scarlett Johansson- Ok, maybe she's a little old, and maybe I'm just a Black Widow stan, but would she not be awesome twirling around that red double bladed saber?

Honorable mention: Eliza Taylor (younger choice who can definitely pull this role off if you frowned upon my choice of Scarlett)

**Set Harth**: Tom Hiddleston- A dark jedi with long silver hair, a bit of a trickster who flaunts and is full of wit and surprises... Loki is the guy.

**Zithany:** Megan Fox- This is a nice fit. Loved her in Transformers, I feel she would do well here. I think she could be very cunning. Zithany is a young former Jedi who joins the Sith academy. She is deceptive and takes a liking to Bane.

Honorable mention: Zendaya

**Kaan:** Joaquin Phoenix- Remember his excellent performance of the Joker? Can't you imagine this guy slowly losing his mind amidst a war, being manipulated and strung along by Bane into deploying the thought bomb? I can.

**Sirak:** Cameron Monaghan- This dude deserves to be on the Star Wars big screen. You may have heard his voice as Cal in Fallen Order. Add some Darth Maul horns, and he could rock this role.

**Hoth:** Sylvester Stallone- The brave leader of the Jedi army who sacrifices himself along with 100 men to the thought bomb. Maybe he's not the cleanest pick for the SW universe, but his army would definitely respect him. And, I see Stallone playing the Farfalla relationship dynamic well.

**Farfalla:** Brad Pitt- The long blonde haired Jedi, second in command to Hoth. Stallone/ Hoth thinks he's too flashy and political, but they get along in the end. Master to Johun. 

**Johun:** Colton Haynes- Apprentice to Farfalla. Misbehaves sometimes, but grows to be an honorable and knowledgable Jedi. Haynes plays a very strong sidekick to Green Arrow.

**Young Dessel/ young Bane (18 y/o):** Taylor Lautner- Strong, aggressive and wanting to prove himself. The world is against him and he has to stand up for himself. Lautner would do awesome here.

**Young Rain/ young Zannah:** Millie Bobbie Brown- I saw this choice somewhere else and it is perfect. If you've watched Stranger Things, I'm sure you can agree.

**Caleb the healer:** Russel Brand- Neutral and attuned to the force, strong-willed and a great father to Serra. Personally, I love Brand. He's an actor but also a youtube, author, and a guru of some sort.

**Serra:** Camila Mendes- Daughter to Caleb. At Caleb's command, she leaves home in anticipation of Bane's return. She later marries a prince but then becomes a widow. She is devastated as she learns of her father's death and seeks out revenge on Bane. 

**Lucia:** Lupita Nyong'o-  Serra's loyal bodyguard who used to be a soldier for the Sith. Lucia is a caring friend to Serra, but eventually recognizes Bane from their time served together during the war. She helps Bane escape from Serra's grip. Okay, I had not actually realized she played Maz before I did a google search. I think she could make a very strong Lucia. Her role in the Marvel films reminds me of this character.

**The Huntress:** Marie Avgeropoulos- The Lethan bounty hunter who poses a great threat to whoever crosses her. If you've seen the 100, you can have my back when I say Octavia was a bad\*\*\*. This chick is brutal.

71,Here’s somethings I have to say,1601277903,"I’m just gonna be here to point out some major flaws in the movies maybe sorta I’ll try.

The prequels it was mostly the writing and a bit of the acting, ofc the movie has some great acting (mostly from ewan) but yeah the writing and acting needed a bit more time in the oven. I still love them tho like I love all of Star Wars 


The og trilogy idk what is really wrong cuz it laid the foundation for Star Wars but what I can really say is, maybe too many people continue to look at these and question too much about Star Wars lore. Like the force for example it’s an unexplainable thing nobody truly knows it’s powers. The force can heal, make you fly, lift shit, etc. so when something “isn’t canon with the force” I believe that’s bs cuz I think anything can happen with the force. That really wasn’t anything wrong with the og but I just can’t find anything 


The sequels, I actually really like the sequels (hate me or call me an idiot all you want you’re the one coming off as a dick) but the sequels have a huge story problem, it’s hella inconsistent and doesn’t follow a plan. I don’t believe it’s Disney not knowing what their doing but Disney trying their best to tell a story while keeping fans and new people happy. Constant plot holes and retcons really messed it up when the force awakens did some good setting it up. I like the last Jedi a lot it being my favorite one and all but that film does have is problems and it’s backlash I believe caused the fuck up of the rise of skywalker. But the lack of use for its characters and the actually really poor story planning really messed up the sequels.



Overall Star Wars is Star Wars something for everyone to enjoy. They all have mistakes and none are really perfect. Hell George didn’t have a plan till empire dropped so nothing is really perfect. And that’s what made me enjoy Star Wars a lot more. They have their fuck ups but we always find love in them sometime soon, hell look at the prequels, rebels, resistance, empire(yeah that movie had some bad rep back then), etc.",StarWars,childishmarkeeloo,False,/r/StarWars/comments/j17m8g/heres_somethings_i_have_to_say/

Or the separatist attacked and tried to retake Onderon towards the end of the war. After maul takes over death watch Bo-katan takes her forces to help liberate places under control of the separatists and also to hopefully recruit some foundlings along the way. this next part is pure speculation and theres no evidence behind it. My prediction is that in season 2 of mando we are gonna learn that later on after the fall of the empire Moff Gideon attacks the Mandalorians and either kills Bo-Katan or she escapes with Sabine and fakes her death and then she or possibly a daughter she may have had between the end of rebels and the Mandalorian or sabine becomes the armorer.,StarWars,bdking1997,False,/r/StarWars/comments/j15eyh/is_din_djarin_from_onderon/

26,EA (Or whoever ends up with the Star Wars video game license) should make an open world Bounty Hunter game,1601235701,"EA has announced they're doubling down on Star Wars games, which could mean more Fallen Order, a Battlefront 3, or a Squadrons follow up. But, the best game EA could make is an open world bounty hunter game with a plotline, similar to Assassins Creed Odyssey, Grand Theft Auto or Red Dead Redemption 2.

First, it's an interesting, mostly unexplored topic. We've had spinoff comics or books about bounty hunters, but nothing major, and most the of the world they live in (how the guilds work, various rival syndicates, etc.) has been left unexplored. The closest we've gotten is the Mandalorian, which shows how interested people are in a topic like this. Jedi and Sith will always be awesome, but it's also nice to get away from the Force for a bit, and branch out into some new stories.

Second, the basic mechanics (while not easy) should be fairly simple: EA has made dozens of other shooter games. The Fallen Order developers talked about how it was difficult to incorporate lightsabers and the force, having them feel realistic while also not being OP. Since the basic mechanics are easy, that gives them way more time to work on the world itself, and other gameplay.

Third, the wide variety of the bounty hunter's world is perfect for a video game. It allows for people to see different corners of the galaxy, when movies or books can only do so much. This way, people could explore Coruscant or Bespin at their own speed, interacting with the cities. 

As to what exactly the game would include: A setting shortly after the fall of the Republic seems perfect. The CIS has collapsed, the Empire is seizing power, and chaos is everywhere. We've seen from other media that it took Palpatine several years to fully cement control over the galaxy, and that multiple criminal syndicates tried to make power grabs during that time. Players would be able to choose to work for different factions, each with it's own perks and area of influence (Hutts might offer more credits, but Imperial contracts would offer legitimacy and decrease criminal status, etc.). A morality system, similar to RDR2 could be used as well: Players could choose between doing whatever paid most, no matter the cost, or trying to defend the innocent, or somewhere in between. As for the gameplay itself, it would focus on versatility and choice: Do you want to go for a stealth route, hitting your target with a sniper rifle from a tower? Or use heavy armor and weapons, and take them and their bodyguards headon. People could use the rewards from their jobs to alter their armor, weapons, ship, etc.

Finally, it would be especially lucrative for EA (which is probably a bonus for them). Open world games like this are basically endless, they can keep milking it for years. In addition, past games have shown that people are willing to pay for DLC missions, like the Atlantis storyline in AC Odyssey. 

All in all, it seems like a fun idea (that I personally want), which is viable to make, and would be financially successful enough for EA to make.",StarWars,EquivalentInflation,False,/r/StarWars/comments/j0xfgm/ea_or_whoever_ends_up_with_the_star_wars_video/

“Cards Against Star Wars” is all about using **rude and offensive Star Wars-style humor.** Choose your friends wisely, and maybe start recruiting new Star Wars buddies of yours who will take kindly to joking with the Jedi or making announcements about **Death Stars made from certain intimate female parts of the anatomy.** 

Don’t worry, the game is not that complicated and it won’t be necessary to pass any intergalactic training courses. 

So this is how you play:

* Comes with **922 playing cards** in total. 325 dark blue cards and 597 white cards.
* Each round, one player reads from a blue card, and everyone, in turn, answers with their funniest white card.
* And they’re pretty hilarious. For instance, a blue card might read: **“After blowing up the Death Star the Rebels celebrated with \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.”**
* And the answer might be: **“getting an erection in a stormtrooper suit.”**

That’s just a taste of the fun you’ll have. With one swift stroke of your lightsaber or should we say, cautious click of your trigger finger, order the game now to see what else is in store.

62,Disney Star Wars Experience,1601214434,"All-
Not sure if this has been discussed, but I just got back from Disney World Hollywood Studios, and the new Star Wars section is simply amazing. The two main rides deal with driving the Millennium Falcon, and the Rise of the Resistance. Stunning. Just walking around, you feel like you are on Luke’s home planet. There are lots of full sized things to see- space ships, droids, etc.  even the skyline  is perfect. It was obviously created by super fans.

luckily my wife had done some research on how to get on the rides efficiently, and we did everything we wanted to do, with the exception of Oga’s tavern.

1. Losing a limb. Sure, Anakin cut of one of his arms, but that could NOT have caused his death. Losing a limb will not kill you. For example, Luke, Darth Maul, Anakin, all lost limbs but still lived.
2. Force lightning killed him. No force lightning did NOT kill him. I mean, Luke, Anakin, Savage Opress, Darth Maul, all got shocked by lightning but still lived.
3. Fall damage killed Mace Windu. No, fall damage could not have been the reason of his death. Remember in the first battle of Geonisis, he jumped down a pretty high distance from the arena and still survived. ALSO Coleman Trebor seems to have died of fall damage, but he actually died to Jango Fett's blaster fire NOT fall damage.

91,The Mandalorian AKA The Last Jed’aii,1601178166,"

It is clear from the trailer of The Mandalorian Season 2 that the season will be about searching for The Child’s family/origins. Here is my theory of what the Mando will discover.

As the trailer briefly discusses, the Mandalorian were at war with the Jedi millennia before the Skywalker saga (which is when The Mandalorian takes place). The Mandalorian started the war to fight the “sorcerers,” and brought the Jedi to their knees. But what if, the Jedi the Mandalorian fought during the war were not the ‘Jedi’ we are familiar with?

My theory, is that the Mandalorian actually fought an ancient species called the Jed’aii. These Jed’aii were like the ancient Sith species. Thus, the big reveal (one of them) of Mandalorian Season 2 is that name of the species that The Child, Yoda and Yaddle are apart of is the Jed’aii – the OG Jedi.

Therefore,  Baby Yoda is the LAST JED’AII. But that’s not all. As we know, the Mandalorian are a race of orphans, and thus, my prediction is that after learning the truth of the Jed’aii, and the Mandalorians’ role in their slaughter, Mando (Din Jarin) takes The Child (Baby Yoda) in as BUM BUM THE MANDALORIAN. Thus, the title of the show refers not to Din, but rather to the Child. This creates a rather lovely circle to the whole Mando/Jed’aii arc, that the last Jedi’aii is taken in and protected by a Mandalorian as one of their own, to make up for the travesties his ancestors committed.",StarWars,MoSALAH-SUCKS-,False,/r/StarWars/comments/j0k511/the_mandalorian_aka_the_last_jedaii/

21,"Jedi Order: Corrupt, Noble, or somewhere in between?",1601168609,"There is a trend in the fandom recently, where, since Star Wars Canon has recently started to talk about the Jedi Order of the Prequel Era, and highlight their flaws, some fans take this is “The Jedi were corrupt through and through, and needed to be destroyed.” This has caused a pushback from some defenders of the Jedi, who say “The Jedi were a noble organization of heroes that were destroyed by the machinations of the Sith and nothing else.” 

I should point out that neither of these tales are true. So, I have made a list of all the pros and cons of the Jedi Order of the Prequels, and I will also defend or criticize them for various controversial actions. 

I will note that this is Canon only, as I am not too familiar with most Legends material. I may reference it some, for the sake of comparison, but I may be wrong and please correct me if I am. 

**Pros:**

The Jedi helped the Galaxy find peace for thousands of years. You can’t argue with results, and there is no argument to be made that no good came out of their reign. 

They were absolutely in the right to join the Clone Wars. The CIS was an antagonistic organization that would have taken over the Galaxy if they could have. Many parts of the War were questionable, but that is a flaw with the Republic, not the Jedi. In addition, they were only destroying battle droids and not killing any living beings, for the most part. 

They did their best to keep themselves in check. The best example is when Mace (a radical in the Order; many of these praises I give the order may not necessarily apply to him) suggests taking control of the Senate, and Yoda swiftly warns against it, saying it will only lead to Darkness. When Anakin said the Jedi and the Sith are different because the Jedi only seek power for the sake of the good they can do with it, he is absolutely right, and that moment was Sidious’s trickery. 

Yoda’s advice to “let go of everything you fear to lose” is good, solid advice. He certainly could have worded it better, and he may have been a little insensitive, but the basis is good. This contrasts Sith philosophy, which is to hold onto power as much as you can, in order to control what happens. This is reflected in the final deaths of Yoda, Luke, and Sidious. The former two die peacefully, even though it was clearly not comfortable, because they could let go, unlike Palpatine who dies screaming painfully as Rey melts his face off because he *just can’t stop*. 

Individual Jedi were, for the most part, very morally sound individuals. Even Mace Windu, who represents all of the Jedi’s flaws, was still a good person who wanted what was best for everyone. 

**Cons:**

The Jedi were emotionally stifling. Their forbiddance of attachment really hurt Anakin, and who knows how many other Jedi. Yoda’s advice, good as it is, was not what Anakin needed to hear. I believe that this is the reason they could not Force Heal, because they did not allow the emotional connection that is clearly necessary for the power to work. 

Their whole “The Will of the Force” was BS. Mace Windu says to Ahsoka that her rigged trial was just that, and it comes across as a cop-out instead of an apology. Luminara Unduli’s treatment of the Martez Sisters is another example. 

The Jedi were arrogant. They didn’t believe Dooku could have been evil because “oh, he used to be a Jedi.” They didn’t believe a Sith could be controlling the Senate because “Oh, we would have sensed it”. Dooku literally told Obi-Wan as much and they did very little with the information. 

They viewed the Force as a weapon, whether they admitted it or not. So much of their training was based on combat, and one of the most important things they bonded over was a literal weapon. I believe that their training regiment actually *held back* its students from reaching their full potential, given how much people like Luke and Rey grow in a much shorter time with their more philosophical training. The biggest power-ups Jedi get across the Saga is when they submit themselves to the Force and let it guide their actions, and the Jedi Order never did this. This is evident in Mace’s arrest of Palpatine. He is able to beat him in a fight because he can use the Force to fight well, but he is helpless against his trickery, and clueless to Anakin’s emotional state. 

The use of a Clone army was morally reprehensible. They enslaved thousands of sentient beings and forced them to fight and die for a cause they never signed up for. This is both the republic and the Jedi’s fault. 

**Now, I would like to clear up some misconceptions:**

*Jedi should be pacifists*

This is *blatantly false.* They are peacekeepers, which sometimes requires lethal force. Mace Windu killing Jango Fett was clearly in self defense, as Jango was definitely killing Jedi in that arena, as is his attempted killing of Palpatine, who could not be safely detained. 

*That being said*, they shouldn’t kill if they don’t have to. Count Dooku was a harmless prisoner, and Anakin’s killing of him is framed as wrong. It even doesn’t sit right with Obi-Wan. This is why Luke’s final act was a perfect Jedi moment, because while it would have been acceptable to take some lives to allow the Resistance to escape, he managed to do it without killing anyone, except of course himself. 

*The Jedi and the Sith are exactly the same*

Also blatantly false. Everything Anakin said about the Jedi at the opera was true. They only seeked power to help, and while they weren’t perfect at it, they did their best and had good intentions, unlike the Sith. 

Mace and Palpatine’s respective “He’s too dangerous to be left alive”’s we’re down as such so that while they are clearly different, they sound the same to Anakin, who is not a reliable decision maker. Dooku was, as stated above, not a threat. Palaptine, on the other hand, still was. Not only could he still shoot lightning, but this feigning weakness represents how he has complete control of the Republic and cannot be given proper justice. 

Conclusion: The Jedi had many flaws, and definitely could have been better, but they were certainly a force for good in the Galaxy. They fell because of Sith machinations, but if they were better then they could have beaten these machinations.

I like the idea that they always intended to make many of them, and maybe the second was already under construction in secret by the time ANH happened, it just wasn't as far along. That explains why it was so far along in just 3 years (yeah I know Galen Erso stalled) and it makes the writing feel much less lazy.

George: ""we need a big threat for ep6, so uh... they just have another Death Star cuz fuck it""

But this way it makes it seem like it was always part of the plan, because why wouldn't it be? Why build just one ultimate weapon?

38,Why the Sequels left us with the perfect opportunity,1601161112,"Okay, while debating the merits and flaws of the sequels has been done to death - yes, I like them, this isn’t my intent to bring it up.   

My intent is that currently, there isn’t any stories post sequels that I know of, and that is..  awesome!   I mean as much as I want to know the fate of the galaxy far far away, I LOVE the lack of anything currently.   As a long time game master (running tabletop games like dungeons and dragons and well, Star Wars) and an animator who dabbles in writing, I think this is a great moment.  I mean there is a very literal freedom for telling our own stories for the first time in a long while.  

We have a setting that has no massive galactic power, no centralized government.    No jedi (yet) no Sith.  It is amazing.   The story potential is glorious.   The first order can certainly exist still, though weak.   The resistance has no government capability.   Even many planets were self governing while the new republic existed, so there will be lawlessness, and power vacuums and freedom and chaos.   

So many stories.   Want to have hutts seizing power?  Okay!   First order goes back to the supremacy to isolate and rebuild the supremacy so they can leave the galaxy?  Why not!   Some people try to set up some new trade between independent Ryloth and other planets, while running into defunct banking clan?  Sounds fine!   Droid Gotra takes this powervacuum as a sign to mass revolt and take over Long dead Geonosis?  Awesome!

And honestly, I think it’s a lot cooler than them having inhibitor chips in their brains; they could have kept the same story without having to give the clones that extra factor of “it wasn’t their fault.” Instead of having the chips, why not just have the Clones who thought order 66 was wrong disobey the command and desert?

- The Disney Lucasfilm fanfare wasn't present
- (Pretty sure) the Disney era Lucasfilm logo wasn't present
- The 20th Century Fox logo and fanfare played before the movie
- (I'm fairly certain)The 20th Century Fox logo was from the one from the 1980s
- The Emperor was played by Ian McDarmid
- Jeremy Bullouch was credited as Boba Fett in the credits
- The credits as a whole seemed to be from the original cut of the movie (I've only seen the editions from the special edition onward, and I don't believe it was the same as any of the ones I've seen)
- Luke *didn't* yell as he fell after Vader reveals he's his dad

Hasbro should make an electronic helmet based on clones.

They could do a phase 2 helmet mold with different colors for each come legion.

They could make the helmet perfect fit cosplaying with a voice modulator and cooling fans. They could also add LED's so it could light up.

Hasbro HAS MADE PREMIUM HELMETS BEFORE. They made a incenerator trooper with LED's and a voice modulator.

This would be so cool and great for cosplaying. They could make the helmet 150-200 dollars. The incenerator troopers helmet with voice modulation and LED's for 100. Fans would be a nice addition for cosplayers and they can increase the price from the incenerator helmet by 50-100 dollars for the fans and because clones are more popular.

""Pay or I don't do shit."" Watto says.


""You are confusing me for someone who believes you as something more then the trash you crawl through."" Vader says ""Unlock the collars and you might live.""

62,Something I Noticed About Snoke and Palpatine,1601123302,"The reason why Palpatine was willing to risk Kylo and Rey's death through Snoke: 

Palpatine wants a worthy successor primarily in Rey, but possibly in Kylo. Palpatine (as well as Snoke) was very interested in the Skywalker bloodline for its potential to exceed his power, all the way from ROTS to TLJ. Palpatine's faith was shaken in Anakin for losing to Obi-Wan , just as Snoke's was in Kylo for losing to Rey.   

Snoke is NOT Palpatine. Palpatine refered to him in third person. 

Even though Snoke claimed he'd kill Rey, he gave her to Kylo to test his power and resolve. But Palpatine was in Kylo's head from the start. Even when Kylo heard Snoke's voice, it was Palpatine. Palpatine correctly knew that Kylo loved Rey and would NOT kill her.   

One of two things could have happened when Kylo had Rey at Saber-point: 

1)  (what actually did happen) Kylo successfully kills Snoke, proving to be a worthy potential successor to Palpatine's heir, or at the least a worthy teacher to prime Rey for that role. 

2)  Kylo turned on Snoke but both him and Rey failed to kill him and get killed by Snoke themselves. 

&amp;#x200B;

If 2 happened, and Kylo and Rey together couldn't take out Snoke, an artificial being with power comparable but surely less than Palpatine himself, then Palpatine would have been better off just making another clone body for himself instead of possessing either of those two, and he definitely knew this, which is why he was happy to risk their death. Once again, both Palpatine and Snoke expressed interest in the Skywalker bloodline for the immense power, they weren't down to settle for any old average-dark-side-Joe.  Palpatine does NOT love Rey because she's his kin. He never even calls her by name in TROS, she's just a body for him. If 2 happened, Palpatine would have known they weren't worth it. He had no problems killing his own Son (Rey's dad) after all.  

&amp;#x200B;

The continuity between both movies is COMPLETELY there. We have great movies on our hands, lets be thankful. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, Snoke was most likely NOT in on that he was the potential sacrificial lamb. And even if he was and was alright with being killed off, it doesn't change much, although it's more likely that even though he claimed to set up the connection between the two, Kylo hid his true feelings for her from him, deceiving him into believing that he would kill her. 

&amp;#x200B;

Assuming that Snoke wasn;t in on it, Palpatine set up Snoke the same way he set up Dooku in ep 3, and Vader in ep 6. The sequel trilogy did a perfect job of tying the 3 together without being overt about it and letting the movies feel like their own thing whilst still tying it all together.

52,Why is revenge of the Sith not widely considered the best star wars film?,1601079465,"Let's get real here, none of the major complaints are legitimate. 

Star wars youth being called younglings is not strange in the least. 

Vader's voice modulator translated his screams into the nearest phonetic unit 'no'. 

Anakin killed the younglings because he had already crossed a line and needed to go all in to save Padme (or so he thought). 

Mace Window is an excellent character who symbolizes the arrogance of the jedi council and the strict dogma Qui Gon was fighting against. 

He tell Anakin its too dangerous to keep Palpatine alive, same as he was told when Dooku surrendered. 

The cinematography was the best its ever been. 

Coruscant is even more beautiful than in episode 2.  

Bale Organa was the best. Now compare the head delegates of Alderran to the fourth film (A New Hope). 

In this movie you get glimpses of their political system. In the fourth movie the planet explodes and no one mentions it again. Leia doesn't even shed a tear. 

Acting: Hayden Christen kills it with his eyes and desperation after he cuts of Mace's hand. Now in the OT the acting was terrible. Luke watched his foster parents die and he didn't even blink. 

The sound track is the best (Padme's funeral, final duel, etc.) 

Watching the senate be disbanded and then Yoda and Sheev duel it out in the empty remains of the senate floor was the best scene in the entire saga. It was both symbolic and intense. 

You know his plan isn't going to work but its so awesome you're still on the edge of your seat. 

Yoda figures out in the end that he was wrong and Qui Gon was right (deep seen). Therapy sessions with Anakin were great as well. 

Natalie Portman is in her prime. 

Time Management: Empire strikes back spends the first FIFTEEN minutes showing Luke getting beat up by a Yeti. 

ROTS uses its first fifteen minutes to reintroduce Obi Wan and Anakin's friendship as equals, sets up General Grevious, executes a massive space battle, and kills Dooku. 

That's what I call efficiency.  

The world looks the nicest with the usage of CGI and actual models.

20,Im just gonna say it knowing ill get downvoted: Ahsoka is BY FAR the most overrated character (rant),1601061616,"...and actively detriments the franchise (and fanbase) due to it

Seriously, its always ""ahsoka this"" ""ahsoka that"" ""ahsoka in mando season 2!"" ""Whats ahsoka up to?"" ""Where is ahsoka?""

Most of TCW season 7 (and almost all of its marketing) was dedicated to her, making it feel like ""the ahsoka wars"" and not ""the clone wars"", all the fan attention is eyed towards her, meaning other popular characters in the things she stars in dont get merch etc, like ive been waiting 12 years for a Ventress Action figure, but ahsoka? She has 2 black series and one of those was released in between when hasbro said they wanted to do ventress and now (WHICH WE STILL DONT HAVE!)

Ahsoka gets a novel, stars in another tv show, has rumours of starring in another, forces of destiny, almost an entire season of a show dedicated to her, merch etc, while her supposed ""rival"" Ventress gets an awful novel and 2 one-shot comics

Ahsoka is extremely bland, she, in terms of core character, brings nothing new to the table, just the run of the mill ""arrogant jedi padawan trope #207"" she gets pushed WAY too much so that other characters take a sideline to her, she has a ton of flaws no one acknowledges, *yet they criticize Rey for*

Its just frustrating to see another product/story/whatever launch and it has a token ahsoka in it when she doesnt need to be there

Plus the fanbase is just awful, you try and criticise her in any way and you'll instantly get 3 people jumping on you telling you how you're wrong, leading to no one criticising her and giving a false assumption that she has little to no flaws

Its just...other characters deserve the love she gets, but that'll never happen unless Lucasfilm takes a break from her for a while

Yeah its just a rant, but its just sad to see ahsoka every single day and hardly anything on the other main characters of TCW or Rebels

53,Can you help me expand my star wars story?,1601054873,"Hey everyone, I'll try to keep this short and sweet....

I am a Physical Education/Health teacher and currently I'm teaching digitally via Zoom. 

I've take this opportunity to get creative with the platform and Star Wars Them several of my lessons. 

Lesson 1: I told the students I had a guest teacher coming in to teach them how to use a lightsaber and what it means to be a Jedi. We did some exercises, and I used the acronym JEDI (Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusiveness) to have a discussion about social-emotional-learning (SEL). 

The kids LOVED it. So when Lesson 2 came around, I jumped in a little deeper, and continued the story. Basically I made a video of my Jedi (his name is Arias Ga'fel) leaving earth on a spaceship only to be attacked by a Sith Lord (Darth Urgak). In the Story, Arias Ga'fel is intercepted by Darth Urgak, only to be blown up by the Sith Lord. The Sith Lord comes to earth to test the students to see if they are TRUE Jedi;s. We then do a Physical FItness test (with light Sabers) and then a mental test (Review the JEDI acronym and discuss appropriate behavior),  The lesson culminates with Darth Urgak becoming a good guy and leaving earth.

This is where I am now. ANyone have any story ideas I could run with? New (easy to put together) characters I could introduce? This is for grades 1st-5th btw.

My ideas thus far:

Video of Darth Urgak doing nice things as a ""reformed"" sith lord.

Arias Ga'fel (unknown to us) hits the escape hatch at the last moment and escapes death, but then feels he must defeat Darth Urgak (despite him being a good guy). 

&amp;#x200B;

Not really sure where to go from here, but if you have any great ideas, let me know. I can always shoehorn in SEL stuff into it.

I for one, do not like this movie and really want to tear it apart. It’s the one Star Wars movie that I believe is a failure on every level. 

Would anyone watch a series where I dissect the movie and give me opinions on everything that went wrong? If you liked the movie that’s an obvious no and I completely understand that. 

It’s ideally be in 10-15 minute segments where I analyze each and every character, the story and where the movie went wrong lore-wise. (I’m not a film buff so I can’t break down the cinematography and all that jazz)

Would anyone be interested in that? I’d try and make it decently entertaining and not just me rambling.

That would explain the force sensitivity in the child as he was conceived from force sensitive parents. Yaddle then hid the child during the great Jedi purge to save his life because they were being hunted or as a precaution and he has been hidden until the Mandalorian found him. Yaddle was never seen after the phantom menace nor mentioned. Yoda did break the rule or did he?! He did form an attachment with Yaddle to conceive the child either out of survival for there species or out of love.

He acts like a child decently enough.

The only place Anakin seems over the top is when he blows up the Federation ship at the end, but as an actor, Jake seems like he did it all perfectly competently for a child actor. Not as good as his costar Natalie Portman did in Leon when she was his age, but good nonetheless.

They were the best of the Jango Fett clones in the  eyes of the Kamiinoans, and probably Republic Command as well.

The Bad Batch were made up of the most imperfect, flawed clones, and their training appears to have been average, if not below average. However, they each worked hard to hone to perfection an ability that makes them an effective member of their team. They were the worst of the Jango Fett clones, and Republic Command knew that, but still used them because of their raw effectiveness.

They are opposite sides of the same coin, and are both extremely effective teams. Neither has a huge advantage over the other, but I think the Empire would see the Commandos as the perfect fit for hunting down the Bad Batch.

Not sure if it was good casting or incredible luck or both that created such a great chemistry with the Hanukeia (Han/Luke/Leia) but IMO those were the best parts.

I read a post in this thread from around 8 months ago saying that if they just waved her off, they'd look stupid. Well, I'd expect Finn to be incredibly pissed. Rey was hoping for someone to connect with her and someone who understands her? Finn is RIGHT HERE!

Poe, on the other hand would look like a huge hypocrite for being mad at Rey given his relationship with Zorii. Poe was hoping to connect with Zorii and was attracted to her. He tried to get her to leave the Spice Runners, but realized she actually WANTED that life and she was beyond saving at that point. Sound familiar? That's what Rey did with Kylo. She tried to get him to come over to the light side, but he didn't want to and was beyond saving at that point. Also, both Kylo and Zorii were abusive towards Rey and Poe respectively (Zorii moreso in Free Fall), but at least Zorii got a chance to fully redeem herself.

Actually, after reading Free Fall, then rewatching TROS, the ""Can I kiss you?"" and silent flirting between Poe and Zorii scenes had the same energy as the Reylo kiss in my opinion.",StarWars,ScorpioGirl1987,False,/r/StarWars/comments/iyks01/finn_and_poes_reaction_to_reylo_kiss/

Most memorably the final season and even more specifically again the final for episodes, were the best depiction of the despair, turmoil and overall gut wrenching ever created in the Star Wars universe.

The episodes depicted were what every Star Wars fan wanted to see from “The revenge of the Sith”. They showed the friendships that were broken, the bonds that were ripped apart and the loyalty that was shattered to pieces.

The most prevalent scene for me was the scene in which shows the love Ashoka showed towards her comrades of a long war, despite their unknown betrayal, she buried them one by one. Ashoka showed them compassion and understanding even after their unfair, unjust and forceful treachery. The scene was beautifully animated with dark tones of colours and a heartbreaking soundtrack playing, unveiling the deep and unbroken bond between friends.",StarWars,conor_casey,False,/r/StarWars/comments/iyklev/perfection/

If you were like me you were disappointed to say the least with the the new Disney star wars trilogy and I have been with star wars for a long time I have seen all of the ups and downs read the comic all the way from form the infinite empire to the legacy era like many fans
But this time it is different even in the oh so hated prequels (still love ep3 btw) thing happened and they made sense there some logic some sort of plan 
But the Disney have no plan no logic 
They are just ... bad 
Any ways that is not the point 
The point is we are big we are really big us star wars fans have the power to create you know it dose take much to create something
We don't have or need a multi million dollar film to make our own sequels
We how to animate how draw how to write (I don't) 
And yah we have the all the book but 
Am not looking to erase the sequels 
Just fix them in a way 
I had some ideas  
Like the imperial remnants joining as a government against the first order
A huge battle on and over Croissant involving the imperial remnants the first order and the new republic 
The first order using star killer of the dumb ass star destroyers to destroy Croissant the effects it has on the force 
And many many more

Qui Gon dies, Anakin becomes Obi Wan's padawan, Palpatine becomes the father figure for Anakin instead of Qui Gon and Anakin turns to the dark side, but brings balance to the force in episode 6.

54,I would not have believed Vader in The Empire strikes back,1600873371,"A couple of months ago I thought about what my reaction would have been to Vader revealing himself as Luke's father if i did see the movies chronologically.

I remember my first Star Wars movie was Return of the Jedi. So from the very beginning I knew that Vader was Luke's father. I don't know in what order I saw IV and V but it was not a shock to me when Vader told Luke ""No, I am your father"" (I was also a kid).

So I thought if I were sitting in the cinema in 1980 with no possibility of spoilers because no one saw the movie before I would not believe Vader.

He's the evil dude. No, we just found out he's the super evil dude's henchman. He would say everything to make Luke join the Empire because he is the last Jedi. Vader doesn't know about Yoda on Dagobah and Obi-Wan is dead. Pretty much everyone else was killed by him/the Empire as Obi-Wan told Luke in IV. There were no clues for the normal movie goer. I mean I love that little sign of hesitation in Obi-Wan's face before he tells Luke how Anakin ""died"" (from a certain point of view) but you don't notice that when you see the movie for the first time.

So far, we’ve seen the Jedi and Sith with their ‘standard’ way of sensing/manipulating the force, the Witches of Dathomir and their Magick, the Guardians of the Whills who seem to have a passive sensory connection to the force, the Lasat who call it the Ashla and channel it through their bo-rifles to see visions, and the navigators in the unknown regions who use the force to navigate hyperspace (the Chiss call it third sight, the Navigators Guild calls it the Great Presence).

Padmé was the first of the two to question the Jedi at all and, in fact, Anakin got very angry at her for it! i don’t think either of them were bootlickers. i think Padmé questioned authority and Anakin was a troubled kid that just got repeatedly taken advantage of. we all know that Palpatine manipulated the shit out of him, telling him he can make sure Padmé “doesn’t die”, knowing Anakin was scared, and effectively making him resent the Jedi. but before that, did the Jedi council not basically force him to start training under Obi-Wan, (who definitely was a bootlicker by the way.) no questions asked? he got ripped from the only consistent thing in his life (his mother) with no contact with her at all and tricked him into feeling familial comfort for the sake of having another soldier and forcing him to completely mask any sadness or fear he felt? i think Anakin’s story is tragic from beginning to end. neither him nor Padmé were bootlickers. i think until Padmé, Anakin had nobody who gave a shit about what was best for him. they gave him a false sense of it, but Padmé was the only one who cared about what was in Anakin’s best interest. not the Jedi, not the Sith, but Anakin Skywalker. the Jedi only made him think they cared for the sake of their military force.",StarWars,indiemichaelcera,False,/r/StarWars/comments/iy4twf/bootlicking_in_star_wars/

One of my colleagues who has grown to become a dear friend of mine has had a really challenging year. 

He is a huge Star Wars fan and while we were eating lunch today he mentioned to me how badly he wants to be able to purchase the **new 4K box set** that has been released. He admitted that as much as he wants it he knows it’s not a good decision for him to spend that kind of money on himself when he has a family to care for.

I don’t really know much about Star Wars (recently just watched a few of the films for the first time ever) and would like to gift him this box set for Christmas.

He mentioned it was pricey ($350 if not more) but I am guessing I will have some other colleagues that will chip in on this. I’m just not sure which box set it would be and really don’t want to purchase the wrong one!

Any advice or recommendations??

56,[Potential Mando S2 Spoilers] A certain character may not go over well with unaware Star Wars fans,1600797769,"So I was just watching the S2 Rebels finale and had to explain to my middle-aged father who Ahsoka Tano was. Both my parents are Star Wars fans from back when the original trilogy was released but have only really kept up with the main 9 movies and the Mandalorian on Disney+.        
Knowing that Ahsoka is rumoured (or actually confirmed I think?) to appear in the Mandalorian's second season, I figured I'd give him the lowdown so he's not confused if she appears, although I'm guessing they'll do a brief fill-in of her backstory.          
He was confused and frustrated, saying ""oh so they're just inventing timelines now"" when I told him she was Anakin's apprentice before he fell. I think this might end up being a common reaction for fans who've not kept up with SW media outside of the major movies, especially since Ahsoka is a fairly big deal despite only appearing as a brief voice cameo in TROS.           
I hope it doesn't happen since Ahsoka is my favourite character from Star Wars, but I'm prepared for there to be a backlash if she does appear.",StarWars,What-The-Heaven,False,/r/StarWars/comments/ixsofz/potential_mando_s2_spoilers_a_certain_character/

72,Dog fighting in space makes no sense,1600753743,Why is it in star wars we so often see fighters in world war two style dog fights.  What is this top gun in space.  Dog fighting is somewhat rare with modern fighter jets.  Long range missiles are a better option.  And drones could eliminated the need for manned fighters.  So I find it difficult to believe that a space faring civilization would resort to world war two style dog fighting tactics.  Simple solution.  Build missiles with hyper drives and put the biggest warheads you have on them.  That way you can destroy enemy bases and ships from a distance.  And if you do need to use fighters use drones.  Only use manned fighters when you have a damn good reason to.  In star wars the rebels are highly mobile and hidden.  But they know where the empire is.  So these tactics would work well for them.

By comparison Activtision bought King Digital (makers of Candy Crush) for $5.9 billion in 2016.

Microsoft just bought Bethesda for $7.5 billion.

Now I haven’t done an in depth study into any of the financial reporting s of any of these companies, and I also recognize that in some respects we are comparing apples to oranges. But even at the time in 2012 $4 Billion seemed incredibly low.

The article I read compared the buyout of Bethesda to Lucasfilm buyout to justify just how lucrative the video game industry has become. I’m not sure that is a fair comparison if GL didn’t actually seek Fair Market Value.

GL donated all of that buyout to charity. He also left Star Wars in the hands of people he thought who could/would continue the legacy.

This question has always seems to intrigue me. 

Who do you think is a better Starfighter pilot?

In my view, I think Anakin would be slightly better than Han for the following reasons:

• Greater experience flying, especially on combat missions. 

• Force-sensitivity plays a large role in reflexes and precognition.

93,I was Incredibly disappointed by The Mandalorian,1600690199,"I’m super excited for all the cool star wars locations it’s gonna take me to! Let’s list out the locations. flat featureless ice ball, tattooine but gray with lava, literally just tattooine but with a different name complete with Jawas in sand crawlers, moisture vaporators and tattooine architecture, a flat featureless forrest. Oh. hmm. Well at least I’m still super excited for the cool new republic prison barge! Oh, it’s just a rectangle on the outside and a single repeated hallway that looks like a set from the 1970s run of doctor who on the inside. Hm.
   Well I’m still excited to see all the cool space bounty hunter stuff mando does! Is he going to hunt down targets by tracking down leads, meeting with old trusted informants, stalking around seedy alien cantinas, sending out robot scouts, and using sci-fi tracker tools and abilities? Oh, it’s just a magical interstellar tracker that works like a video game quest beacon. hmmmm. Still excited for all the cool characters he meets along the way! Oh, they’re all one dimensional archetypes with dialogue from a CW show and acting that would feel more at home on a community theatre stage than on the set of a tv show belonging to the largest and most culturally significant modern fictional universes with an astronomical budget and oscar-nominated directors, producers, screenwriters, and crew. hm. 
      Well at least we’re in for a treat with all the spectacle that Star Wars and The Mandalorian’s enormous effects budget brings with it! Oh shit, the new republic strike force is gonna arrive and destroy the space station! Huh, it’s just 3 original trilogy x-wings with pilots that sound like they haven’t had their morning coffee. Hm. 
   Well, the writing’s gotta be good right? I mean after all it is written by John Favreau and Dave Filoni. Oh, the dialogue is largely laughable and the plot is paced like a 3rd grade “what I did over the summer” essay. hm. 
   Well there’s still much more left in the season, it’ll probably get better. Wait, that’s it? There were only 8 episodes. Some of them weren’t even 30 minutes. Nothing happened. They stretched the plot of an hour long pilot into an entire season. I’ve watched youtube web series with that were longer and had more story. We got a fetch quest, the seven samurai but short and not good, a rookie story that was ok, an almost unwatchable heist episode, and a finale where the villain corners the heroes but they escape because he just kinda forgets about them.

There were many things that I like about the mandalorian. The fight scenes were cool, Pedro Pascal was great, Carl Weathers was a treat, Nick Nolte and the nanny droid were a pleasure to watch, baby yoda was cute. Werner Herzog was Werner Herzog. But the overall experience was incredibly empty and substance-less. 
The writing is uniformly poor and the guest acting ranges from passable to abysmal. The set design, costume design, and art direction is ridiculously unimaginative and sterile for a production of this scale and budget. It had a budget of $15 mil per episode but looks like it was made for $5 mil total. The early game of thrones episodes cost 5-10 mil each and we’re far longer, denser, more aesthetically inspired, with better acting, writing, and cinematic quality.  Season 8 GoT episodes, regardless of the writing quality, cost $15 mil each, the same price as a Mandalorian episode but three to four times the length with summer blockbuster movie level set pieces.

Thats all I've watched so far, but I want to dig deeper into the franchise. Oh, I've also started the Jedi Fallen Order game, although it doesnt looks very connected, but I love playing games and this game has generally good reviews, so why not.

I've heard about Clone Wars, Rebels and Ressisstance. Are they worth watching? I've usually heard good reviews about Clone Wars here on reddit, but no about other two. And is there any other media, which is worth watching?

Lastly, which order should I watch? I usually prefer release order and definitely not the chronological order.

34,Star Wars viewing order idea,1600665846,"So I was thinking through the order I’d want to introduce someone to Star Wars with, and I’ve had a brand new idea that seems kinda cool to me. I’ll list the order, then explain it, then I’d love to hear feedback.

- ANH

- ESB

- ROTJ

- TFA

- TLJ

- TPM

- AOTC

- ROTS

- Rogue One

- Solo

- TCW

- Rebels

So, here’s my logic. We start out with the OT so that we can preserve the Vader reveal, the Leia reveal, and introduce all of the great relationships and chemistry present there. Next, we move onto TFA to keep going with those characters that they’ve probably fallen in love with. We see Han’s tragic death and Luke’s cliffhanger. They watch TLJ to get the answer to the cliffhanger, then they ask themselves what was so bad about the Jedi since they seemed great in the OT. Then, we move on to see the flaws of the Jedi through the PT, where they were shown on full display.

Skip ahead to ROTS because there’s not much to explain for the PT story. They’ve seen the flaws of the Jedi on full display, and we’ve introduced them to Palpatine’s masterful plotting, including the introduction of a massive secret army (AOTC) and the setup of his quest for eternal life (ROTS). Then, we jump into TROS, where we see another massive secret army, the eternal life quest finally completed, and Palpatine’s plotting on full display once again (as well as all these Jedi voices that they just spent 3 movies listening to). At this point, they decide how they feel about Star Wars. If they didn’t enjoy it, we would’ve quit by now. If they were neutral, we won’t make them watch anymore if they don’t want to. If they loved it, however, now’s the time to introduce them to the larger universe.

Start with Rogue One to show the setup to ANH, as well as Leia’s surprise scene immediately following the movie of her death. Next, show them Solo with the states premise of setting up Han’s character like we set up Leia’s. We won’t tell them everything because we want them to be surprised. Then, they get a surprise introduction to the early days of the Rebellion and, most importantly, Maul’s return. They’re super confused as to how he’s alive after he was cut in half so many movies ago. This is our opportunity to introduce them to TCW and eventually Rebels so that they get to see Maul’s full story, as well as other little tidbits with Ahsoka, Kanan and Ezra, Thrawn, etc. At this point, we’ve properly introduced them to the intricacies of the universe and we let them choose their own path from here on out.

So what do you all think? Is my logic sound? Would this order work well, or would it make no sense to someone who knows absolutely nothing about Star Wars?

56,It's weird that Naboo's seat in the Senate became vacant when Palpatine was appointed to be Chancellor,1600649670,"It looks like the Chancellor is the head of the executive branch of government and the Senate is the legislative branch.

Yet in most parliaments, cabinet members are considered to be the incumbent of their constituency's seat. The Prime Minister of the UK is also the member of parliament for his constituency. This is not so in the Galactic Republic. Somehow, when the Senate named Palpatine to the executive, Naboo's legislative seat opened up.

That raises the question: Could the Senate have chosen someone not amongst itself to the executive? It might as well, because what would be the point of asking them to win a Senate seat first only for them to immediately resign from it to join the executive? If so, the Chancellor is merely someone hired for the job by the Senate, not accountable to the electorate and not part of the Senate. So why all the pomp an circumstance for the Chancellor if he is only an employee of the Senate and not an elected official in his own right?

This makes it even stranger that the Senate didn't make the Chancellor report to the Senate more often after the Senate gave him emergency powers.

I thought it was great, the cinematography, battles, visuals, sound, characters and such. I have difficulties actually explaining why i loved it, as i can clearly see the flaws of the movie aswell, but i just did. However, i think i can understand why it may have divided audiences in the way it did. 

I guess as someone who never really fangirled over the OG trilogy, i can understand that i would be less impacted by the way they treated Lukes character. However, i would be thrilled to see your opinions on the matter.

71,Attack of the clones gets too much hate,1600639516,"Hear me out before you comment. Also this is just MY opinion.

The movie starts out with a really cool chase through coruscant, and shapes how some of the film will go.

Then, Obi-wan makes his way to kamino and anakin and padme go to naboo simultaneously. Kamino is a cool planet and jango fett is a cool character although young boba is kinda disappointing. The obi-wan vs jango battle is fine.

Everything involving natalie portman and hayden christensen is just absolutely terrible and these scenes have some of the worst lines in movie history. Everything anakin says makes me cringe. After, anakin and padme go back to tatooine. This part is just okay.

I’m gonna skip ahead to jedi arena, a few things happen before this, but nothing really that interesting. IMO, the jedi arena was pretty cool and you first see the clones here. Then, obi wan and anakin make their way over to count dooku. Christopher lee is a plus, and the final battle is just fine. It’s not boring, it’s just not as good as some other battles in the trilogy. The movie ends with anakin and padme getting married.

Pros (MY OPINION): coruscant chase, kamino, jedi battle, christopher lee

Cons: anakin/padme romance, young boba

89,Is the force a single entity or two separate entities ?,1600625690,"So I heard about the jedi Fey, who devoted herself completely to the force and was rewarded by the “force” with immortality. 

And then I heard about the calling Palpatine heard from the unknown regions. A calling of the “dark side”. 

When ever the jedi say follow the will of the force, they seem to be referring to the “light side”. 

Yet I keep hearing that the “force” is about balance.

So the thing is if the light side has rewarded Fey and the dark side was calling Palpatine. It almost like the the force is not a singular vast entity but two vast entities. 

Or is it that there is no side and there just there force and how we interact with it, and it’s side effects ?

Some ideas I have are:

* TPM: The duel on Naboo goes differently so Maul doesn't get bisected and he returns to Sidious, Qui-Gon lives and trains Anakin and Obi-Wan leaves the Jedi Order to be with Satine.
* AOTC: Obi-Wan joins Dooku and Jango survives and forms his own faction of Mandalorians.
* The Clone Wars: After Ventress is betrayed by Dooku, Talzin sends her to find Maul.
* ROTS: Windu survives and pursues Anakin to Mustufar who is forced to escape just before Padme arrives.
* Rebels: Ezra joins Maul
* ANH: Alderaan isn't destroyed which leads to both Tarkin and Obi-Wan surviving. Leia is eventually rescued and becomes Obi-Wan's padawan while Luke goes to Dagobagh.
* TESB: Luke stays on Dagobagh and Vader finds out Leia is his daughter and trains her.
* ROTJ: Luke stays with the rebel team on Endor and Vader goes after him (maybe have the Emperor escape from the Death Star).

Okay, I really like this film (yes I’m British) and I don’t hate it as much as other people do. I understand where the hate comes from, jar jar can be quite annoying but he isn’t for me, neither is young anakin. Anakin is just a kid in this one, of course he’s gonna be annoying but maybe I’m just used to it after looking after all my younger cousins. I will admit the film feels quite slow at some points like on Coruscant but I think the duel with Darth Maul (one of my favourite characters btw) is epic and makes up for it. I love the fast pace fights of the prequels and duel of the fates is also brilliant. I don’t know what to say really. I liked the podracing part, that was intense and had lots of moments that had me at the edge of my seat. Also I don’t what that super speed was at the beginning of the film. Obi wan and Qui Gon just zoomed away from the destroyers and I don’t know why that move wasn’t used in other situations. 

Overall I think this film is great and would give it a 7 out of 7/10. Feel free to leave your opinions below and please no hate.

21,Quick theory about the importance of Count Dooku,1600587652,"So we all know that one of the main reasons Anakin became a Jedi was that Qui-Gon Jinn insisted on his training. And he insisted on his training even when the council was against him. He was very connected with the force and didn't really like the council as he thought that the council was to political and wasn't following what the force wanted. All that is canon. 

Now that we know that, the question that remains is why Qui-Gon was like that. Well I think this has to do with Dooku. Dooku was his master because he turned to the dark side. But before he left the Jedi order he resembled Qui-Gon quit a bit. Both didn't think high about the council and thought they became to political. Both thought that the senate was corrupt and that the Jedi order should separate themselves more from the senate. So I think it was Dooku who trained Qui-Gon to think this way. While this ideas turned Dooku to go away from the Jedi and to the dark side they pushed qui-gon more to the light. So to a certain degree  the main reason Anakin got trained and found by qui-gon was a result from the teaching from Dooku. Let me know about if you think it is to far fetched.

In my opinion Hayden should not have won the Golden Raspberry, then again, honestly I don't like Razzies after all, IMO they are nothing more than a mock ceremony of a guy who makes fun of movies considered bad because he is upset that he never became a filmmaker and which for some reason ended up getting taken seriously.

18,I Finally Finished TIE Fighter!,1600554968,"I finally finished TIE Fighter! 

I played through TIE fighter back in the 90s.. probably the floppy disk version. I owned the DOS-CD and Special Editions, but never actually played them all the way through (also haven't finished XWA yet, sssshhh!).

So I've had the game in my To-Do list for... 25+ years now. At first I was too busy with other games, then eventually I didn't have a computer with a gameport for my HOTAS setup anymore. 

In December I finally splurged on an X52 Pro HOTAS (disclaimer: I can't recommend it. You should get something else). Then I stared at it for five months and finally forced myself to start playing on May 5th. Revenge of the Fifth. I decided to make a let's play of it, to keep myself from quitting mid-way through, or from turning on the cheats, or from playing on easy... but mainly to stop myself from quitting (it's a 90s game, after all. I expected it to be hard).

And BOY! I didn't remember almost ANYHING! I remember feeling like I was a tiny cog in the massive machinery that is the Empire. I remembered fighting mainly the Rebel Alliance, Pirates, and other dissenters.

None of that is true. The game starts just after the Battle of Hoth... you're on cleanup duty, essentially. and you have a ton of wingmen. it feels great. However, as you progress in the ranks, you are given more advanced ships, the Gunboat, TIE Advanced, TIE Defender and Missile Boat... and to balance the gameplay out, they have to make it so you're mostly alone... and either make your wingmen die real quickly, or just script them to straight up leave in the middle of the mission... I don't care if your targeting computer is busted, I'm flying without RADARS here! 

and yet... that last bit? is actually pretty cool. Because you are flying an experimental ship at the time. it's bound to run into technical issues... and you're behind enemy lines trying to get back to Imperial controlled space.

Anyway, my biggest concern is that the last 7-8 battles (or the last 40+ mission) are fought almost exclusively against other imperials, not the rebel alliance. Which again I can understand to a certain extent. You have such overpowered ships compared to the rebel scum that it becomes kind of laughable. Even though I spent the majority of my time fighting other TIE variants and Gunboats.. Y-Wings are still my most-killed targets (111 killed, with A-wings being second at 69 (nice!)). Oh, and Advanced Missiles can go jump in a well. It only takes two to kill you, except if you're in a Gunboat, then two will 'merely' remove all your shields and damage 2-3 of your systems... and some capital ships can shoot a new one at you every 10-20 seconds if they want.

Anyway, I started playing the Collector's CD version of the game. Better music, arguably better-aged graphics, and better voices. but it also has some things wrong with it. Such as: Joystick drift. If you want a high framerate, then stations and capital ships will not fire their weapons... So I switched to the Special Edition and upgraded its graphics, resolution(1440x1080), music, voices, and got 60FPS. There are still some wonky things like the aspect ratio in certain sections of the game being squished... but I can live with that.

There is one game in the Special Edition version that is entirely bugged, and that is Battle 13: Mission 5. In the DOS-CD/collector's CD version, 16 Muurian Transport spread out to attack 4 weapons platforms, but in the SE version they all gang up on one single platform. it melts before you've even managed to deal with half the transports. ALL the platforms MUST survive to clear the mission.

You can clear it on Easy... OR you can do what I did and get one of the old mission editors and fix the bug so that they actually do spread out (in the mission structure, 12 of the MUTRs are supposed to attack Able 1-3 and then if they kill their first target, they go for Albe 4. but in-game they start with Able 4. so.. I just removed their extra goal of going for Able 4 entirely. because it doesn't matter. if Able 1-3 dies, the mission is a failure.)


while I recommend playing through this classic, the difficulty curve is all over the place. So if you do want to play or replay the game, I'd suggest playing on Medium for the main story (Battles 1-7), and switch to Easy for the Expansions (8-10 + 11-13)... and if it takes you more than 5-6 tries to finish a mission, turn on either infinie warheads or even invincibility. Some of the missions took me 12-13 tries to do, and I had to give up on some secondary and bonus goals... or be stuck on that mission forever. All in all, it took me 4 months and 2 weeks to finish the game.

I love the game, I love the aesthetic, I love the sounds of just flying a TIE Fighter, but man am I glad I'm done with it. and just in time for a small break before Star Wars: Squadrons too! Was thinking about starting on X-Wing Alliance, but... I need that break.

62,The Genius of the Flashbacks and How It Compliments the Saga,1600540929,"Now before I get started I just want to say, TLJ is my favourite Star Wars film of all time and I LOVE how Luke was handled. If you disagree then that is fine but I just wanted to discuss the flashbacks because not only do I feel that they don't get enough credit, but also that so many people think Luke tried to kill Ben. News flash, he never tried to. Anyway lets get started.

Flashback 1 - *""I went to confront him....and he turned on me. He must've thought I was dead. When I came to, the temple was burning. He vanished with a handful of my students and slaughtered the rest. Leia blamed Snoke but it was me. I failed. Because I was Luke Skywalker. Jedi Master. A legend.""*

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fuiimku5g5o51.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cfa518366d093c6d8d8826a9701513c2d209de62

Despite what many people think, Luke **isn't** lying in this scene. ""I went to confront him.......and he turned on me"". While Luke is leaving out LOADS of information here, he is still technically telling the truth. Already this compliments the original films because not only does it refer back to Obi-Wan's ""lie"" in Episode 4 but what Luke told us was true ""from a certain point of view"". Now people may think ""Why didn't Luke tell Rey the whole truth?"" but why should he? Not only does he barely know her but this is after her dark side moment and to a certain extent, he is terrified of her power and her reaction if she found out. Most importantly though, he doesn't want to be reminded of his greatest failure.  He resents himself and his legend status because not only did he not live up to it, but he failed the galaxy and believed that everyone would be better off without ""Luke Skywalker, Jedi Master"" as he only makes things worse. But as Rey said *""The galaxy may need a legend""* which is true at the end of the film. Also I like how you can see a green light in the hut, a visual foreshadow of what actually happened.

&amp;#x200B;

Flashback 2 - *""He sensed my power, as he senses yours......and he feared it.""*

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uvlgbc27g5o51.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=00f0a695c0679afbed8db40deb22e6b633e1cb5c

I have seen so many people bring this flashback up on why Luke was out of character but this NEVER happened. Well actually it kind of did (from a certain point of view ;) ). This is technically true from Ben's perspective. Ben woke up in the middle of the night and the first thing he saw was Luke with a lightsaber towering over him. Of course he is going to view it as malicious and as Rian said in the film commentary, the flashback has been warped by Ben's anger towards his uncle. Here, Luke looks like a psychopath ready to strike him down and this presents Ben as the one in the right. This is definitely a call back to Revenge of the Sith with *""From my point of view the Jedi are evil!""* as Ben sees the Jedi as evil because Luke tried to strike him down which, as his grandfather said, is *""not the Jedi way!""*. So now we have two flashbacks, both of them are technically true from a certain point of view but we shouldn't trust Kylo completely as he is the antagonist after all.

&amp;#x200B;

Flashback 3 - *""I saw darkness. I sensed it building in him, I'd seen it in moments during his training. But then I looked inside, and it was beyond what I ever imagined. Snoke had already turned his heart. He would bring destruction and pain and death, and the end of everything I love because of what he would become. And for the briefest moment of pure instinct, I thought I could stop it. It passed like a fleeting shadow, and I was left with shame. And with consequence. And the last thing I saw, were the eyes of a frightened boy whose master had failed him.""*

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s3jl1858g5o51.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47145d7aeaa744fd7b5e0960ed1b557a798491fc

This is what ACTUALLY happened. Luke sensed darkness in his nephew and he couldn't talk about it to Ben as he would deny it. So he looked into his mind and saw a dark warrior killing everyone he has ever loved: Leia, Han, Chewbacca, C-3PO, R2-D2, his students and etc.  While immersed in this vision, on instinct (some people say it wasn't as he took a while to ignite his saber but I think that was just to build tension in the film) he pulled out his lightsaber to kill this dark warrior and save them. But that ignition snaps him out of it. He is no longer in the vision, there is no dark warrior. He is in a hut with his sleeping nephew below him. He finally realizes what he has done and is immediately filled with shame. This isn't what Luke Skywalker would have done. If Ben stayed asleep, he would have left and talked to him later without his weapon. But it was too late, the damage had been done. As many people said, this reflects back to ROTJ where Luke acted on instinct and attacked his father to save his sister. However while in that film he only realized what he was doing when Vader was on the ground missing a hand, it only took Jed Master Luke Skywalker a few seconds to stop himself which shows real growth. If this was ROTJ Luke, Ben Solo would be dead. Even the camera shots are very similar. Take a look:

https://preview.redd.it/ydb7qt39g5o51.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=917f498e387b2c00dcb5b774fbf4b201389f249b

&amp;#x200B;

(I never noticed the similarities in the two images before but when Eric  from ""Blind Wave"" on YouTube pointed it out, I had to show it to everyone. Here is the video where he pointed it out at 25:41 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62dxbCpi\_WI&amp;t=1604s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62dxbCpi_WI&amp;t=1604s)))

While in ROTJ his defeat of the dark side was his greatest triumph, in TLJ it was his greatest failure. That is extremely poetic and ironic. Plus this refers back to Yoda's teachings in TESB:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/np26dm5bg5o51.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad65dbc3297e8c6c79264313e0a11998ef42b29f

While he was immersed in this vision his mind wasn't on *""where he was, what he was doing""*. People say he should have learnt from that but I don't think you can control your instincts. Plus, in the OT, I felt he never conquered that aspect of himself, only the darkness within him. But that's just me though. And finally this obviously reflects back to the Prequels where Anakin senses the future of the death of his loved ones.

&amp;#x200B;

This also makes sense why Luke threw away his former lightsaber when Rey offered it to him. The lightsaber blade is blue. Obvious I know but when was the last time he saw a blue blade?

https://preview.redd.it/fzt0ksecg5o51.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=016409ef2d6d4a644440d9f4b5436522d699ac3a

Yeah it doesn't really surprise me that he threw it away, it probably brought back a lot of bad memories. However at the end of the film he takes it back, finally accepting what happened and has forgiven himself on what he did.

74,Should another star wars movie be ever made again?,1600488599,"Should a movie of Sw be made again or just stick to prequel shows from now on? Cause I've said it before, the most I think they could do is a story away from jedi and sith and they can have lightsabers used by non force users but there should only be 1 force user and be a jedi cause I dont see why anymore sith would exist. But no more clones of vader, luke, han, the OT, none of that. And im still of the opinion to have alien and droid heroes, there is no reason it cant happen, star wars even at its lowest can afford the best of best effects, zero reason to not show them off more. I guarantee you 99.9% of all the alien and droid costumes are in some vault at disney or sold off to someone. Chewbacca suit, yoda puppet, milenium falcon, stuff like that will be held in high regard but most everything else isnt and its sad.

&amp;#x200B;

But Im curious to hear your ideas and please for the love of god dont just say we want good characters, good stories, good writing, original ideas. Elaborate on that please, like what kind of good do you want, are you talking about lack of plot holes? And the original content, that too, it doesnt take a genius to know this, not everything original is great and its hard to do it that can grab in people. Marketing is a big issue here, for what I guess would be considered episode 10, would you market the force and lightsaber stuff and basically do episode 7-9 all over again or present aliens, blasters and maybe one shot of a lightsaber? I dont know what most of the fans want.

8,In defense of Jedi appearing after Order 66,1600476423,"Something that was pointed out when I was working on my busy job of surfing mindlessly through r/swrpg was how many Jedi and Force Sensitives that are introduced as a consequence of the RPG experience. No matter how terrible Order 66 was and how many died, there seemed to be no limit in the amount of Padawans/Knights that survived long enough to either be played by the players or train them, and by extension how few Force Sensitives were caught by the Inquisitorious (not even getting into how many Jedi were *not* purged in favor of just making them Inquisitors). This is also not including all the Jedi even in the Disney canon who are now confirmed to have lived through Order 66, like Ahsoka Tano.

This leads to the obvious question that was raised in that post: ""Did Order 66 kill *anybody*?""

This was a good point. With so many canon Jedi characters wandering around post-New Order, it seems strange why Order 66 was so devastating to the point where by the time of the OT, only Luke, Yoda, and Obi-Wan were left it seemed.

However as I thought about it, it kind of made a bit of sense. Here was what I came to the conclusion of:

&gt;perhaps Order 66's most damaging effect (besides killing most Jedi and the Jedi Council along with many masters) was destroying the foundations of the Jedi Order and locking down the Temple.  
&gt;  
&gt;Without the Temple as a main home base, the Jedi became a diaspora, with no unified center to regroup and fight back (and if such a place was beginning to form, Vader and the Inquisitorius would learn of it and kill them like they did at the Temple). Not to mention the Archives being lost/intentionally destroyed (and Jocasta failing to back them up like she planned) caused much of their accumulated knowledge to be lost.  
&gt;  
&gt;While there could be many survivors, they've been spread thin over an entire *galaxy* and cannot do more than go on adventures and help people along the way without attracting unwanted attention. It's only when the Rebellion defeats the Empire, creates the New Republic, and Luke restores the Jedi Order when the remnants of the Jedi can come out of hiding and congregate once more.

Hence, this is why in EotE/AoR/F&amp;D, you can be a Force Sensitive character without breaking the lore and downgrading Luke's importance in the story. At the end of the day, people want to be a space samurai wizard and fight an evil Empire just like in the movies, and there has to be precedent for that to happen.

This is pretty much all I had to say on it. Let me know what you think.

87,"Theory: Anakin wasn't the Chosen one, Palpatine was.",1600454803,"**First off, I'm aware this is stupid and not canon, but what the hell, I enjoyed making it.**

The prophecy of the chosen one was never shown in the movies, but appeared in a canon book: *“A Chosen One shall come, born of no father, and through him will ultimate balance in the Force be restored.”*

\*(As for the part about ""born of no father"", in canon, we know nothing about Palpatine's family. What we do know is that Plagueis was a master of manipulating the force... including the ability to create life. It would have been simple for him to create a child using the force. Plus, prophecies are notorious for being super easy to misinterpret because of some random BS symbolism)

At first look, this definitely seems to be Anakin: No dad, eventually restores balance by defeating Palpatine. Yes, Palpatine did return, but because of Anakin's sacrifice, he'd lost almost all of his power, and was defeated easily, never managing to regain anywhere near the influence and power he'd had before.

However, if you look at it, Anakin never truly brought balance. The Jedi all assumed the prophecy meant the destruction of the Sith, but we learn from the Mortis gods that balance *includes* the Sith. Only light or only dark is still unbalanced. Look at the Jedi Order during their height, when they believed the Sith destroyed: They had grown complacent and bureaucratic, ignoring clear and obvious evils like slavery. They were also incredibly paranoid, cutting out any Jedi who they felt got close to the dark side, and shutting Jedi off from any kind of emotion. They were willing to remove Yoda from the Jedi Council just because he suggested that their understanding of the force was flawed. During the Clone Wars, they became generals, and ended up perpetuating a violent and destructive war, one of their greatest failures. Then, look at the Jedi after Order 66: The few that were left became far stronger of Jedi, in combat, but also in the Force. Obi Wan and Yoda learned to become force ghosts, a previously unexplored technique. Ahsoka, Kanan, and Ezra served the people as a Jedi should, fighting to protect civilians from the Empire. Ezra also opened up ""The World Between Worlds, an ancient Jedi location that had been locked for millenia. They also became far more emotionally healthy Jedi, able to form solid bonds with others without fear of attachment. The same goes for Cal Kestis, who was able to fight off the dark side in himself, and become a far stronger Jedi. Importantly, when Cal meditates on whether or not restarting the Jedi is a good idea, he eventually decides not to. Because the Jedi were put in a situation where they were no longer on top, they were forced to become better, and reinvent what it meant to be Jedi. There's a saying that ""Only steel can sharpen steel"". Palpatine dragged the Jedi out of the stagnation they'd been in by forcing them to confront an enemy that was stronger than them.

Anakin never really did any of that on his own: Palpatine guided him to the dark side, and guided him to kill the Jedi. In addition, Palpatine was the one to actually plan and execute Order 66, without which, Anakin would have had no hope of defeating the Jedi Order. Then, when Anakin ""killed"" Palpatine, he not only failed to do it successfully, *he failed to bring balance*. If he had succeeded, the Sith would be wiped out, meaning that the Galaxy would still be unbalanced. Palpatine was the one to keep himself alive, thus, maintaining balance. Palpatine then died in TROS, but he left behind thousands of Sith cult members, as well as stashes of Dark Side artifacts and holocrons across the galaxy. He made sure the Sith would survive forever, constantly being there to balance out the Jedi, and prevent the Jedi from stagnating again",StarWars,EquivalentInflation,False,/r/StarWars/comments/ivbzwe/theory_anakin_wasnt_the_chosen_one_palpatine_was/

21,Rogue One is the best modern Star Wars movie,1600445371,"I rewatched Rogue One last night, and I love it more than ever. It's such a great Star Wars movie. The only scene I would quibble with was the Bor Gullet scene, which seemed entirely unnecessary and only there to check the box of ""weird alien monster in a Star Wars movie"".

It felt like an actual Star Wars. Like, a war movie. I really dug the jungle setting for the final act, felt almost like a Vietnam war movie. And the Rebels were rebels, or, from a certain point of view, terrorists, and they fought as such.

The space battle happening at the same time is one of the best in Star Wars, perhaps only topped by the end of ROTJ. I loved the use of the hammerhead cruiser to win the day, sort of (sorry, most of them died).

Most of them died - another unique twist to a Star Wars movie. None of our leads got out it alive, but they all went to their deaths willingly, fighting for a cause they believed in (I loved that it became ""FOR JEDHA!"").

Another cool thematic battle I loved was the initial fighting on Jedha - which felt very much like Iraq/Afghanistan circa 2005 or so. Saw's warriors are even dressed mostly for the part.

I loved that this movie acknowledge the prequels in a way the sequels did not. Jimmy Smits showing up was such an awesome, surprising moment. And sad, because you know he too is about to die.

The movie felt like the predecessor to a New Hope in so many ways, especially including actual footage from ANH of Red and Gold leader. Overall the 70's aesthetic they maintained throughout the movie was so well done. It's a wise choice I think to maintain the same looking technology as the original movie, rather than trying to update it for modern sensibilities.

And then of course, that last scene. The only lightsaber in the entire movie, used in a terrifying fashion. Vader has never seemed scarier.",StarWars,MoreGull,False,/r/StarWars/comments/iv8zeu/rogue_one_is_the_best_modern_star_wars_movie/

92,Luke was the villain in the final battle between himself and his father.,1600383475,"So after reading an article about how  palpatines intentions in SWE6 were for luke to kill him in anger to posess his body.  This got me to thinking and developing this theory.

Given the zombie emperors intent in 9, and his similar behavior in 6, its reasonable to establish palapatines motive is having  someone kill him in anger (Luke in 6, Rey in 9) thus allowing him to move into the one that killed him.  I just want to establish that motive quickly.
That being established heres MY theory.
Vader turned back to the light sooner than we think and that commitment back to the light began when Luke chose to reject him, and took a suicide leap at Bespin.  
The reborn Anakin, having achieved balance in the force, then formulated one final brilliant plan in meantime to not only complete Lukes training as a Jedi, Kill off the Sith for good, but be able to give Luke a safe taste of the dark side without having him turn to the Sith, thus an attempt to give Luke an understanding of what the balance of the force actually is. He kept up his identity as Vader to keep up appearances as openly opposing palpatine would be sure to fail for him... Everything that transpired from that point did so to Anakins design... Not palpatines.  This was Anakin Skywalkers final mission.  He intended for Luke to defeat him in anger in front of the emperor, show Luke the folly of embracing the Dark Side fully without embracing the light, and have the emperor distracted by rage so he in turn could kill him and not have his spirit pass on.
There is alot of Evidence to support this in 6.

Anakin playing Vader is far more merciful in 6 than at ANY OTHER TIME we see Vader.  Not once do you see him torment, force choke, or execute his officers for failures/delays.  He ALLOWS the rebel ship to land on the forest moon because he wants them to succeed and he wants Luke to play into the emperors game...  He NEEDS Luke to give into his anger and have that turn to the dark side in order for his plan and overall training to work... Anakin is clearly able to use the force to shield his feelings and intent from the emperor without the emperor suspecting because the emperor continues to feel the dark side is still flowing through Anakin and dismisses any conflict of light from Anakin as lingering feelings for his son...  The emperor not being able to sense Luke presence is INTENTIONAL, because Anakin is clouding the emperors ability to sense him out.  Anakin is only telling Palpatine about Lukes presence on Endor with precise timing to push palpatine into playing an unknowing role in his plan.  He takes advantage of palpatines greed and desire to hop into a shiny fresh powerful force user body...
When Anakin talks to Luke on Endor, the moment Luke evoked his real name, Anakin snaps back ""That name, no longer has any meaning for me"". This was said to keep Luke ignorant to his plan and to keep up appearances around the troopers.  He wanted luke to think he was feeling conflict within...  It wasnt conflict.  It was BALANCE.
But at last the stage was set to execute the plan.  Anakin, Palpatine, and Luke ALONE...  Palpatine begins his gaslighting and goads Luke into channeling his anger and thus the Dark Side.  Anakin tells Luke it is pointless to resist these gaslighting attempts...  Showing Luke the death and destruction of his comrades Luke finally begins to cave to the pressure.  Just as Anakin had hoped. It was time to act...Luke takes a swing at Palpatine and Anakin quickly saves Luke by stopping Lukes lightsaber from doing the dark deed.  The Emperor, having seen his own plan sabotaged changes strategy.  He now wants Luke to win the contest, and to see his former apprentice fall at the hands of his own son before reinitializing his old plan to have Luke kill him.  
Now theres one big snag to both plans at this point.  Luke backs away from his anger and goes into hiding.  The only one Luke wants to fight is palpatine and Anakin is preventing him from doing that. Anakin feeling this from luke gives his son one final push in the form of threatening his Sister.  And boy does it work.  Luke channels the dark side and unleashes the beast on Anakin.  As anakin lays in defeat you see a shot of lukes face where his eyes have a yellow tinting to them.. Anakin sits defeated, as he planned, and Luke then sees the folly of fully embracing the dark side and rejects this anger to only incur the wrath of the emperor who doesnt take not getting his way too well.  Now it could be said Vader was in conflict trying to decide to help while the Emperor was tormenting Luke, but I actually believe he was looking back and forth to see if the Emperor was distracted enough to move in and make a grab.   And sure enough Palpatine loves the rare treat of personally tormenting a Jedi.  Anakins move was then made, Palpatine was thrown down a shaft, and with that, Anakin restored the balance in the force, and tried to leave behind a balanced force user in his son...   Until he didnt because of cloning...

84,[ROTS spoilers] Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Sidious? - it feels like Sheev is the main character of Skywalker Saga.,1600356538,"It feels like after their conclusion the three Star Wars trilogies were just a story of a very powerful Sith self-containing himself and bringing balance to the Force. We see him at a very beginning of Phantom Menace and at the end of The Rise of Skywalker we see his clone's daughter being a powerful vessel of the Force in Galaxy. 

In current canon he's not absent at all even during sequels, since we know that he controls Snoke. So he's pretty much a persistent threat from moment we see him in Phantom Menace till the end of Skywalker Saga.

Hell, you can even describe Sheev's role as more prominent. There were suggestions that he is Anakin's creator, further fueled by a graphic novel. While this is open to speculation, he surely did create Darth Vader and Kylo Ren.

I think with just a bit of rewriting the final movie could really solidified Darth Sidious as a villain. They could even go full Darth Sidious is a creator of Skywalkers, which would really make Rey a Skywalker. I can have some head canon fun and consider Sheev a main hero but I know that this was probably not writer's goal to make him more important than Skywalkers.",StarWars,Sumorisha,False,/r/StarWars/comments/iulpjk/rots_spoilers_did_you_ever_hear_the_tragedy_of/

46,can someone please explain to me how luke escaped cloud city?,1600336505,"so i was re-watching ESB and im not sure if i missed something but when luke falls down from vader, why does he just magically get sucked into a hole? like, what caused that, why didn't he just keep falling? how does he go into the tube? and even then, how is it the exact place that luke lands on the tube, opens up, why does it open up?

I'm fine with convenient things in star wars happening if it serves the story but... this just seems.... very overly specific and extremely extremely convenient if it all happened by chance that he magically gets sucked into a tube for no apparent reason whilst falling, then the exact place he lands in the tube is the exact location a hatch is, which just so happens to open at the right time for luke fall out of it, conveniently next to a pole for him to cling onto for dear life...

so did I miss something or is that part of the ending of ESB really wack?",StarWars,NoNameMike92,False,/r/StarWars/comments/iugff1/can_someone_please_explain_to_me_how_luke_escaped/

I was wondering about the ethical considerations of taking such small children from their families. How does that work? 

Sometimes they are rescuing a child from abusive circumstances, but what happens when a force-sensitive child is discovered in a non-abusive family. How do the Jedi persuade the family to give them the child? Do they offer money? Try to persuade the family that it's for the good of the child? What if the family says no? Is mental manipulation used to get them to agree? 

Do the Jedi follow some ethical guidelines when it comes to that kind of situations? Is it explored anywhere in canon or Legends?

55,Star Wars as a franchise is bigger and better than Star Wars the OT. CMV,1600329308,"Change my view.

Star Wars as a franchise is better than just Star Wars The Original Trilogy.

While the OT is what I grew up on pre-1999, and those films were already cinema classics by that time...

The franchise has done so well that it has become a phenomenon beyond the OT.

By prequel standards, Ewan McGregor has basically usurped the role of Obi-Wan from Sir Alec Guinness.  

The Clone Wars has been universally praised and rightfully so.

Rogue Squadron is easily in the top five of the twelve theatrical films.  Sure, subjective, but let’s not kid ourselves.  A thrilling storyline, a fantastic villain, and at the end, a solid 30 seconds of fan service that is well deserved.

Currently while people are mumbling about the final entry to the so-called Skywalker Saga, other peeps are HYPED and EXCITED for The Mandalorian season 2.

I dunno.  While none of this could be possible without the OT, the fact remains that the franchise itself has outgrown the original trilogy and good on them for doing so!",StarWars,MRF1982,False,/r/StarWars/comments/iuf18y/star_wars_as_a_franchise_is_bigger_and_better/

It seems like they missed the most basic of filmmaking lessons.

Even if you have new directors coming in for each installment, you can still ensure they stick largely to a pre-planned narrative. Is there any plausible reason why they would have chosen to go down this path, or is it sheer incompetence?

85,"Return of the Jedi is two of the same movies in one, kind of - meant as humor",1600312430,"Luke goes through two slightly similar strings of events at the beginning with Jabba The Hutt and the Emperor, later.

His starting objective is to rescue / save someone - Han Solo, Anakin Skywalker

Shows up overconfident, has some banter with the main adversary (with family member present and observing - Leia and Vader), and soon realizes that he's in over his head - the Rancor monster encounter and failed banter with the Emperor. I think he tried to used the Jedi mind trick on the Emperor with the 'Your overconfidence is your weakness' line. Also a failed attempt with Jabba.

Calls lightsaber to himself and fighting / dueling ensues

Family member kills main adversary - Leia and Anakin

My all-time top favourite Star Wars episode is The Last Jedi; I enjoy how deep in the lore Rian Johnson has gone to develop his movie. He didn't follow what the fans wanted as seen in Legends he went with how George would have seen mostly with Luke Skywalker; I hated what I've heard of Legends. Yes, I've never read any Legends book past the Thrawn trilogy or the Bane trilogy I learned all I have from YouTube and the Wookieepedia. I gained many detractions from Legend banner mainly the power climbing and the Yuzang Vong and the goddess named Abeloth.

89,What I think Disney is going to do next and how the Mandalorian plays a huge role,1600310269,"There's been a lot of rumors about Disney somehow decanonizing the Sequel Trilogy. For better or for worse I don't think this is going to happen. Disney has sunk too much time, money, and effort into them and won't make them canon. 

What I **DO** think is going to happen is that they are going to explain away and ignore these three movies by using some of the more popular portions of their New Canon to retcon a lot of the issues with the Sequels and Sequel canon. 

**SPOILERS AHEAD FOR THE CANON THRAWN TRILOGY, MANDALORIAN CAST REVEALS, AND REBELS YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED**

The best part of the Disney canon is Thrawn. I never read the original Thrawn books (though they are on my to do list) but I have read the new canon Thrawn books and he is by far my favorite character in all of Star Wars. In Rebels he was ""dumbed down"" a bit, but that I'm chalking up to plot armor for the heroes. 

**QUICK SET UP**

In *Thrawn: Treason* we see him work for the benefit of the Empire and the Chiss Ascendancy by eliminating Grysk interlopers and a saboteur for project ""Stardust"" fairly quickly. While eliminating the rebels is his primary directive for the Empire, his overarching goal is to foster stability in the galaxy to prevent it from falling prey to the Grysk who are slowly making their way into Imperial space. Should the Grysk get a foothold in the worlds under Imperal control, they would be nigh unstoppable. 

A wrench was thrown in his plan when he and Ezra were taken by the Hyperspace whales during the final battle of Lothal. We have no idea where they ended up or what they have been up to since the events of *Rebels*. What we do know is that Sabine and Ahsoka were tasked with finding Ezra after the Empire fell. 

*The Mandalorian* has casted a live action Ahsoka, and rumors of a live action Sabine Wren have been floating around since the Ahsoka casting. Where would these characters be if not searching for Ezra and by proxy Thrawn? 

**THEORY TIME**

My theory is that they are prepping for an explanation of why the New Republic was so easily squished, and why the First Order was able to rise to prominence under their nose, and the threat of the First Order was not taken seriously. My idea is that during the course of *The Mandalorian* and perhaps another Disney+ exclusive TV show, we will see that the Grysk took the fall of the Empire as a signal to invade. Not in large numbers, but in increasingly bold strokes until they recognize that the New Republic is not strong enough yet to fight off an invasion and they start bringing in bigger numbers and stronger forces. 

The Chiss contact the New Republic and the two of them have to start working together to fight off this horde with everything they have. This is where the cast of the Mandalorian comes into play. Luke is trying to rebuild the Jedi Order (as best he can) and is trying his best to keep the Jedi out of war as much as possible to avoid the mistakes of the Jedi of the Republic where they were generals instead of peacekeepers. Similar to *KOTOR*, a faction of Luke's students will want to act and he will let them leave. 

These core students and the cast of *The Mandalorian* along with Ezra and Thrawn (who have reached an understanding while stuck in deep space together) will have to work side by side with the New Republic and the Chiss Defense Fleet to fight off the Grysk as best they can. Meanwhile, the First Order rises up like in the Sequel Trilogy and we get the Sequels happening in an entirely different sector of the galaxy than the Grysk War. 

That's my idea and I'm not sure if this has been proposed before, but I would love to see this become a thing.",StarWars,Vrael22,False,/r/StarWars/comments/iuamk0/what_i_think_disney_is_going_to_do_next_and_how/

Anyway, I noticed one of the year 7s had a Lego minifigure of Poe Dammeron (sorry if I spelled that wrong) on his bag, as one of the keychains. I asked one of the kids if it was their bag and they said it was. And so I asked ""Do you like the sequels?"" And he said yes. Then I said ""That's okay that you like them. They're just not my cup of tea."" And that's where the conversation ended. And that's okay. I'm not gonna put someone down for liking the sequels. I may not like them myself for many reasons, but I know many people that hate them because they hate anything Disney has done to Star Wars. I will admit, I still like The Force Awakens as a movie. If it was just that one movie, it wouldn't be too bad. But then we saw where it went, and yeah...I don't like how it turned out. But I wanna talk to more people who like the sequels.

If theoretically a civilization as advanced as the cosmic AC from the last question came up with a solution, perhaps the force would be it.

This would explain the connection to living beings as well as the surrounding reality itself.

The advanced civilization likely used their advanced technology to biologically alter evolution itself, allowing for everything to be linked up to a universe wide system or quantum field.

I was wondering if it would make sense story/roleplay-wise for a sith to romance a bounty hunter? I can imagine sithXsith romances don’t work due to power struggles, but I wanted to hear what you guys think.

I kinda feel Pascal on this, and I can imagine his frustration about the writers not budging. So here we go:

Loved The Mandalorian. Super fun. COVID times led me to finally go back and watch both Clone Wars and Rebels. Lots of Mandalorian mythos in those (really, some of the best eps of both series). So, my no-duh question: Why does Mando insist on never removing his helmet? Mandalorians of all stripes remove their helmets in canon ALL THE TIME, including people like Vizla, who is clearly hardcore old-school.

Does anyone know what Disney's doing about this? I mean it was released quite a long time ago and it's pretty insane.

Just a button that reorders the episodes. Go to [this link](https://help.disneyplus.com/csp?id=disney_product_feedback) and send in feedback for them to make this option available.
