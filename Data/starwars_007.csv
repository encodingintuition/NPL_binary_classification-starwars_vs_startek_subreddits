2,Is Star Wars a Cosmic Horror Story? (I hope I'm wrong),1595900090,"&amp;#x200B;

Okay, up front? Fanfic writer here. And I got myself into a bit of a corner. As much as I think the universe is a lot of fun to write and play with, there's a lot that troubles me. 

Start with David Brin's [detailed and unflattering takedown of the GFFA](https://www.davidbrin.com/nonfiction/starwars1.html) and its themes (see Star Wars on Trial).  *The right to rule is inherited. Justified human emotions can turn a good person evil. Elites have an inherent right to arbitrary rule; common citizens needn't be consulted. They may only choose which elite to follow.* Those certainly are not pleasant ideals, but we do see a lot of casual elitism; feudal type societies (Queens, Kings, Viceroys...even in Republic societies), very little in the way of a middle class, democracy presented as corrupted failure (the Republic Senate) , and the Jedi are presented as the moral center of the universe when they've had some dodgy policies (like child conscription) and less than moral actions. (The Clone army was arguably slavery)

Also? Not sure who here took KOTOR 2 for a spin, but [Kreia has some insights on the Force](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z0S0Z8lUTg&amp;t=1286s)and how it works that...Well, I think she's an unpleasant old bag, but it's hard to argue that she's wrong about her heretical and brutal view of the Force. The way she sees it, the Force is a cruel entity that empowers a handful at the cost of their free will, manipulating its chosen few into eternal conflict (with the Force manipulating them so they can't see any other options), while the majority have no real say in matters, reduced to being dragged into saber-swinger drama and tossed into the proverbial meat grinder and the Force merrily plays both sides to keep feeding on all the blood. Legions of Lettow, the Rakata, Exar Kun, Revan, Vitiate, Bane, Palpatine...the name changes, but it always plays out the same way; Sith kill Jedi, Jedi kill Sith, one side fights the other into a handful of survivors who rally and fight back, beating the other side into a handful of cornered survivors, who rally and fight back...Over and Over again. 

It's terrifying, it's disturbing. It turns a grand cosmic adventure setting into a bleak and hopeless Cosmic Horror tale of two groups of cultists fighting eternal war to feed a gluttonous, bloodthirsty god.  And yet I can't unsee it. 

I'd love for these folks to be completely wrong. I know already that Official LucasArts Doctrine (TM) is that the Light is the Right way and that the Dark is some perversion. Unfortunately? It's been hard to try and see the Force as anything other than this manipulative and cruel entity pushing sentient life into unending conflict to feed on the resulting death and pain. And for fanfic purposes, I have a couple of Force Sensitives who are scared out of their minds and really would like to hand them better news than *""Good news, you get magic powers and are among the Only People Who Matter! Bad news, you lose your free will and will be sending thousands of lives into blood sacrifice to feed the entity that .""*",StarWars,Allronix1,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hz5h8g/is_star_wars_a_cosmic_horror_story_i_hope_im_wrong/

12,Vader turning back to the light and sensing Ahsoka,1595898199,"I don’t know if this is an original idea but I’ve never seen it before so I’ll just type out an idea that’s been running through my head.

Anakin and Ahsoka had a force bond, where they could sense each other, but then Ahsoka couldn’t sense him when he turned to the dark side, right?

So what if when he turns back, the bond suddenly returns, and we get a scene of Ahsoka suddenly stopping what she’s doing, and whispering “Anakin”. 

He does the same, and whispers “Ahsoka” while Luke is taking him to the ship. However Luke doesn’t know what that means since he doesn’t know about her yet, but this prompts him to later search for her and meet her.

I don’t know if the force bond would actually work like that and return right away, but it makes me happy to think about. 

Bonus: Vader carries Ahsoka’s padawan beads, and he gives them to Luke (or Luke finds them). He then gives them to Ahsoka when they meet. It would be heartwarming, and maybe also symbolic that she can again be a “student” and learn from Anakin through his force ghost.",StarWars,lioness191,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hz4zi4/vader_turning_back_to_the_light_and_sensing_ahsoka/

Star Wars obviously has no intergalactic travel (from their galaxy I mean, I’m aware intergalactic beings have visited their galaxy before), and they seem to have stalled technologically, several times. 

Over all Star Wars’ galaxy just seems much more despotic, dystopian, stagnant. I do not know much about how long the galaxy has been active, as in regular interplanetary travel.

60,Simple ways to improve the sequel trilogy (not that its bad),1595886244,"Hello, watching how the sequels tore at the star wars community. This has been very disheartening to a new star wars fan ( relative as im 15 yrs old). Althpugh I am very optimistic about lucasfilm actually taking time to plan and sort out what they want to do on the movie side of things, with stellar directors like taika waititi, and on the tv side of things, the GOAT dave filoni and jon favreau being given bigger roles within Lucasfilm. 

If I could make small changes to the sequel trilogy,  here is what I would do to make them less divisive, and better movies (IMO)

TFA: 

The resistance doesn't exist, lea is in charge of the military branch of the new republic or a senator. 

This would allow for several scenes at Bosnian prime, and also give some much needed world building and would really get the tone of th he galaxy across, and make the conflict in the sequels less like the OT.  We can see a bit of the political side, and give hosnians destruction/capture some resinence for the audience, so basically the resistance is now just a part of the new republic, stationed away from the hosnian system, and maybe join in the battle to fight for the planet before leading into TLJ?

Also, starkiller base  isnt a thing, or is an energy generator for a huge fleet or giant ship yard that a team has to destroy. The whole planet killing weapon has been done to death by now. 

TLJ:

Change Luke's arc a tad. 

So obviously lukes arc was a big point of contention for star wars fans, and I would improve it by doing the inverse of what happened in the film. Whereas in the film, luke tries to preemptively stop kylo after seeing a vision, in my version, he let's it grow and fester, thinking he can help kylo control it, until eventually kylo kills his students and ruins the temple. 

This change would give luke a very similar arc, but it would keep it true to the core character and not be as divisive. 

Poe and  finn stay on the ship (rose still exists and is present) 

So this is kinda major. But I think the chemistry between those two actors is too good. 

Poe can help find realize why he should fight for the resistance. And finn can help poe realize that war isnt glamorous or good. 

 I rly like TLJ as it is. 

TROS: 

Rose is a spy for the first order....

This completely justifies holdos whole ""not trusting anyone"" thing. Retroactively and it would just be a fun twist. 


Basically TROS would become duel for the fates...


TROS. Actually I would just take out the fake out deaths and extend the run time, give it some room to  breath. Ben would be saved, but would live and have to actually go and stop the first order on solo missions trying to redeem himself in the final scene.


So  overall, we just streamline it a bit, add more worldbuilding,slightly change a few arcs.

64,The star wars oscars,1595885906,"These were my choices and reasons

Best scene for me is vaders first breath, the silence is chilling and the breath gives me goose bumps every time. The scene symbolises the death of anakin and true birth of vader and the shattered puppet that he has become until his redemption. The tragedy of darth plaguise the wise was my second choice but darth vaders first breath is basically the tragedy remade, its almost ironi

My choice for best performance was sam witwer as darth maul, he expresses total madnes, loss, hatred and fear in a chilling way that nearly makes the animation seem lacking att times, for me sam witwer embodied the voice of maul in a fenomenal way.

For Best film i voted revenge of the sith, a few scenes had questionable acting but except for that the special effects still look incredible and it delivered a dark finish to the prequel trilogy, i also grew upp with the clone wars and the prequel memes and i have there for always appreciated it for its positives instead of its flaws.

Best tv series was clone wars, i cant be bothered to explain why because if you don’t know why, well then you are lost.

Best lightsaber duel for me was darth vader vs luke return of the jedi. Its still chilling as you see dsrth vader playing mind games with his son, taunting him until he breaks and turns, the tension as you see luke closely walking the thin line between the light and dark side of the force makes for a duel that is better than others thanks to the emotions. Even tho other duels have better choreography.

Best jedi for me is plo koon, i dont have good reasons i just like him, the best i could come up with is the way he values people ans how he remains calm and trusts the force like a good jedi

Best villain for me is darth maul. Darth vader to me is something else completely, he is both villain and hero so it didnt feel right to just call him a villain. Maul on the other hand seeks power, revenge and is fueled by hatred but also fear. To see someone lose his place as the apprentice of the most powerfull being, to be cast out on his own as he seeks revenge makes him a good protagonist of the evil.

Best score for me is duel of fates, because it really was the duel of fates, it truly defined qui gon, anakin, maul and obi wans fate in one single duel and the music delivers and incredible score to it. 

Ewan mcgregor is the best actor, he delivers his role extremely well, ns carrie fisher does the same for actress, the last choices were either simple (such as r2d2 for best droid) and im to lazy to explain reasons and i dont think anyone actuallt cares about my opinion anyways but i was bores and wrote this post in my sloppy English",StarWars,Xplt21,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hz1hq8/the_star_wars_oscars/

68,"All three trilogies, from a certain perspective",1595885450,"I’m currently rewatching all the Star Wars films (excluding Rogue One &amp; Solo) and I’ve found the more I watch them, the more I like them. I find that I even repeat certain lines of dialogue as they come, some lines I’ve memorised such as “I am the senate.” and “Join me, and together we can rule the galaxy as father and son.” And “The droid we seek is aboard the Millennium Falcon, in the hands of your father, Han Solo.” I’m a fan of all three trilogies so I want to share what I liked about each of them, having watched them again, and I’ll start with the original trilogy. 

The original trilogy had one of my favourite moments in Star Wars, the big moment: “No, I am your father.” This scene was executed really well, in my opinion. It wasn’t shocking for me because I was made aware of it not long after I discovered Star Wars. But I still said ‘dun dun dun!’ Out loud. One of my favourite things about the original trilogy is C3P0 and R2D2, my favourite droids. They were two characters I had one of the strongest emotional connections to. 

The prequel trilogy had (with the most scenes for him) my favourite character in Star Wars, (no, not Anakin) the Emperor. I loved how he controlled the galaxy simply by using his voice, manipulating people to do what he says. My favourite fight scene was (no, not Anakin vs Obi-wan, sorry) in Attack of the Clones where the Jedi fought off the droids. I just loved watching all (or most, at least) of the Jedi come together and fight off the droids, then the republic comes in to aid them, loved it! I get goosebumps every time. 

I really like the sequel trilogy, one of the reasons because the cgi is modern. And that just makes the films look beautiful. The Force Awakens has some of my favourite shots. One of them being the tie fighters flying toward the camera with the sun in the background. 

A New Hope is one of the reasons why I love The Force Awakens so much. This is just me, I’m not making an argument. They both had planet destroying weapons in them, except Starkiller base was obviously a much bigger and far more powerful version. They basically gave the Death Star an upgrade. I know a lot of people hated The Force Awakens because it copied A New Hope, but that just makes me love both films even more. 

I’m not sure I have a favourite Star Wars film, but the ones I like the most are, and I know different people will rip me apart, but: Revenge of the Sith, Rogue One, Solo, and The Rise of Skywalker, all for different reasons.",StarWars,DarthNexun,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hz1ckk/all_three_trilogies_from_a_certain_perspective/

23,Where do we draw the line at treating Star Wars as a 'way of life'?,1595876516,"I kinda want to have a serious discussion about this because despite how passionate people are about this franchise, it's gotten to the point where it feels like the vocality over the stuff people hate about new Star Wars is creatively restricting the folks over at Lucasfilm. The Rise of Skywalker might've just been the most reactionary film I have ever seen in an established franchise, as it felt too reliant on trying to please as many people who bickered about TLJ, that it could never function properly as either a concluding chapter, an addition to a trilogy or a standalone film. I've also heard online that people want figures like Jon Favreau and Dave Filoni to become heads at Lucasfilm purely because they worked on a single Star Wars show, without understanding that the role of a creative at a company is completely different from managing the general day-to-day operations outside supervising projects. I honestly feel like the mentality of treating this franchise like it's some sort of transcendant experience rather than just a film franchise has really damaged the general reputation of both the franchise and how people percieve the fanbase, as there is a reason ""Nobody hates Star Wars more than Star Wars fans"" has become somewhat of a synonymous phrase with the community when talked about from other points of view. I love Star Wars but I think looking at it as more than just a film like so many people do is actively hurting the series' reputation because whenever one or multiple people add new things to the canon people are suddenly opposed to it as if it's a big change to a religious text. I feel like in recent times Star Wars hasn't been allowed to be as imaginative as it used to be without some sort of backlash because people hold the other films so dearly to their hearts that they'll go as far as harrassing actors, sending threats to studio heads and even taking the words of YouTubers who have no credibility or reputation whatsoever when they say Disney is going to retcon the trilogy they hate so much. I feel like it's time for a lot of people to accept that Star Wars is like any other film franchise that will have its ups and downs, and that whenever it does stumble it shouldn't be as overdramatized as it tends to get. It was a game changer back then and it still is now, but a lot of people take it several steps too far and its really tarnished my enjoyment when talking about Star Wars or even how I feel like it's impossible to enjoy certain films without a collective hivemind breathing down your neck whenever you express an opinion.",StarWars,MyMouthisCancerous,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hyyid6/where_do_we_draw_the_line_at_treating_star_wars/

41,Can we talk about Leia in RotJ?,1595874012,"Ok let me preface this by saying RotJ is my hands down favorite Star Wars movie, but I was day dreaming today and a thought crossed my mind I really wanted to talk about with people.



Leia's reveal and reaction to being a Skywalker is INCREDIBLY hand waved. And it really only explained how acceptable this hand wave is by ""the force"". Which I get the force is a popular catch all in writing for Star wars. But like dude:

Yoda is like there's another Skywalker, and Ben adds that he had a twin sister separated at birth, Luke immediately is like ""It's Leia"" Ben practically looks at him and responds ""yep""

Like that alone I'm feeling is a tremendous leap, but you know force, insight, yadda yadda. This wasn't what got me.


What got me was Leia's reaction, when Luke confides to get that Vader us his father she's blown away, but then when he tells her their siblings she's just like ""huh..... Yeah I feel like I knew that.""


Like this is HEAVY news, in that one statement she learned a tremendous amount of truths:

1. She's adopted

2. Her enemy is her birth father

3. Hey Birth father assisted with the genocide if her friends family and home

4. She has a brother

5. While not as strong as her feelings with Han she did harbor feelings for her brother.

6. She's capable of space magic


These are all pretty heavy truth bombs dropped on her, and her response was pretty muted and tame.

 I was hoping you guys could help me with a question I have.  Are there any descriptions of Miraluka sight in the lore? I’m writing a fic and for years I thought it was something along the lines of the black and white with auras that Visas teaches in KOTOR II. On a recent replay though she mentions that what she taught is not the full sight of her people, I must have missed that before. I found an image on the wiki but that appears more or less the same as KOTOR II.

Being an OT fan and having a ""meh"" reaction to the prequels, this series has totally given me a 180˚ outlook on that portion of the saga.

Obi-Wan likewise receives a great backstory boost, making him an even more engaging character.

But Ahsoka was really the cherry on top. I watched all of Rebels when that came out. She was good in that but the way her character was crafted in Clone Wars made her one of the best characters in the entire saga.

95,Guys... I've changed.,1595855611,"So I am an unabashed Prequel Hater.  Not aggressively but heavily in the ""these movies are flat awful and not worth my time"" camp.  

Anyway... Me, my wife and my boys have been binging The Clone Wars and we're approaching the Siege of Mandalore arc.  My sons until we started watching the TCW were casual star wars fans and I never really pushed them into it because I wanted them to find their own happiness and not just mimic my own... so they've never seen any of the live action movies other than the sequel trilogy because theose are the ones they wanted to see.

As much as I resisted it, I told them to get a better context of the Siege of Mandalore arc we should watch Revenge of the Sith so they could get the whole picture of Order 66 and Anakin's turn etc.  

I fire up Revenge of the Sith for the first time in over a decade and we watched it.  

There are moments that are still cringe.  Struggling to smile at the parts that are supposed to be dramatic but have been warped into memes has kinda flattened a few of the powerful moments, but with the full context of The Clone Wars in our pocket and the ability to look past some of the things I know would be disappointing I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and I never thought I would ever again.

I admit, that without the wider context of TCW I still think ROTS would fall flat, but having invested so much time and emotion into the character of Anakin Skywalker and Clone Wars Obi Wan the movie feels entirely different now.

It doesn't redeem Eps 1 and 2 for me, but I will no longer viciously resist Episode 3.  My boys loved it.   My oldest literally gasped in shock at the end of the Obi Anakin duel and to be able to give my kids that kind of reaction really put the entire thing into focus. 

Just wanted to share.  I hope my story here can open the eyes of both PT and ST bashers to give them another shot with an open mind.  Last night opened a door I thought long closed in my love of the franchise.

And in Rebels S3 E15 “Trails of the darksaber” Sabine releases all her pain from being castes away from her Mandalorian family, her family chose a government power over their own blood out of fear, they cast her out cause she wanted to do what was right for her people and no one listened. And All throughout S3 Agent Kallis went from a brainwashed imperial into someone who truly looked at the facts and realized he was on the wrong side.

When i intially watched the clone wars and Rebels I didn’t take its messages to heart, but i have matured since i began my Chronological/canon rewatch and a lot of the deeper themes hit really hard, I recommend everyone to watch both shows and each movie with an open mind and reflect the messages portrayed in the shows and movies to real life it is shocking what you can learn.",StarWars,BlakeKevin,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hymwlu/rebels_is_marketed_and_called_a_kids_show_as_was/

As most people say, one of the worst thing about the sequels (especially both of J.J.’s movies) is the lack of originality and copying of what happened in the original trilogy.

Like I just hate how it ends the exact same way as Darth Vader. That Kylo Ren finally goes good and then dies immediately after.

It’s like they feel “because of all the bad he has done, he MUST die.” Like, why couldn’t he had paid the price for has past actions by using his powers to help others or something along those lines, instead of dying. Feels like Disney basically had decided “if you were ever bad, you have to die no matter what, because that’s what the originals did.”

I also just really love the idea of him being in the middle, like a gray Jedi.

I think TLJ was executed quite well generally (not that it doesn’t have problems of course) but even if you disagree I don’t think it’s controversial to say it had an interesting concept. The prequels tried to tell the story of how a democratic republic can be overturned by fascism, and that’s a super interesting story even if it was executed poorly. I think that inherent property of the prequel era will keep people coming back to it and appreciating it, even with its flaws. And I believe in the coming years the same thing will happen with TLJ, especially since it’s sequel era brethren are lacking those interesting ideas and themes and attempts to try new things instead focusing on comedy and action and nostalgia. I don’t think history will look very kindly on TFA and RoS, seeing them as blatant cash grabs banking on nostalgia (and I say that as someone who liked TFA) and while that still is true to some extent of TLJ it actually tries to be a good and memorable movie and be it’s own thing, not just a repeat of ANH or endgame.",StarWars,Crazyman_54,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hykx15/tlj_will_be_appreciated_the_same_way_in_the/

97,Revan is not a “gray Jedi”,1595806319,"I see this concept of revan come up a lot, especially in comment sections.

First of all, the concept of a gray Jedi should not exist, as cool as it is. It goes against what Lucas created and it’s commonly known that the dark side eventually takes over because it’s like a giant vacuum cleaner that sucks you in.

This is probably brought up because he mastered both sides of the force, but at separate times. 

He was a Jedi first, then he used the dark side and fully converted to the dark side in order to unite the galaxy against a greater threat(the true sith). He turned to the dark side to accomplish this, but doesn’t mean he was his old self when trying to achieve his goal. He kept himself from attaining too much power so as to not be consumed with the idea of power itself and not lose sight of his goal in uniting the galaxy. He was still very much a dark side user that was no longer a Jedi, because he either converted Jedi, or eliminated them.

The SWTOR MMO and the Revan Novel(complementary to SWTOR), give off examples where revan is able to use both sides of the force. I understand this is the EU cannon, but many consider the revan novel and the swtor game to be a very poor retcon and depiction of the original revan concept, it lacks proper wrightup. The KOTOR concept of revan make it so that revan adheres to either side rather than balance(which should not exist). This is the original concept that makes revan popular.

In any case, the original revan concept makes it clear that revan is NOT a “Gray Jedi”, as much as the MMO tries to Contort this concept.",StarWars,Kevin_Science,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hyh86h/revan_is_not_a_gray_jedi/

5,My Aunt’s Thoughts on Star Wars Movies (first time watcher),1595800437,"Special thanks to u/-GreggRulzOk- for the idea to share her thoughts. 

A few months back, I was staying with my aunt. She noticed how I own a lot of lightsabers, and how I mention Star Wars all the time. She asked me if she should watch it. Obviously I told her yes, and we set up a few days to watch them all. Just to get an idea of what’s going on in her head, I asked if she knew who Darth Vader was. Her response:
“oh! He is the little green thing! Right?”
“No Aunt _____....no....”
“Shit....”

We got together early on a Monday morning. I gave her three options, Chronologically, Release Order, or Machete Order. She wanted to do the machete order. I asked if she wanted to see every Star Wars movie, or just the ones she needs. She wanted to see them all. And so we began. I showed her Solo, Rogue One, A New Hope, Empire, Phantom, Clones, Sith, Jedi, TFA, TLJ, and TROS. Here is what she had to say about each:

Solo - it was a fun movie, and she can see why people like them. She thought Lando was funny and cool. She liked Han as a person, and she obviously had no idea who Maul was, but he scared her. Qi’ra was just some random lady she didn’t care about. She LOVED Chewie. She thought he was cute and hoped he stuck around for more. Overall, she had a blast watching it. 

Rogue One - This movie blew her away. She loved all the characters, K2 in particular. She was extremely saddened to see all the characters die. When Scarif started, she was mesmerised the entire time. Vader was just icing on the cake. She was screaming “RUN!! GET OUT!!” The entire time. Overall, she loved this movie and was very excited to see the original next.

A New Hope - where to start? She thought Obi-Wan was an amazing role model for Luke, and was sad to see him die. She thought Leia was a badass and loved seeing her on screen. Luke reminded her of my cousin (her son) and that made it very easy to like him. The icing was Han and Chewie. She has always loved Harrison Ford, and seeing him in this, she was captivated. She was terrified Vader would kill everyone again, and was relieved when the Death Star was destroyed. Overall, she thought this was amazing, and regretted not seeing it earlier. 

Empire - this movie hit her hard. When Lando showed up, she was ecstatic, Billy Dee made her very. Very. VERY. happy. Han and Leia had her swooning. Luke grew up a bit, and made her love him even more. Yoda. She thought he was amazing. She became obsessed with him a bit, going so far as to jokingly talk like him a lot. The reveal about who Vader was messed her up. Bad. She started scream “FUCK NO. NOT POSSIBLE. OBI WAN LIED!? HOW COULD HE!! I CANT FUCKING BELIEVE THIS”. When Luke lost his hand and fell, she thought it was the end, seeing him survive made her feel very relieved. I had to explain what Carbonite is, and that made her a little scared for Han. She continued to think Chewie is adorable. Overall, she was obsessed with the series at this point. 

The Phantom Menace - she thought Anakin was some dumb kid, and needed “a swift kick in the ass”. She loved Maul, and Qui-Gon. She was sad to see them go, but liked knowing that Maul survives. It was hard to get through for her. Mainly due to Jar Jar. When I told her that he isn’t in anymore nearly as much, she got very happy. Overall, it was a slog, but she enjoyed aspects. 

Attack of the Clones - She loves Obi-Wan in this movie, and Mace Windu. She thought Dooku was cool, but not really “scary”. She thought Anakin was a whiny brat who needed to get disciplined a bit. The love story didn’t bother her, but she wasn’t a fan either. It was just an aspect of the movie. Overall, another slog, but it was a fun time. 

Revenge of the Sith - this movie blew her away. At this point, she was back in. All the way. Anakin’s fall hit her harder than I thought it would. Obi-Wan and Yoda’s exile left her sad. She missed the Leia comment, and I neglected to point it out. Order 66 made her tear up a lot, and the final duel between Obi and Ani made her cry. She was in love with this movie. Overall, a beautiful experience for her. 

The Force Awakens - seeing the OG characters made her really happy. She loved Finn and BB-8. Han was her favourite. Rey was just another character. Kylo made her think of her other son, who she has had some issues with, so he really affected her. Han’s death, made her cry and scream. A lot. At the end of it, she kept saying “OH MY GOSH. I CANT WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE. SHE ME NOW!!”

The Last Jedi - oh boy....she...hated. This. She almost walked out of it. She couldn’t stand anything that happened. When Luke was on screen, she just yelled “YOURE SUPPOSED TO BE AN OPTIMIST”. When Snoke died she said “that sucked...at least give him a decent death”. She complained about Rey being too good at everything. Her swimming doesn’t make sense etc. My favourite moment was when Rey lifted the rocks at the end and she went “oh. FUCK. YOOOOOU”. At the end of this movie I had to convince her. HARD. to watch TROS. she was furious with the ending and the path the characters took. 

The Rise of Skywalker - she had a fun time. Thought the death fake outs were dumb, and didn’t care about anything else. At the end of it she just said “I don’t know what just happened, and I don’t care.” Palpatine was a cool sight for her, but she thought he was better in every other movie he was in. She said that it would take something big to convince her to watch something else “made by these dummies”. 

She is considering watching my siege of Mandalore and revenge of the Sith Supercut, but decided to wait and let some time pass before she watches more Star Wars.

13,Model Galactic Senate | Star Wars Roleplay Simulation of the Galactic Senate | Looking for New Members,1595794743,"Hey r/StarWars

I have been a fan of Star Wars all my life. Starting from a young age, I grew to love Star Wars not just for its amazing movies, but for the books and lore that followed. Star Wars has an amazing lore, canon, and extended universe that no other movie, show, or book can ever compete with.

I have always loved learning the politics, economy, languages, and personal connections people in Star Wars lore have. How the Galactic  Senate operated, how Palpatine was able to seize control so easily and much more.

With that, I found an amazing community called [r/mGalacticSenate](https://www.reddit.com/r/mGalacticSenate/) where they simulate being the Galactic Senate of the Republic set right before the Clone Wars. In this sim, you can be anything honestly. You can be a report and report the news, be a candidate and run for the  Senate, be a Senator of a region, and possibly be Chancellor.

In order to successfully win a Senator seat, you need mods. You do this by writing bills, writing press releases, making posters, and campaigning.  All of these contribute to the polls during the election cycle which you will need to write events and make posters/press releases to gain in the polls. It really is amazing the fun it actually is. Roleplaying as a  possible Senator in the Galactic Senate and having to campaign to hold onto that.

We have two factions currently:

Centralists  - The Centralists believe in a strong Chancellor while also promoting free trade and free markets. They are also very pro-humanoid focused.  Basically they're the right-wing in Star Wars.

Populists  - The Populists believe in a strong Sebate while also promoting regulated trade and regulated markets. They are also very pro-xenos focused. Basically they're the left-wing in Star Wars

We always encourage more factions with very easy requirements to do so. I  used to run the Imperialist Party. So the options are endless in terms of factions really. Just follow the requirements.

So where will your journey take you? I hope to see you there.

That said, Maul is a finite quantity. We know his end. I really feel that Disney needs to use him in small doses from now on. Ideally they'd only use him in Kenobi with an episode that's essentially a remake of Twin Suns, or something like that. Having him clash with Obi-Wan during the Tattooine years would just kind of cheapen Twin Suns in my view.

And since we have the broad strokes of what he's been doing, and there are only like 10 years between Solo and Twin Suns, I think having him keep on appearing in media over and over again is just overexposure, and kind of ""crams"" him into places. It's how the Marvel inter-movie comics currently seem to show every second of Luke's life between ANH and ESB. Seems like overkill.

Small doses, then shelve him. The only other thing I'd like to see with him is maybe some sort of intermediate force ghost, which shows him kind of at peace with his life.",StarWars,JacobDCRoss,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hydldz/darth_maul_is_approaching_the_end/

31,The Clone Wars Isn't that amazing...,1595790481,"Ok I know, hot take, but before you smash that down vote button hear me out. 

So after season 7 I went back and watched the series again, I think this is my third time watching it and when its good it's really good but I want to talk about some of its problems. 

For example, every time we meet a new unnamed Jedi, we know that's the Jedi thats about to die, just some nameless Jedi who I have zero emotional connection to who dies. I am watching S05E01 just now and again, some random has just died. 

Despite these occasional deaths, lets face it, the good guys basically never lose. I can't really think of a single meaningful loss in TCW. Sure there are times that the Republic is on the ropes or times they're pushed back but its not like we really ever see them lose a major planet and get really pushed by the separatists. 

Speaking of the good guys, its always the same good guys, I get it, we have to have our lead characters but it does kind of feel like Kenobi, Anakin and Ahsoka lead every major conflict of the war. For me this gets a little annoying and very repetitive. It would have been really cool to have explored what the rest of the galaxy was up to other than these 3 characters and their gang of clones. Even when they do explore other characters though it's pretty poor, such as the Jar Jar focused episodes or whatever the hell Pademe was up to. 

The show also feels like a waisted opportunity to explore things a in a little more depth, I love the episodes that explore Sifo Dyas but I always feel like I want more. It could have shown Anakin's fall much better I think.

32,Darth Plagueis' father might be alive during the Clone Wars,1595789325,"So, I am just reading the Book ""Darth Plagueis"" and this happens:

Darth Tenebrous sought out two Force sensitive Muuns to give birth to and raise Hego Damask (later Darth Plagueis). At around the age of 10 after he has been quite a dark child (suprisingly similar to Tom Riddle from Harry Potter), Tenebrous takes Hego and kills his mother.

I thought that was the obvious outcome, until it is said, that Caar Damask (the father) was not killed. Tenebrous and Caar had a deal: In return for impregnating this force-sensitive female Muun, Tenebrous would use his (Sith) influence to get Caar into the Upper Echelon of the Banking Clan's Power structure.

In Star Wars The Clone Wars, the ""Council of five"" is introduced. 3 of them are unnamed. Darth Plagueis' father might have been among them.

The Phantom Menace - She loved it! She was happy when Darth Maul died and sad when Qui Gon died, she hated Jar Jar and was completely oblivious to how this cute child would grow up to be one of the most popular villains in history 

Attack Of The Clones - She thinks it was a bit boring compared to the last one and found the relationship between Anakin and Padme to be weird because Anakin was 5 when she was a teenager. She figured out Palpatine was the Emperor because of his chin. 

Revenge Of The Sith - She said Anakin killing innocent children was a bit too much, and that not even the most evil heartless villains don’t kill children yet this person who we’re supposed to believe still has good in him kills children without any mercy or feeling bad. But she did like the rest of the movie and was really sad when she saw Anakin’s death. 

A New Hope - She was happy to see Luke and sad to see Vader. Surprisingly she didn’t recognize the name Leia and forgot that her and Luke were twins so I decided not to tell her and let her find out herself later. She thought the movie was great though.

The Empire Strikes Back - This is her favorite. She says it’s the best sequel ever and she’s used to sequels being really bad. She was also really mad that Vader would cut off his own sons hand, she thinks that Obi-Wan was wrong for lying about Luke’s dad. I should also mention that she has always hated Chewbacca since A New Hope because she says he won’t shut up. 

Return Of The Jedi - She hates Ewoks and cried when Vader died but was really happy he turned good in the end and even happier to see his force ghost with Obi-Wan and Yoda. 

The Force Awakens - She loved the movie and loved seeing all the characters return again looking really old. She was really sad seeing Han die and shocked because she was really hoping Kylo would be good again, but she was happy Chewbacca shot Kylo and she likes him a bit more now. She said she doesn’t really have an opinion on the new cast because she hasn’t seen enough but was confused as to why the main character was a girl because she’s old fashion and thinks woman can’t be strong :| what can you do? 

The Last Jedi - She’s just really shocked to see how sarcastic and grumpy Luke is now after being the happy and optimistic kid. Not mad just shocked, especially when he threw his old Lightsaber. She was really happy to seek Kylo kill Snoke because she thought he was gonna turn good this time.

Rise Of Skywalker - She told Chewbacca to shut up when he was crying over Leia’s death. She says the whole “planet killing weapon” thing is a bit repetitive and doesn’t like reviving the dead so she didn’t like Palpatine either. I know it might not sound like it because she only named things she didn’t like but she still enjoyed the movie and thought it was funny.",StarWars,-GreggRulzOk-,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hybgza/my_grandmas_opinion_on_every_star_wars_movie/

62,A similar version of the Punworcca 116-class Solar Sailer has been proposed for interstellar travel,1595772732,"**Solar One: A Proposal for The First Crewed Interstellar Spacecraft**

&gt;In this paper it is presented the concept and design of a new type of spacecraft that could be used to make the first manned interstellar travel. Solar one would integrate three near-term technologies, namely: the US Navy CFR fusion reactor, a larger version of NASA Sunjammer light sail, and an array of DE-STAR laser systems. A system of Fresnel lenses and flexible mirrors to propel the sail with sunlight is suggested as an alternative to this array. With a mile-long light sail, Solar One could reach an average of 22% the speed of light, arriving to the closest potentially habitable exoplanet in less than 19 years with the help of a Bussard scoop. Key challenges are reducing the weight of continuous-wave lasers and compact fusion reactors as well as achieving cryo-sleep and artificial gravity.

I think a stalemate between the new republic and imperial remnant/first order would have been an interesting setting, where our heroes are caught in the middle, trying to prevent another galactic scale war, with superweapons on each side. The First order being almost like a USSR/North Korea-esque state.  
The trope of the large imperial menace vs rebellion underdog had already been done in the originals. Why they recycled this, I have no idea. The galactic scale war was done in the prequels, so imo, it'd be fresh to see something different.  


This would only be the backdrop, haven't really thought about specifics, other than the fact that I'd have prefered it if Luke was a part of the trilogy from beginning/mid-episode 7, instead of only first being relevant in episode 8.

I can’t make much of a case for attack of the clones, I see why people didn’t like it, personally I don’t like a lot of the film but everything with jango and the battle on geonosis make the film that much better. And then on to revenge of the sith, do I even need to make a case for revenge of the sith, by far the best of all 11 live action Star Wars films and not only were the fights good, all of order 66 etc but anakins turn to the dark side really compliments and completes the OT, with out the prequels the OT is nothing but a random story with no start but only an end.",StarWars,Ryanmensah,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hy59ti/the_prequel_is_so_overheated/

She's seemingly trying to make sure fans don't forget that she has been with Lucasfilm for a long time, but there doesn't seem to be much love or even nostalgia when she speaks.

Conversely, Filoni gushes love for Star Wars everytime he speaks.  Whether it's talking about intricate story elements or breaking down how truly humbled he was to work alongside George Lucas and all he learned from that experience.  It is so blatantly obvious that he's the man to be at the helm of the Star Wars universe.  Kennedy is a suit, and I would wager she's a pretty darn good one to be where she is in her career.

66,What if... (Spoilers),1595720510,"What if the movies and TV shows had been released in chronological order? TCW released between AoTC and RoTS, TPM released first, OT released after Rogue One and Solo, and at the same time as Rebels, then the ST released along with the Resistance TV show, and all comics and novels released when they would happen in the Star Wars universe. Effects... Chances are, we would see references, cameos, and visits from characters like Ahsoka Tano, Cal Kestis, and Ezra in the OT. The PT would have worse CGI, and OT would have PT level CGI, and ST would have the same level of CGI. Palpatine's plans in the PT would be slightly more of a surprise, same with Anakin's turn to the dark side. We would have seen Ahsoka in RoTS, even if only a cameo, and Rex would be seen more in the OT during ESB and RoTJ, around when he would be a part of the Rebellion, although we did technically see him in RoTJ, if only for a little bit and he had no lines. Luke probably would have met one or more of these Clone War vets and they would have likely given him some advice. Ahsoka would likely have a much greater impact than she did, and her Rebels exit would likely have been changed and she would have been moved into the movies, as she would be one of a few remaining characters that Vader had any emotional connection to during the Clone Wars. Darth Maul might have gotten a cameo in the OT. In other words, a lot of the Star Wars Saga story was affected by the release dates. If they knew about Ahsoka before releasing RoTS, she would have had a much greater impact on the movie. Kenobi might have referenced Ahsoka, probably her leave of the Order, saying something to Yoda like ""I wonder if Ahsoka's leave had anything to do with this."" But he wouldn't be blaming her, he would recognize her effect on Anakin. Rex would also have had a role in RoTS and The OT along with Ahsoka. The Rebels cast would have had an impact on the OT. The ST would likely remain the same, as the only possible effects The OT would have on it would most likely remain the same. Ahsoka would have been too old to fight or do much in the ST, though she could've been a mentor figure to Rey, improving Rey's abilities so that her power and skill levels are explained better, though in TRoS, we hear her voice as one of the force ghosts, so she is likely dead by then. Cal and Ezra (after being found by Sabine and Ahsoka) would have been fairly old, but likely could fight if necessary and could also help to guide Rey. Every clone would be dead by then, so no effect there. Any other thoughts?",StarWars,MikeofK72,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hxwoxa/what_if_spoilers/

9,Will opinions on the Sequel Trilogy soften similar to how they did for the Prequel Trilogy?,1595708988,"Over the years, the once deeply hated Prequels have become generally liked, probably in large part to The Clone Wars series really filling out the characters and narrative surrounding that time period.  

As a younger fan and product of the '90's I was always a fan of the Prequels.  I had a Phantom Menace themed birthday party when I was 6 or so where my aunt and I made a homemade Darth Maul piñata (my mom figured it was okay for my friends and I to beat in someone's head as long as it was the bad guy).  Years later, my dad pulled me out of grade school so we could see Revenge of the Sith in theaters.  And then TCW really supercharged my Star Wars love in jr high and high school.

I always liked the three Prequel movies, but as I got older, I did at least understand that as movies they were inferior to the OT, but I liked them nonetheless.  I always had older SW fans telling me how the Prequels had ""ruined"" Star Wars, which I always felt was a bit of an overreaction.

But now, with the Sequel Trilogy, I have more empathy for how those older fans were feeling back in the early 2000's.  I actually like The Force Awakens despite it being pretty derivative. Last Jedi was total trash in my opinion.  Rise of Skywalker did an alright job of sticking the landing with their hands tied by the previous movie, but I hate that they brought back Palpatine essentially erasing the importance of Return of the Jedi.

In no way has the Sequel Trilogy ""ruined"" Star Wars for me, but I do think they were very poor overall.  Any chance that the general opinion will change over the next decade, similar to what happened with the Prequels?  Will it take Dave Filoni and Disney + to produce series around that time to help fill in the background and make the movies themselves more coherent and meaningful?

P.S. really liked both Rogue One and Solo, and have enjoyed every series (Rebels, Resistance, The Mandalorian) for what it's worth.",StarWars,bjcfutbol,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hxtni6/will_opinions_on_the_sequel_trilogy_soften/

I don't want to be one of those guys who loves an all-canon character who is crazy popular, even if I did before he was cool!

15,"In theory, can a Jedi make a force-bond with their kyber crystal?",1595682722,"I was recently thinking about force-bonding a lot and though: in theory can you make a force-bond with natural kyber crystal since their are ""alive""? 

That would establish the real main difference in CANON between using Synthetic Kyber Crystals VS Natural Kyber Crystals.

Synthetic: if you just purely want a normal lightsaber for a one-time fight instead of using a blaster since you are a Force-sensitive, you can use synthetic kyber crystals. That way you can always decide the colour of the lightsaber, have infinite supply of kyber crystals because you can just make them and don't worry about losing your lightsaber like a blaster since you can always just make another one for a fight.

Natural: if you want a life-long partner who will always be with you in your desperate times of need to lend your power and remain with you until your death then you need to search for natural kyber crystals. Natural kyber crystal will display your true ""soul colour"" through your lightsaber according to your true inner personality. Through deep meditation the Jedi can merge with their natural kyber crystals becoming one therefore creating Force-bond and will feel each others emotions since natural kyber crystals are ""alive"" and have faint ""consciousness"" so they would share your pain with you. Your kyber crystal will grow together with you, if you made a successful force-bond, so the way humans grow and start wearing new clothes you would require to customize your lightsaber to make it stonger. In addition, having a strong force-bond with your natural kyber crystal will grant you the ability ""Lightsaber teleportation"". That means if you lose a lightsaber or someone forcefully takes it away from you, you can always teleport your lightsaber to yourself (how Ben Solo done it in the Rise of Skywalker when fighting against Knights of Ren) because you are best friends with spiritual connection. Even if your lightsaber does get damaged, as long as your kyber crystal is safe the Jedi or any other force-sensitive will always build a new ""better"" lightsaber since you both learn from your mistakes.

That would explain a lot why the Jedi went through such great lengths and hard trials to obtain a real kyber crystal compared to Sith who used chemically synthetic ones just for the sake of having lighsaber. It's about havig a lightsaber/weapon, it's about having a partner you can always trust. Of course, real Sith betray their own natural kyber crystal and torture it to death to turn it real Red! 

By the way, the old Jedi Order prohibited connections and emotions due to their  Jedi Code that's why they never formed deep force-bonds with their kyber crystals. Jedi just ignored them. That's why the Jedi of old could never realise their power. Purely used them for lightsabers. The fact most of the Jedi never upgraded/customized their own lightsaber really repsents how the Jedi Order stagnated. After 1000 years since Ruusan Reformation, the Jedi order never changed therefore stopped exploring new knowledge therefore stopped evolving.

25,Finn should not sided with either side.,1595678821,"I was planning to make a post about how Finn should have Join the FO, jokingly just because of how cool he looked in the FO officer suit , and it would have given him something better to do then what he did in both TLJ and TROS. However in the course of writing it , I noticed something . DJ was right. 

Finn sees how both the first order and the Resistance use their money to support horrible places, then he sees how both of them treat people. He was treated by Rose just like he was treated by Phasma when he was part of the First Order. Remember Rose stunted him and kept belittling him over the course of the movie. 

This get down played a lot but it shouldn't. Finn gets treated horrible by her and it is just glossed over. The same thing happen on FO ship people would not be defending it. 

They clearly don't care about people, he literally was left in what seems to be a store room with out even a medic near by.  He saw how Poe was getting treated before he left. Shut up and follow orders without Question. That is the same stuff the FO does. 

Finn should have side with no one . Also I have heard people say he sides with the Resistance because he learn that  the war was happening everywhere. He already knew this before TLJ. So seeing that aa 3rd party works for both sides isn't that shocking. Heck people even say .. Finn didn't know about war profiteering. But honestly he knew what it was.   Rose didn't have to explain it to him, just told him basically why do you think this place is so fancy.

And after seeing how all the Jedi have Padawans, and how they get trained in the Jedi Temple and on the field, both in the films and in TCW, it hits so much harder to see Yoda as a lone hermit, training what’s believed to be the last of the Jedi, all alone on Dagobah.

I don’t know how controversial this is, but I think that the OT, without the full knowledge of what happened beforehand, wasn’t fully able to capture just how sad, or desperate, or maybe heavy, the situation truly was for Yoda.

I got hit by this, after remembering the ‘Truly wonderful, the mind of a child is’-line in the Prequels, when I saw Yoda training Luke on Dagobah. He truly has been through a lot, the old guy...

Resurgence

The year is 19 BBY. With the Clone Wars sowing death and destruction across the galaxy, damning evidence has been brought to the attention of the Jedi Order, revealing Supreme Chancellor Palpatine to be a Sith Lord. The Jedi make their move. After a monumental struggle, Anakin Skywalker sacrifices himself to ensure the capture of their evil foe. The Jedi are victorious but several powerful Order members lay dead, and dark clouds still loom across the Galaxy. As the Clone Wars rage on, a new threat rises to fill the void left by Darth Sidious, lurking just out of view of the beleaguered Jedi Order. Star Wars: Galaxy is a forum-based play-by-post RPG. We have an active and supportive community. Our members are some of the friendliest around, and we have a helpful staff ready to assist you in your Star Wars journey. We have streamlined the character creation process, making it very easy to jump into the action. Explore an alternate version of the famed Clone Wars, where you can write the destiny of factions, worlds, and forge new legends in the galaxy. We're excited to write with you!

22,I loved the sequel trilogy and here's why. (Despite it having flaws like all movies do).,1595619565,"It makes me sad seeing so many Star Wars fans hate Star Wars. Whenever I'm part of a big fandom it feels like being in a big family but with Star Wars it seems to be a family that's splitting up a lot. I love all 9 films of the saga and I loved it when episode 7 came out with all the hype and the first Star Wars I saw in the theater as I've loved it all my life. With episode 8 and 9 that many fans downright hated particularly 8 it felt like such a letdown. Yes, the trilogy could have been better but I wish people would be more thankful with what they already had. 

The only thing I didn't like about episode 8 was the thing with Snoke but having Palpatine return for felt good for me and I'll explain why below. 

So to sum up basically why I think the sequels are great and would never hate them despite their flaws is because: 

\-Seeing the story and characters that ended over 30 years ago continue with a mix of nostalgia and interesting new content. 

\-Like the other movies they are scored by the legendary John Williams. 

\-Visually they are amazing and that's something nobody can deny. Using realistic puppets for some characters like Babu Frik (there was that issue of too much CGI in the prequels), red as a theme color for episode 8 with Snoke's throne room and Crait's salt and Palpatine's state in episode 9 was so damn haunting.  

\-Han died in episode 7 but came back as a memory to Kylo in episode 9. I loved that like he obviously couldn't have come back as a force ghost not being a Jedi but they still found a way to give his character one last big moment - redeeming his son. Also a twist to see him again.  

\-Luke pulled off the greatest Jedi force trick in front of the First Order army to allow the resistance to escape in his final moments alive. It kind of felt like a throwback to him seeing Obi-Wan let himself die to Vader so he could become a force ghost.

\-While I didn't like Snoke being killed off, it was still an interesting twist as it certainly wasn't expected for him to be killed so suddenly and then Palpatine returning was also a big twist.

\-The part where Rey hears the voices of the past Jedi was my favorite part. Yes it would have been MUCH better if we saw force ghosts helping her defeat Palpatine but I still wish more would appreciate that the scene itself still had Hayden come back as Anakin as a voice along with other Jedi like Obi-Wan and Mace. Some argued Palpatine's return undid Anakin's sacrifice but I'd say his sacrifice was just the beginning. All the Jedi getting together to finally defeat Palpatine for all the shit he made them go through was done in that scene that's why I love it!

\-Canto Bight I enjoyed because it was something else than the war and politics going on in the galaxy kind of like the podracing scene.",StarWars,Atalkingpizzabox,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hx8i8j/i_loved_the_sequel_trilogy_and_heres_why_despite/

24,"Finally finished all the canon novels, and ranked them!",1595618839,"I finally finished all the adult/young adult canon novels(as well as some of the middle-grade ones), and I’ve ranked them from favourite to least favourite with comments on each one. I didn’t rank the middle-grade novels, as I don’t think it’s fair to compare them against more fully fledged books. Let me know if you agree. Or how strongly you disagree.

1. Lost Stars - Setting a love story against the backdrop of the Original Trilogy might not be everyone’s cup of tea, but this was a consistently entertaining read, with great new characters, and cool ways to explore the events that we already know. This is such an easy book to read, and re-read. I still hold out hope for a sequel. Claudia Gray is such a good Star Wars author.

2. Thrawn - Excellent book. It’s great to see someone be underestimated, only to prove their competence time and time again. This book is that. And it’s a joy from start to finish.

3. Alphabet Squadron - I wasn’t overly thrilled about the idea of another turncoat imperial, but I really enjoyed all of the new characters in this book. Yrica was kind of unlikeable, which I enjoyed, as I feel I wasn’t necessarily meant to like the lead character for a change. Flawed individuals somehow coexisting was fun to read about, and the space battles were exciting and quite technical.

4. Master and Apprentice - Another Claudia Gray winner. The journey of being a Jedi is always interesting, and towards the end of the book, there’s some really excellent moments. Qui-Gon is a class act all the way, and his interest in prophecies is exciting in its own right.

5. Dark Disciple - A brilliant way to tell this leftover story from The Clone Wars series. Two excellent central characters on a very questionable mission from the Jedi Council just lends itself so well to an interesting look at morality, and why the Jedi Order lost their way, and eventually fell.

6. Alphabet Squadron: Shadow Fall - Such a depressingly good book. It feels really hopeless for the characters involved, and they really get pushed to their limits. War and death aren’t necessarily fun, and this is one of the few truly bleak stories in the new canon.

7. Thrawn: Alliances - I really enjoyed the dynamic between Thrawn and Anakin/Thrawn and Vader, as well as Thrawn piecing together that connection. I also enjoyed the Padmé sections. Unexpected.

8. Bloodline - Another great Claudia Gray book, which fills in an important period, and addresses Leia coming to terms with the man that her father was. Lots of questions answered.

9. Black Spire - I thought this would be a lame tie-in to the Galaxy’s Edge theme park attraction, but it’s so much better than that. Vi and Cardinal are great characters, and the higher level of violence was a welcome change of pace. The new characters were decent additions too.

10. Lords of the Sith - A really entertaining look at the relationship between Vader and Palpatine. I like examining the dark side, and this book has that in spades.

11. Queen’s Peril - Far better than Queen’s Shadow in my opinion. Written more competently, weaving around the events of The Phantom Menace. More of Palpatine’s pre-saga scheming was described as well, which I always love.

12. Ahsoka - I really enjoyed this one, but I might be biased. I could read a book about Ahsoka’s day out in the countryside, and I’d still love it. Ahsoka is a character I can never get too much of. Not a huge-scope story, but a great post-Clone Wars look at her.

13. Catalyst - Although a decent novel on its own merits, it really enhanced my enjoyment of Rogue One. This one actually feels like an in depth look at one of the most important parts of canon.

14. Thrawn: Treason - Another great Thrawn book with a better look at the Chiss. The detective work was fun as always, and the return of Eli Vanto was a nice plot point.

15. Most Wanted - I loved this book. It’s a small story, but it definitely helped to read it before Solo, to give more context to Han and Q’ira’s relationship. I actually started to wonder if Han would’ve been better off with Q’ira than Leia. I felt dirty.

16. Inferno Squad - A really good read that ties in quite a few elements of the new canon. I didn’t expect much from this one after Twilight Company, which also tied into the Battlefront games, but this was very solid.

17. Dooku: Jedi Lost - I think Dooku is a great character, and this book gives his choices a lot more depth. Learning more about Sifo Dyas was also a highlight.

18. Aftermath: Empire’s End - My favourite of the Aftermath books. Not a fan of the writing style, even after 3 books, but the stakes are high, and I love the glimpses of what the future holds for the remnants of the Empire. Also, Rae Sloane.

19. Phasma - I like exploring new worlds and their customs in these novels, and Phasma does a great job with Parnassos. I like the idea of the story being told as an interrogation. Both Vi and Cardinal are interesting characters. Introduced in a fun way. Phasma was mostly wasted on screen, but this book at least gives her a pretty fun origin story.

20. Leia, Princess of Alderaan - A good look at Leia at an important time in her life. Not my favourite Claudia Gray book, but it sets up who Leia will be in the Original Trilogy.

21. Tarkin - A solid novel, but a bit limited in scope. We have precious little Tarkin screen time in the movies though, so I enjoyed this deeper look, and hope we get more in the future.

22. From a Certain Point of View - While the canon status of this book is debated, it’s definitely a fun read. Not all of the stories stand out, but you’re never more than a few pages from the next one anyway. Leans on nostalgia a lot, but that’s the whole point.

23. Queen’s Shadow - I really wanted to love this book, but in the end, I only liked it. I like the story, and I enjoyed learning more about the role of Padmé’s handmaidens, especially Sabé, who I’d like to see in future media (Kiera Knightley starring in a Disney+ Series? Just hopin’). The problem was that a lot of points seemed to be reiterated on every other page. “She was strong. And capable. And strongly capable. Also, capably strong. They all were. Such strength. Such capability.” It’s like E.K. Johnston thought I couldn’t accept that these people were cool characters, so tried to tell me about it more forcefully than show me. Queen’s Peril was much better for me.

24. A Crash of Fate - Kind of like Lost Stars, but not as good. Still enjoyable, though, with characters I was rooting for, even if the plot does get kickstarted by the biggest coincidence in the entirety of fiction. I’m cool with the two main characters meeting by chance, as that’s the whole reason we have a story. The second major coincidence is a real stretch though. Like, astronomically unlikely.

25. Rebel Rising - I like Jyn Erso a lot, although this is the kind of book that just fills in blanks that your mind could probably do after watching Rogue One. Nonetheless, it’s still a fun read, especially the parts between Jyn and Saw Gerrera.

26. Force Collector - I like the premise, even if the plot does just feel like a tourist trip through the films. It was harmless fun, but didn’t stand out.

27. A New Dawn - I thought this was just ok. I like Kanan, but the plot wasn’t the most exciting. Pretty by-the-numbers, but it introduces Rae Sloane, one of my favourite characters in the books.

28. Aftermath - I can’t stand the writing style in this book, and it’s a chore to read. Having said that, I always enjoy some Rae Sloane, and Sinjir is great in this book, before he becomes less entertaining in the follow ups. I also quite enjoyed the interludes. Really don’t like Snap in this book though. Or Jas Emari for that matter.

29. Heir to the Jedi - This book feels a bit out af place with the rest of the canon. Partly because it’s in 1st person, and partly because of weird concepts like the maths equation species... I didn’t hate it, but I’m in no hurry to ever read it again, especially with so much better content during this time period.

30. Twilight Company - I enjoyed about half of this book, but then it became a bit tiresome, and an effort to finish. Not awful, by any means, and I appreciate the effort to do a full on war novel, but Alexander Freed managed to far surpass this with the Alphabet Squadron books.

31. The Legends of Luke Skywalker - I wasn’t a fan of this. I like the idea behind the book, and the spread of Luke’s story, but I found the writing style a bit awkward, and I’d personally rather have a first hand story about Luke. A good concept though.

32. Canto Bight - Not my thing, really. I like that these stories are told with very little relation to the wider galaxy, but it was a bit too out there for me. Could be bias, as the Canto Bight scenes are some of my least favourite in the films.

33. Resistance Reborn - This book was too limited in scope, and timespan to really create much of a splash, although I appreciated the return of some Battlefront 2 characters. What really stood out about this book, however, was how much author Rebecca Roanhorse seemed to hate the “villain” of the book. I’m not sure if the character of Winshur Bratt was based on someone who killed her dog or something, but it feels like the character was created just so she could bully him with words. Seriously, it just seems like he had a miserable life, no one likes or respects him at any stage, even as a child, and the job and the living he has carved out for himself by the time of this book is seemingly mocked in the way that Roanhorse writes it. I’m not sure if I was supposed to like this character, but I was rooting for him to be happy. It almost felt like torture porn, towards one character. Very strange and mean-spirited.

34. Last Shot - I didn’t particularly like this one. The villain was interesting, but wasn’t in it enough for my liking. Also, I thought the writing was trying to be too witty for its own good. Almost like it was trying too hard to capture Han and Lando’s banter.

35. Aftermath: Life Debt - Even Han showing up couldn’t save this one. More of that terrible writing style from Aftermath, but now wasting an opportunity to tell what could have been an interesting story. I know this book has its fans, but it fell completely flat for me. Sinjir became boring, and I just really don’t like Jas Emari.

I also read the following “middle-grade” novels:

Smuggler’s Run
The Weapon of a Jedi
Moving Target
Before the Awakening
Guardians of the Whills
Cobalt Squadron
Spark of the Resistance
Myths &amp; Fables

They were fast, reasonably entertaining reads, but none of them felt remotely essential. I really enjoyed Myths &amp; Fables though - Plus it canonized the name “Korriban” as a previous name for Moraband. This pleases me greatly.

Were you genuinely satisfied with his role in the trilogy and his treatment from the scripts?,1595598007,"Feels like the biggest wasted opportunity in the whole trilogy.

He just instantly loves Rey and follows her around for the whole trilogy while she barely cares about him back and doesnt need him for anything, it makes him seem so lame. He could have easily been cut from episodes 8 and 9 entirely, I dont understand why they didnt just have him get killed by Kylo's slash in TFA.

In episode 9 he meets a bunch of people who just have the exact same backstory as him, I guess he's not special or unique or impressive after all and shaking off your brainwashing was never a big deal after all. Then they reveal he's force sensitive for no reason? Why not use that or even hint at in the earlier movies?

At the end of TLJ he tries to sacrifice himself to strike at the enemy but he gets shut down by Rose and told that he's wrong for doing that but then he just ends the next movie by trying to sacrifice himself to strike at the enemy again and it's a good thing this time?

23,A new way to watch the films,1595591518,"I have the opportunity to show someone Star Wars for the first time. I am familiar with the most popular watch orders, (release order, chronological order, 4-5-prequels-6...) but I believe I have a new order that I want to try:

1) Episode I
2) Episode II

Starting off with these does 2 things: It cements Anakin as the main character and it leads with two movies that aren’t normally the most well regarded - I like them, but they are pretty consistently rated below the OT.

3) (some of) The Clone Wars

This is controversial, but let me explain why. One of the weaknesses of Episode III is that you don’t really have a sense of the struggle the clone wars had been, how sidious had been manipulating things behind the scenes, and how Anakin was being groomed to be a Sith. All of these are found in The Clone Wars. There may be episodes that have to be skipped and returned to later (especially the last 4) but those are exceptions.

4) Episode IV and V

We skip Episode III for now. We know that the galaxy is radically different now, but we don’t know how and are left to wonder what happened to the Jedi. Since we skipped III, we also don’t have any reason to doubt Obi-Wan that Anakin died and that Luke must take his place. When Vader drops the bombshell in V, we are still shocked. Additionally, because we watched the clone wars we have a better appreciation for characters like Tarkin and Organa, or even Luke’s line about the Clone Wars.

3) Episode III

Now that we have learned the truth about Anakin, we watch his fall to the dark side. This is even more resonant now - we have seen Anakin’s struggle throughout his tenure with the Jedi order. We know what he goes on to do. It fills in the gap in the story that we had filled in a completely different way based on Obi Wans story in IV.

4) Episode VI

We now see Episode VI not as the culmination of Luke’s story but as the culmination of Anakin’s as well - we have seen the parallels between Luke and Anakin and know what is at stake. The movie is a satisfying wrap on the story of Anakin.

5) Sequels

Not much to say here, I really couldn’t justify putting anything here in a different order, so it stays in both release and chronological order.

86,Imagine a Star Wars horror movie,1595566075,"So the closest thing we have to anything horror is the opening segment of kotor 2. You are running around an abanondd mining station alone where everyone is dead and you are trying to find out what happened, then a republic ship docks and you enter and find out it’s ravaged and the crew members are dead. There’s super eerie music playing and you can feel that you are being watched. At this one scene in the ship, you see a man down the hall in the darkness and it was terrifying. Man, imagine what a horror movie would be like in Star Wars either about the sith in general or someone like Vader, not sure. I think that’s what separates kotor 2 from most Star Wars media, there’s this everlasting feeling that the universe is a cold and dead place, where the character feels like they are truly alone and being hunted by shadows.

That’s something I don’t think many people know. Those cinematics are for some people the best representation of Star Wars in their minds. And there’s only like 16 minutes of them. Imagine an entire film!

I think he was one of the founders of Blur studios so he’s really good at working with CGI efficiently and effectively. You can see how great this would be for Star Wars, being the heavy CGI franchise that it is.

He was also the director of the latest Terminator movie: Dark Fate. Which didn’t get received too well. But I think that was more due to the script itself - which Tim Miller didn’t write.

I think the New Republic clearly still exists post-TRoS. They just need to reform their local governments and pick a new NR capital. They probably should rewrite their constitution though (cf.

I have been itching to create my own fan-fiction after the conclusion of the sequel trilogy and have decided to start my character's life in 27 BBY, and incorporate/build on the mysterious Church of the Force.

Because it hasn't been fully developed by either Lucas or Disney, I can't find a good amount of material to help piece the Church and my character's story together.

Have you all come across any other material accounting for the Church of the Force? If so where, and if not, what would you like to see developed from such an idea?

This is just a fun thought experiment and philosophical musing that I'm hoping people will continue to build on in the comments.

The Force is ""the energy that holds everything together.""  Some might say its the ""collective unconscious"" or ""the power of will"" or maybe (and I'd be interested in hearing this idea) some kind of particle or scientifically quantifiable force (gravity, etc.).  I was thinking about the aspect of the Force that allows the skilled to manipulate the actions of weaker minds, and that made me consider that it is just the power of will, or maybe even more specifically, charisma.  In Dungeons and Dragons, you might consider that action as a ""charisma check.""  You're using the sheer force of your personality to dominate another person.

That's ""magic,"" baby.  Like purely attainable, real-world LaVeyan magic.  *Not* like Gandalf magic.  One of the central ideas of LeVayan Satanism/Secular Humanism/Whatever is that ""if one truly believes (like in the Matrix)"" he can assert his will on reality.  He can manipulate reality with his mind.  Which, I mean, that's undeniable, right?  If I'm hungry, I exert *will* to move myself to a place where there's food, I get the food with that will, and I willfully eat that food--its not as glamorous as lightsabre fighting, but according to LaVey, that's magic.  And its kind of beautiful to see the world that way.  

As Alan Moore explains it, our consciousness generates magic by perceiving and manipulating our world, and one of the ways we can manipulate our world is with words.  Its called a magic ""spell"" because its a word (incantation)--you spell it.  If I ask someone to hand me a pencil, and they do, then I've just successfully used a ""spell"" according to Moore (and probably LaVey too).  And one might say, I've just used the Force.

Let's use that same example, but now I don't speak.  I just point to a pencil on a table insinuating that I'd like you to hand it to me (I think I could convincingly do this).  And due to a combination of things forming context like: my gesture, my face, our relationship, all your previous human interactions, etc; you hand me the pencil.  There, with only a gesture, I've moved the pencil across the room to my hand.  I used my own power of will/""charisma"" to manipulate my environment (and that includes you.)

22,Unpopular opinion: Midi-chlorians could've been one of the best things in Star Wars if the fan reaction hadn't been so harsh.,1595534929,"Remember all the way back to the Phantom Menace, when Qui-Gon tells Anakin about Midi-chlorians? Little microorganisms in the blood stream that guide the Force and enable their host to use it?

Well fans hated it and they were never mentioned again (in the movies). People thought that because you could be born with no Midi-Chlorians that not anyone could become a Jedi, and there'd be nothing you could do about it. And that's a fantastic problem to have! 

Imagine you're George Lucas and you're writing the prequels, trying to figure out what the Jedi and Sith are going to act like and structured like. With Midi-chlorians, the Force is now the most powerful resource in the galaxy. 

Maybe the Sith operate like a pharmaceutical company, constantly testing new applications of them. They offer quick shots of Midi-chlorians like drugs, so people can get temporary Force powers but they have no idea how to use them, and it causes a bunch of disasters with users unleashing them. The Sith hunt for Midi-chlorian deposits and with a juiced up workforce. Most of the Sith are synthetic force users, becoming genetically engineered for greater power, but the rule of two still applies to Sith Lords who know all the training and techniques. People are persuaded to join them and the Sith are the de facto rebels to the Republic.

Maybe the Jedi operate like a bunch of vegans, ""naturally"" using the Force, but by their nature heavily discriminatory. So public sentiment towards them is tense, because they don't kill a bunch of people but they prefer dynasties of force-sensitive families and they act like royalty. They could act like a rehabilitation center for Midi-chlorian users.

The Republic has outlawed the commodification of Midi-chlorians, so the Separatists arise because they legalize it, instead of some weird trade conflict. Dooku would be a public Sith Lord and a parallel to Obi-Wan, providing hope to Separatist planets. 

This would put far greater significance on Obi-Wan, who would be treated as a weird outsider within the dynasties in the order and a minor celebrity to the galactic public, because he has a low Midi-clorian count but is still a really powerful Jedi (still keeping the theme of ""anyone can be a Jedi""). His role with Anakin would change to be a different kind of opposite, and their conflict would be focused around Anakin's origin from one of these dynasties and thus overcoming his disconnect with Obi-Wan. 

It fits perfectly in with the original trilogy, because if the Republic became the Empire, they would still outlaw artificial Midi-chlorian use and officially leave it out of their operations, while unofficially use it and look for it like the Sith do. Vader and Sidious, being Sith Lords would still be publicly Sith because of their legal use.

I get really annoyed at fans and youtubers dissing the idea even 20 years later, because it ""dilutes the mystery"" of the Force. Problem is, if you leave the rules vague, it opens up the Force to dilution anyway because there's not clear boundaries. Midi-chlorians only dealt with how people accessed the Force, not the mystery of the Force itself, so you can still have things like The World Between Worlds and the Whills. And this is sci-fi! I love learning the mechanics and politics of a universe, it's why Dune is so interesting.

58,"Could ""The Nameless"" be the Sith Race?",1595527751,"(I flared this as meta because it takes content from a canon book, a canon audiobook, a canon book, and Legends comics books.)

A longer time ago, in a Legend far far away:
Once brothers in the Force, the exiles that survived the HUNDRED-YEAR DARKNESS conquered the planet Korriban and bred with the most-powerful of its Force-sensitive species, the SITH. One of their descendants, NAGA SADOW, returned from within the STYGIAN CALDERA to conquer the galaxy during the GREAT-HYPERSPACE WAR. He was defeated, but the JEDI and the GALACTIC REPUBLIC made a terrible mistake: they attempted to wipe out the entire SITH RACE. The SITH ORDER was concerned with nothing but vengeance from then on... and they attained it during the JEDI PURGE.

The canon novel ""Master &amp; Apprentice"" contains scattered bits of the Chosen One prophecy, including this:
""Only through sacrifice of many Jedi will the Order cleanse the sin done to the nameless.""

The canon audiobook ""Dooku: Jedi Lost,"" says this:
""While my clan-mates huddled together after lessons, swapping tales of the Nameless or whatever phantasmagoria had seized their overactive imaginations, I could be found ensuring my tunic was sharply pressed and boots polished.""

Although the term ""phantasmagoria"" seems to suggest imaginary creatures, it also seems to describe the Red Sith well, skilled at sorcery, alchemy, and engineering tombs that they trap their spirits in, but also rarely seen for centuries. To anyone who did not witness a member of the Sorcerers of Tund or the Lost Tribe of Sith first-hand, they would seem imaginary.

The ""sacrifice of many Jedi"" seems to refer to the Jedi Purge. The ""sin done"" could be the attempted genocide against the Red Sith.",StarWars,JagneStormskull,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hwkp4k/could_the_nameless_be_the_sith_race/

Spare me if you want but I am a big Legends fan and even though Disney shoved it aside in favor of it's current canon, I still love how CIS were portrayed in it's timeline with all my heart!

8,Not gonna happen but a tv show idea,1595515987,"beginning -     
I think having a clone wars band of brothers type show would be amazing no sugar coating no making it ""simple"" for the normies who don't understand the lore just large scale battles from the EU or even new battles. It would follow one squad from a battalion or a larger battle group, and just show their stories and the hardships that clones went through.    


the sugar coating section -   

When I say ""No sugar coating"" I mean don't let the republic win every battle because that's just not true they didn't win every battle they lost a good few battles in the war. If you don't know what band of brothers is its a mini-series about Easy company, 506th regiment and it just tells their story. Ratings, as you may have been able to tell when I put ""no sugar coating"" if this show was to be made Disney would have to eat their pride and rate it pg - 13 or MA depending on which battles were shown for example if they had an episode where they went to the battle of mimban it would most likely be MA im not going to explain the battle of mimban to anyone who doesn't get it.     


art style -   
Art Style, the art style would be similar to the old republic trailers, you guys know what im talking about if you have seen them if you haven't then look it up on youtube the things are gritty and glorious. live-action would be amazing but the budget would have to be giant to get all the actors so CGI is 100% the way 

&amp;#x200B;

story -   
The story as I said would be based on band of brothers type story but not exactly some episodes wouldn't be super exciting with explosions and blaster fire everywhere, some would just be them at an outpost watching for droids or maybe them in a trench talking going more into the characters, or there at - te breaks down and that episode is them working on it and guarding the area, So what im saying is if its pg - 13 or MA it's gonna have adults and older teens watching it most likely it doesn't have to entertain little kids who just want to see explosions and death there would still be plenty of that but not all the time.

A great game that I think would be \*very\* popular would be an open world Star Wars game. Similar to the Dark Souls games and the popular Ghost of Tsushima game, this would have a massive collection of a dozen or so major planets with a couple moons in between. You could choose from twenty or so races from an Utapaun to a droid. You could choose a gender, and finally whether or not you were force-sensitive.

As you progressed, you would level up and become stronger or more mechanically minded and unlock new race / occupation based abilities. You could settle down or become a bounty hunter.

This kind of thing could expand to allow selective or worldwide multiplayer gameplay, though that would make the game vastly more complicated.

This kind of thing would take a long time to make, but I think it would be amazing if produced. I think it could be called Star Wars Galaxy or something like that, if it isn't already a thing.

29,Obi Wans life was really sad,1595508466,"To preface, Kenobi is my favorite Star Wars character and rewatching shows such as TCW and the prequel movies I realized just how sad Kenobi’s life was.

Kenobi’s childhood was nothing different from most Jedis, except for the fact that he was brought to the Jedi temple at a pretty old age (3 years old while most forced sensitive children are brought at 6 months) which may have possibly had some effects on him. 

As Padawan to Qui-Gon Jinn while in Mandalore, Kenobi fell in love with Duchess Satine Kryze but ended up continuing his training and tried to push past his feeling for Duchess Satine, a decision in which Kenobi would always regret. Also as Padawan, during a duel on Naboo with the Sith Darth Maul, Kenobi held his former master, Qui-Gon, in his arms as he died and would forever hear his masters voice speaking to him.

After being promoted to Jedi Knight, Kenobi had to train Anakin and at one point had to keep Anakin from leaving the Jedi order which must have felt disappointing as his master. Also Kenobi struggled with keeping Anakin in line.

During the clone wars Kenobi was injured countless times but was also abandoned. This was when Anakin finally was no longer Kenobi’s padawan, Ahsoka had left the Jedi order and when order 66 was executed, had to watch the love of his life die in his arms, and Kenobi was betrayed by not only his entire battalion but one of his closest friends, Commander Cody. 

Also it was during this time that Darth Maul seemingly rose from dead and tormented Kenobi. Maul loomed over Kenobi as it meant Kenobi never truly took revenge for Qui-Gon.

In Episode III, Kenobi had to duel his best friend who was trying to kill him, when all Kenobi wanted was his brother back, and he was forced to incapacitate Anakin, and wasn’t even able to finish him off.

Then Kenobi, as one of the few remaining Jedi took the job of watching over young Luke Skywalker on the barren planet of Tatooine. He lived as an outcast just watching over this young boy grow and had to completely change his identity. Kenobi suffered from boredom and even insanity at some points due to his hermit lifestyle out in the desert, and Lars had even barred him from seeing Luke sometimes, the one purpose Kenobi had.

Kenobi living out in Tatooine had some close calls with some beats trying to protect Luke and even ends up fighting Maul again, but I suppose that once Luke found R2, Kenobi’s life did get slightly better (for the short period he was around).

Kenobi’s whole life seems to just be filled with pain and to me is one of the saddest stories through all of Star Wars.

59,Just MY opinion on the current state of the Star Wars Fandom.,1595495265,"I think Star Wars (the movies/shows/merchandise) right now is possibly doing better than ever (SW The Black Series/Hot Toys/The Vintage Collection/Mandalorian/CW/Rogue One/Solo/TLJ). However, the fans are the same. Unfortunately it's become fairly clear that a certain portion of fans, however small they may be, are extremely toxic. The Sequel Trilogy is not meant ONLY for fans of the Original Trilogy. But some fans act like it. Almost as if they're entitled to them. But they aren't. The new trilogy is meant for the next generation just as the Prequel Trilogy was meant for the previous (my) generation. My generation has completely embraced the Prequels. However bad YOU may see them, it was OUR Star Wars. I think you can agree that nostalgia is the sole factor in our love for Star Wars. We remember collecting the toys, watching the movies, memorizing the lines, playing the games. It's easy to walk into the theater with certain ideas and expectations for a movie. Especially after watching the trailer for the 100th time. But you just can't decide you don't like a movie because what YOU envisioned didn't come to pass. You didn't make the movie. You're a fan. Just like everyone else. That doesn't mean you can't criticize it. Go ahead. But some of you take it too far when you attack actors and filmmakers and producers who are just doing their job. Kathleen Kennedy. George Lucas. Rian Johnson. JJ Abrams. Jake Lloyd. Ahmed Best. Natalie Portman. Hayden Christensen. Daisy Ridley. Laura Dern. Kelly Marie Tran. Please. Just enjoy the movies, or don't watch them. I honestly have no clue how some of you find the time to hate these people and movies.

63,Imagine if you will a retelling of the Skywalker saga in medieval times: The Phantom Menace.,1595491133,"Based on Dan Bradford's drawings the retelling of a world twisted by magic known as the force as paladins of an ancient order carry on across provinces and oceans instead of galaxies.

Space ships turn into Boats

Speeders into Horses and carts

Blasters into crossbows and muskets.

Imagine if you will Phantom Menace

2 brave knights journey via ship to stop the trade Clans blackade of Naboo a lush province and swamp with wild natives and grand cities, there their boat is destroyed in an ambush as the are docked on the trade Clan's mighty floating war fortress. They battle through mechanical golems and eventually hide themselves on a raiding boat headed for the swamp lands where they meet the Gungans which don't change too much for their original idea but just with less fancy tech (Shells for shields and such). They head to the royal city via an underground tunnel system with the aid of a tamed beast, rescue the queen during the invasion and leave on a fast royal sailboat to the neighboring desert province run by powerful mercenary barons to make repairs that the ship sustained during the escape including a rare sail needed for the journey. They hide in a secret desert cove.

They meet a young stable boy named Anakin who is a slave and come to find out he has great magical ability and that he is apart of an ancient prophecy, with the Knights help they sign him up for a chariot racing event and after winning get the repairs and the vital sail they need to get home and take the boy to the council to be admitted into the order but before they depart from their secret cove a hooded knight in black attacks them with what looks to be nunchucks. They venture to the grand city province of Coruscant and Naboo's queen and her senator Sheev look to get aid to break the blockade around the province of Naboo while Jinn and Kenobi take Anakin before the council. When that doesn't work and the council rejects the boy Knight Jinn steps up to teach him as Squire Kenobi takes the trails to become a knight of the order. The crew set out to free Naboo with the help of the swamp dwelling Gungans and they go to war with the trade Clan. Knights Jinn and Kenobi face off against the Death-Knight Maul welding a battlestaff/nunchucks hybrid in the Coves underneath the city slowing growing closer to the pit that leads into the Underdark of Naboo and Knight Jinn is impaled by one of the spike on the battlestaff after an intense fight.

Meanwhile Anakin aids the attack skooners as they desperately try to take out the core of the Trade Clan's war Fortress to stop the endless amount of golems the Gungans are fightings. He does this by accident and despite sort of just winging it he's a natural with the boat and ultimately destroys the core powering the golems and destroying the war Fortress. Knight Kenobi after almost getting knocked into the pit leading to the underdark of Naboo by Maul gains the upperhand and slices Mail in 2 where Maul now in half falls into the pit into the underdark. He holds his master one last time as his final request is to train the boy as his Squire. They have a funeral for Jinn and Celebrate the defeat of the Trade Clan with a huge parade.

This is of course a rough idea but let's face it you know the story it's just the tech that changes.",StarWars,garmdian,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hwbq4q/imagine_if_you_will_a_retelling_of_the_skywalker/

2,A question for lore experts: Do any of the new races or planets in the Sequel Trilogy have precedent in canon materials?,1595473653,"One of the things I really liked about the Clone Wars show was how it added more color and backstory to a lot of the characters, species, and planets we only see briefly in the first six movies.

The Sequel Trilogy introduces a bunch of, to me, seemingly new races (the nuns on Luke's island, the folks with the short trunks on the festival planet where they find Lando, whatever species Maz and Unkar Plutt are, etc.) and planets (Kijimi, Exegol, Jakku, whatever that casino planet is called, Salt Hoth, etc.).

Is this all completely new stuff, or is some of it partly based on / does some of it has precedent in pre-existing canon stories?

If the latter, is there any canon explanation for why we haven't seen any of it before? Individual planets being newly visited is not surprising - it's a big galaxy. But it's odd to think there would be multiple entire races of spacefaring civilizations that we never see even one member of, even as a background extra, in any story set on Coruscant. Is it possible the seemingly new planets were part of the Separatist Confederacy, and that's why we never got a chance to see them before?",StarWars,chainsawinsect,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hw843l/a_question_for_lore_experts_do_any_of_the_new/

Then the seen with Jabba came and it really got me disappointed. I just finished 6 today and the fake creature singing the song at Jabbas palace wanted me to throw a brick at my TV.

97,I love this franchise but not the sequel trilogy,1595452091,"I’ve been thinking about this for a few months because I really want to enjoy the sequels. Visually, the films are stunning, both the pacing and the quality of production should be enough to draw anyone in, particularly longterm fans. Not only that, the dialogue is far better then the PT and OT.

Yet, Episodes I - VI hold a place close to my heart (even Attack of the Clones). This got me wondering.

For me it boils down to the universe. The earlier films build the world, and add these little hooks all over the place that makes the place feel expansive and lively. Like the story we are watching is only one of a million interesting things going on at any one time. What is Toche Station, who is Bobba Fett, why does Han have a bounty on his head. Small lines such as ‘dissolved the imperial Senate’ offer the viewer glimpses of the Galaxy, expanding our minds and causing our imaginations to run wild as we watch the story unfold.

It is possible that I’m less imaginative now than when I watched the other films for the first time. However, I just can’t think of many instances where the ST shows the viewer that there is more to the Galaxy than just the story we are watching, it feels small and dead - like there is nothing else important going on. The films even avoid adding to the universe, rebranding the old rivalry and tweaking X-Wings to look a bit newer. At times arcs are reused that have already been played out.

As films the ST are good, but Star Wars films always had more to offer. Pod Racing, shooting wamp rats in your T-16, Wedge, Biggs, Captain Panaka, Jabba, the relationship between Obi Wan and Cody etc. were all largely irrelevant details that suggest more is going on than is shown on screen and those possibilities really drew me in to the universe.",StarWars,Farder-Coram,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hw27ra/i_love_this_franchise_but_not_the_sequel_trilogy/

This Spin-Off takes place during the post-republic era. Which means it happens AFTER the events of Order 66. Here's a nice theory for the plot. The Bad Batch didn't have chips implanted in their brains because they were rejected by the Kaminoans because of their ""disabilities"" or rather, SPECIAL abilities. Therefore, they would disobey Order 66. But their latest team member, Echo didn't have any special abilities and he was an ordinary clone trooper. Therefore, he WILL obey Order 66. This could possibly end with them having no choice BUT to kill Echo. I know it's extremely sad to watch his death for the SECOND time. But, it will bring many great story arcs for the Spin-Off.

To me it just seems as if its just because it's a good end to their childhood and the massive hype for it recently that people think this. 

Personally, I could name numerous arcs better than this by far. It certainly has its weak moments.

I have a headcanon that after the destruction of the first Death Star, while the rebels were on the run from the Empire, Rex began to research what happened to some of his fellow clones after Order 66. Many remained in service, while others died. Finally, he learns what happened to Echo. (I know that we don’t know what happens to Echo after he joins the Bad Batch, but my headcanon is that he died in service.) 

With this, Rex would obviously be distraught when he learns that his brother is dead. In his honor, when they established their new base on Hoth, Rex asked the rebel leaders if they could name it in his honor. Thus, they dubbed their base “Echo Base”.

83,Serious Post: Star Wars has a colonialism problem,1595432953,"I'm going to get downvoted for this but I have to write it out, as it's started bothering me. To be clear I love Star Wars and I'm not calling for us to 'cancel' it or anything, but I think we need to talk about a major problem in pretty much all of Star Wars media, which is that it constantly looks down on ""natives"" or ""primitive"" peoples that the main characters, antagonists, and others encounter whenever they are on a planet.

I just finished watching the new season of Clone Wars and it dawned on me that many of the episodes, and also in the movies too, take place on a planet that has a native or indigenous non-human population and less technically advanced, who are looked down upon and trampled on by the colonizing republic, imperial, or rebel forces.

In season 7 of Clone Wars, I realized this when watching the first arc (with the ""Bad Batch""). In this instance, Anakin and the clones come to the Techno Union planet where there is also a village of ""primitives."" It seems that these people were on the planet before the Techno Union showed up, and they are just disregarded. Ultimately they are shown to be fierce warriors, which is good I suppose, but it generally demonstrates the main powers' disregard for non-advanced peoples. The Techno Union just colonized this planet and took it away from its native population.

The same thing can be said about the Gungans in TPM. Do we really think that the Naboo are native to the planet? They are just human people, the Gungans are adapted to the specific terrain and environment and they are not space-faring (at least within TPM itself). The Naboo are clearly colonizers, they also look down on the natives which is a big plot point in the movie itself.

And don't even get me started on the ewoks! Again and again Star Wars media depicts and represents ""simple"" peoples who don't have the capabilities of the Jedi, the republic, the empire, etc. and end up caught in the crossfire. I know star wars is fictional and we shouldn't take it too seriously but it does seem to me that it represents something very dark and NOT ok, given how we have dealt with a very serious history of colonialism within the actual human experience.

I also will get flak for saying this but Star Trek does this better. Does the Republic not have any respect for native non-technological populations? The idea of the prime directive seems much more civilized, the idea that you should not interfere with a population or people who is not as advanced as you.",StarWars,IReallyLoveAvocados,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hvw5sp/serious_post_star_wars_has_a_colonialism_problem/

I vaguely remember either a line from Episode I where Qui-Gon says that they aren't a private army and can't fight a war.

It could have been a line from Episode II where the Jedi Council is discussing the clone army. I've been searching for the better part of an hour now, but can't seem to find it.

I skimmed the script of Episode I, and the closest line I can find is the following:

    SABE and EIRTAE stand behind QUEEN AMIDALA as she talks with QUI-GON and CAPTAIN PANAKA. OBI-WAN and JAR JAR watch.
    
    CAPT. PANAKA: As soon as we land the Federation will arrest you, and force you to sign the treaty.
    
    QUI-GON: I agree... I'm not sure what you wish to accomplish by this.
    
    AMIDALA: I will take back what's ours.
    
    CAPT. PANAKA: There are too few of us, Your Highness.... we have no army.
    
    QUI-GON: And I can only protect you. I cannot fight a war for you.

85,Darth sidious and yoda are flawed characters,1595432868,"First of all let me just point out that this is just a thought from all the information that i currently know as i have only recently step foot into the star wars universe just before quarantine (quickly becoming obssessed over it.) If i am lacking any information or you completly disagree then let me know why. As am always looking to learn more about this universe.

Yoda- one of if not the most powerful jedi masters to have existed and before the skywalkers, had the most midiclorians known to the jedi's. Also has the life span x10 of that of humans. When cosidering those factors shouldn't he be on par with anakins skywalkers potential powers by the end of his life span. As we know that the more midiclorians you have the quicker you can advance with the force. Sort of like downloading an image using dial up connection (low midiclorians) and fiber optics ( high midiclorians). The fiber optics would obviously finish downloading years before dial up. So the fact that yoda had 900 years to study and grow power in the force shouldn't he be able to do everything the chosen one would potentially be able to do. If you say that well he didn't crave power then i say that he obviously was studying and meditating so he would end up knowing about the abilities by the end of his life span. 

Darth sidious- arguably the most powerful sith lord to have existed and had all the knowledge of the dark side of the force due to the telos holocron. One of his abilities was force foresight allowing him to look into the future and see if his plans would come to fruition which he constantly did. Because of this abilitiy he was able to be prepared for anything against his plans with includes vader yeeting him into the hole thingy from which he transfered his essence into another body. So if he is able counter and plan for every attack and attempt on his life he shouldn't be able to be killed by the jedi's or anything other than him dying of his own free will. So the fact that Rey palpatine (not skywalker definitely not skywalker) was able to kill him because with the help of the jedi's is just completely wrong and impossible. If he was not able to see that rey had the help of the previous jedi's then he should of see rey reflecting the lightning back at him to which he should of prepared for.

98,"The Star Wars Prequels are, un-ironically, fantastic and all-time great films.",1595430524,"
The trilogy is one of the best examples of how a narrative can spread like a wildfire with modern communication. And an example of people blindly buying into that narrative. 

The common criticisms (I.e. too much politics, jar-jar, etc.) are not really criticisms at all... they are just stating things that were not what people expected to see in the first Star Wars movie in two decades. Look at some of the things that you rarely, if ever, see get brought up when talking about the quality of the prequels “at surface level”...

———-

The Phantom Menace is the movie that gets the most heat but for me it’s the best of the 3: 

-We are introduced to two amazing new planets that inspired the same awe as the original trilogy did with its imagination and world building. 

-The entire character of Qui-Gon Jin. A Jedi that is striving for reform in his own order that he has committed his entire LIFE to, even at the expense of being “punished” out of leadership positions he fully deserves. A Jedi that can already see the cracks in the shield that lead to the events of the next two films. A Jedi that molded Obi-Wan and this Anakin into the people and Jedi they became. Amazing. 

-An amazing battle between the two Jedi and the first Sith to reveal itself in thousands of years. It is a battle for Anakin’s father figure, mentorship, and destiny. Basically, a battle for the chosen one’s soul. All with a legendary score and the best choreography of the entire saga no less. 

Overall: So much happens in this movie that provides justification for the development of Anakin, Padme, and Obi-Wan’s characters. It sets a brilliant stage of galaxy-wide politics that subtly paints the world of Star Wars to be less black-and-white than we had ever seen before. Yet all people want to talk about is spinning being a cool trick. 

———

Attack of the Clones is admittedly my least favorite of the trilogy but it still brings everything to the table that it needed to:

-This film is all about Padme and Anakin. I know people get sore over how the romance was and led and I know this counter argument is made all the time, but I’m going to make it anyways. Anakin had lived in an order that had basically devolved into a religious cult with extreme political influence since he was a small boy. His only parental figure had been killed by Darth Maul, he was constantly under the stress of being the *chosen one*, and he had not seen Padme, probably the largest source of personal hope and happiness that he had experienced in his life, in years. The romantic dialogue should not be straight out of James Bond. Anakin is an arrogant, extremely smart person that has lived a pretty fucked up life. I think that the Anakin-Padme arc in this movie did a good job conveying a realistic relationship between two people with vastly different places in society. 

-The escalation of violence in the universe was shown in a great way. A clone army all for the republic that was made without the all-knowing Jedi’s knowledge? Sounds sketchy right? But what better was to show off how broken and overconfident the order is than by them just steering into it lol? 

-Count Dooku is a perfect character to introduce. Now the line is completely clear: Dooku has the clarity to see the problems the Jedi cause and is so extreme that he forms the entire separatist alliance and becomes the Sith apprentice——&gt;His apprentice has the clarity to see that Dooku is right but peaceful, realistic steps need to be taken to make amends——&gt;Obi-Wan sees where Qui-Gon’s perceived radicalism got him (disrespected by the Jedi and ultimately killed) and is much more of a loyalist as a result——&gt;Anakin, feeling alone and used, feels that his own master is more aligned with the religion that basically re-enslaved him than he is with himself. Dooku was a perfect choice for a villain in order to tie the story back to itself and introduce the political power the Sith world as well as the physical power. 

Overall: Attack of the Clones clearly has some illogical moments that are done out of fan-service or to get a “ta-da!” moment. It also had some wasted potential. But the spine of the story is still there and I think Lucas achieved what he wanted to with it. 

——-

Revenge of the Sith is a movie that most people comment on as being “dark”. Not necessarily as a criticism but regardless to that I say “duh”. We as an audience already know that the galaxy was about to devolve into a war ridden dictatorship. The impressive part of RotS is that it achieved that vision with emotion and, frankly, badassery... 

-The opening scene is perfection. Anakins true power and growth are revealed via defeating Dooku as is Palpatine’s influence on him. Plus the whole act is just an awesome depiction of how great action scenes can be in Star Wars. 

-We got to see Palpatine tugging on the strings (to perfection) to plant the final seeds of Anakin’s complete mental breakdown. Assigning him to the council doubles as a challenge to the Jedi’s pride as well as a political power move. The much-memed story of Darth Plagueis the Wise is actually a brilliant scene that teases to Anakin everything he has been longing for his entire life. 

-The scene with zero dialogue showing Anakin and Padme in tears looking across at each other’s locations. Padme fears for Anakin rationally and Anakin fears for Padme irrationally and it is at that moment that his logic and perspective changes to exactly what Palpatine wanted it to be. 

-The duel on Mustafar... I mean, enough said. Emotionally charged, brilliant setting, crushing ending. Crazyiness. 

———- 

I think that the narrative that I spoke about before is what, unfortunately, set the tone for the mass audience for the entire trilogy. People did not want to take it seriously so they didn’t. As a result, everyone, professional critics included, chose not to give credit for so many amazing things these movies brought to the table. Now that the “dust has settled” 15 years later people seem to finally be coming around. This is a whole different can of worms but I think witnessing what a truly awful trilogy looks like from Disney has opened some eyes as well. 

I’m not saying that the prequel trilogy is perfect by any stretch of the imagination. And it certainly did not do itself any favors at times. But the brilliance and creativity of the storytelling far far far outweighs its flaws.

Everyone knows this to be Anakin Skywalker, but I'm here to pose a question... what if the Chosen One is passed down from generation to generation? What if there are multiple ""Chosen Ones?"" In the Twin Sun's episode of Star Wars Rebels it was revealed the Obi-Wan believes Luke is the Chosen One, and as Sam Witwer says, he thinks this because Anakin failed him and he doesn't think he is the Chosen One because of that. But maybe Obi-Wan had a point. While yes, Anakin killed the Emperor (or so we thought), Luke helped turn Darth Vader and result in the death of the Emperor, so does Luke also hold the title of ""The Chosen One?"" As for Rey, she also restored balance to The Force by killing Palpatine in Rise of Skywalker, and Anakin even tells her to bring balance to The Force like he did. Is Rey the next descendant of the Chosen One lineage if it was foretold by Anakin that she would bring balance to The Force?

A tier: Yoda, ROTS Anaki, Ashoka, Grevious, Luke
B tier: Kit Fisto, Qui-Gon Jin, Ventress

55,A couple positives from someone who isn't a big fan of The Last Jedi,1595373892,"Hey guys, so. I have some pretty heavy disagreements about the direction of the story, particularly with Rey and Luke's individual parts, and side character work also. A handful of canonical inconsistencies that annoy me as well.

But to the The Last Jedi crowd, I just wanted to say I thought Kylo Ren was handled very well, from Adam's performance, to his tangible development throughout the film. Snoke as a character aside, all the Kylo stuff was golden.

I also thought Leia was handled very well. She was the badass that I read in Star Wars Bloodline, manifested on screen. 

To point out my favorite scene, I have two that are tied. One being angry Kylo storming out of the throne room and just wrecking shop with his TIE Silencer, completely validating his family relationship to Han and Anakin, probably the two best pilots in Star Wars, and the hesitation scene with Leia on the bridge showing Ben Solo was not completely lost.

And while I am not a fan of the direction Rian went with Luke, I thought the cliff scene was wonderful.

I thought Luke perfectly articulated a good middle ground between how the Jedi used to percieve the force, and how narrow thinking is bad. I.E. Lifting rocks, and how if the Jedi dies the light dies is vanity, don't you see that.

That really reaffirms how even the Jedi while mostly pure intentioned, really know little about the force. I harken back to when Obi Wan meets the Son of Mortis and calls him a sith, and he laughs and says yes, and no. 

How when Kanan meets the Bendu and says You're a force wielder... But you're not a jedi.

Ahsoka saying just when you think you  understand the force, you don't. 

The force doesn't belong to the jedi, although I think it as an all encompassing entity recognizes their significance to the universe and its balance.

Oh and TLJ looks stunning and John Williams kicks ass. My least favorite of the saga, but has redeeming qualities for sure. Just thought I'd inject some positivity as you probably don't hear much from people that hold my general opinion on that movie.",StarWars,RipCity501st,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hvied3/a_couple_positives_from_someone_who_isnt_a_big/

I can't really see them enjoying Episode 4-6 because these look old (I am *not* saying that they look bad, but kids usually prefer high quality stuff nowadays). But Episode 1 is such a bad starting point too altough the plot is easier to follow if one starts with Episode 1, namely one gets the introudction of Vader in Episode 3 and one gets Rogue One to explain the Death Star fault.

6,I really think Ahsoka is in Rogue One,1595362754,"When Rogue One first came out, I seriously thought I saw Ahsoka for a brief moment on Jedha, right before Cassian and Jyn reconnect after a very brief separation. I searched high and low in the following weeks through all the ""Easter Egg"" videos but no one ever mentioned it. I figured if NO ONE else is seeing what I'm seeing then it probably is just me reading into a split second shot that. However after a rewatch recently, and after seeing Ahsoka echoing the ""I am one with the Force, and the Force is with me"" mantra in Clone Wars 7, and reexamination of Rebels, I am actually more convinced that Ahsoka is in fact on Jedha in Rogue One. We already know she is a  Fulcrum agent at this time,  - I believe Cassian definitely knew about ""fulcrum"" given his role in the rebellion. I also believe that it makes sense that Ahsoka would at some point travel to Jedha to learn about the Force outside of the Jedi. I do not believe Cassian would have entrusted Jyn with any Fulcrum info at this point since she isn't fully trusted yet and is only getting info pertinent to her father and Saw's Rebels. Speculatively, it also makes sense that Ahsoka would be interested in the planet and Guardians of the Whils.She may have even interacted with Them/Chirut at some point and taught them this mantra?

&amp;#x200B;

[There are several background characters wearing this type of hood, including an older Human woman, but she appears behind Jyn later, and is shorter. ](https://preview.redd.it/2s2r3d8gq9c51.png?width=1208&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78a77f5503f5569df409ea8f0bb31d7caa396fd5)

&amp;#x200B;

 The lines immediately proceeding the appearance is only audible with Subtitles and is Chirut (prior to his on screen introduction) saying ""May The Force be with You"" Cassian Says 'Wait for Me"" and Chirut again saying ""May the Force of Others be with You.""and takes place only feet away from Chirut. Cassian excuses himself very briefly and walks over to the hooded figure, who appears to have a bearded body guard or companion. The scene then cuts to Jyn meeting Chirut. Cassian comes back and then they continue. Cassian and Jyn meet the pilot informant later - so then who was he talking to? Ahsoka also had, arguably, the closest relationship with Saw of any Jedi so it's another clue that this really could be her. Anyway, I digress. There is a brief shot of a hooded figure - while it seems random, I think it was intentional. The hooded figure appears to be Tagrutan or at least of a species with a raised head - but I think it looks a lot more like a Tagrutan than Twilek. When Rogue One came out, we hadn't yet seen a hooded Ahsoka, but we do see this at the end of Rebels, and TCW season 7...

With all the Rumors of a live action Ahsoka show, as well as the intended Cassian show, maybe this is a Deep Easter egg. Or I could be totally wrong and it's nothing. But Cassian has an off screen conversation either way with a character that is very close to the Guardians of the Whils with dialogue that is kind of a clue in. The scenario makes sense to me too.",StarWars,Avedisdrummer09,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hvez5f/i_really_think_ahsoka_is_in_rogue_one/

Now that we know ""slaying Snoke"" was Kylo's final test in becoming worthy of the Sith, it has me wondering what would have happened if Kylo had actually turned his own lightsaber to kill Rey instead of Snoke in that crucial moment.

Here's my alternate version of the scene:

\--------------------

Snoke: I see his mind: I see his every intent. Yes. I see him turning the lightsaber to strike true!

Ren turns his own lightsaber towards Rey.

Snoke: And now, foolish child, he ignites it... and kills his true enemy!

Ren ignites his lightsaber cutting through Rey's abdomen and she collapses to the ground.

Snoke: Yes my apprentice, your ruthlessness is to be commended.

Ren stands over Rey, frozen in time, digesting what has just occurred.

Rey: Ben... why?

Rey's eyes roll to the back of her head, her life gone.

Snoke: Love... love was her final thought. What a fool. She actually loved you and would do anything for you... To kill someone who loves you is to truly let go. Maybe you are worthy of Vader's mantle afterall... maybe.

Ren's hand begins to shake, gripping his lightsaber. A tear runs down his cheek. He's about to explode.

Ren: Maybe?

Ren stares at Snoke with the utmost hate, his eyes turning yellow.

Ren: Maybe?!

Ren SNAPS and throws his lightsaber, spinning like a boomerang as it cuts through every single one of Snoke's Praetorian Guards. It comes back to his hand.

Snoke is crouched down, having just dodged the blade. His Guards disposed of around him. He stands up, shaken by Ren's power, but tries to remain calm.

Snoke: Yes. That is the Kylo Ren I always knew you were. Such power.

Ren walks towards Snoke like a predator honing in on it's prey.

Ren: You want to see power, Snoke?

Snoke aims his right hand out.

Snoke: Don't be reckless now...

Force lightning shoots out from Snoke's finger tips and ricochets off the Throne Room floor towards Ren.

As he's walking, Ren absorbs the blast into his hand with ease and sends it back back at Snoke which strikes Snoke's arm, crippling him.

Ren comes to a stop, standing in front of Snoke who is grasping his wound.

Snoke: My apprentice, you've proven your worth, you don't have to-

Ren: Enough.

Lightning shoots out from both of Ren's hands, melting Snoke's already shriveled skin from his weak frame.

Ren stands over Snoke's fuming corpse.

Ren: Vader could only dream of such power.

\--------------------

What is the purpose of this fan-fic exersize? I believe that either way, Snoke would've died by the hand of Kylo Ren in two ways:

\-Kylo kills Snoke with the Skywalker saber to save Rey and use her to dispose of the Guards.

or

\-Kylo kills Rey and is filled with so much rage, having now disposed of his father and now another person he was growing to love - would snap and that mighty Skywalker blood would fuel his overflowing anger and he would slaughter Snoke and his guards in a darkside rage.

In both scenarios, Kylo kills his master making him worthy of the Sith and Palpatine would announce his presence to the Galaxy.",StarWars,skywalkinondeezhatrz,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hvekhg/if_kylo_killed_rey_in_the_throne_room_snoke_would/

1. In honor of the day I wore a t-shirt that's printed to look like a knitted sweater with Chewie's face and ""Happy Life Day"" on it. I was in line to get my photo taken in front of the Falcon when Chewie himself walked by. I got his attention, pointed at my shirt, and said, ""Happy Life Day, big guy!"" He stopped dead in his tracks, then came over gave me a big hug! 

2. I was also wearing rainbow suspenders, with buttons on them (a la Mork). The buttons I had that day were S.H.I.E.L.D. and Hydra. My wife and I splurged and did the whole ceremony at Savi's and build lightsabers.

In clone wars this (Ahsoka's perspective) seems to happen in a few days maximum, yet on the begining of Revenge of the sith (right after the battle of corousant) Padme tells anakin shes pregnant (and even tho they seem to have not seen each other for a long time, she couldnt be more than 6 months pregnant), and the twins are born at the end of the movie, so several months have passed, yet in Ahsoka's perspective, its been only a few days max.

80,Thiughts on prequels versus sequels,1595309440,"Just mere opinion but I really wanted to share this 

TFA was fun to watch, but TLJ missed some sort of mark which is hard to explain(mainly due to overuse of comedy), and TROS completely went all over the place for me and singlehanded ruined the trilogy for me. Of course, the trilogy wasn’t great to begin with, but the movies were decently good and good on a movie basis(Except TROS).

That being said, even though the first two prequels were boring to watch at times, and had really bad dialogue a lot, I think they were better stories. They have solid explanations of the force and event as well as the complex politics. 

When I mean better stories, I don’t mean better movies, I just mean the broad storyline of Anakin’s tragic past. The sequels seemed really off by a mark and it wasn’t the movies themselves(except TROS), but just the planning and overall direction of the story. It also mirrored the OT a bit too much for my taste. 

The prequels fit in with the OT and build on it while the sequels gave a sort of fan fiction vibe, at least from Rey.

I think he would either put Anakin out of his misery finishing him off and ending probably the worst kind of pain and suffering, or if couldn’t go through with it he would at least wait with Anakin, through the suffering till the end so he wouldn’t have to die alone. Both of these would be devastating for Obi-Wan, but I think it’s something he would make himself bear for Anakin, a man that he called brother, even after the atrocities that he witnessed Anakin commit.

This isn’t a take I’ve heard from a lot of people, but it was kinda bothering me after rewatching ROTS.

46,What is it the CIS really wants?,1595291285,"The CIS as its name would suggest is a confederecy of different wants and desires as much as it is a confederacy of different planets and star systems. Three groups make up the CIS, the common people who have legimitate grievances against the Republic, the trade organizations and businesses who are both the cause and solution to the problems of the previous group, and the Sith who have spent a thousand years encouraging corruption and stagnation in the republic and funding pirates and terrorists in the outer rim so that they can use that to gain total control over the galaxy. 

At the lowest level of the Confederacy were the people and planets of the Outer Rim. Those who had true issues and grievances that the Core was just not focusing on. This is the group most people feel sympathy for when talking positively about the CIS. Though their issues were caused by the same corporations who would be fielding their armies and due to the machinations of the people responsible for the Republic refusing them aide they still dealt with many important issues. 

A [cut excerpt from the Essentail Guide to Warfare] (https://www.starwars.com/news/the-essential-guide-to-warfare-authors-cut-part-6-showdown-at-naboo) really nails down why many of these planets decided to join on their own. 

&gt;“  One year we ran six convoys to Kabal and had four of them taken by the pirates of Tertiary Fujar. We ransomed three of them; the Fujari took the fourth and sold the crew to Karazak slavers…..You never saw a Judicial hull past Kabal. Out here we had a government that couldn’t fight pirates; in Tamarin the government and the pirates were one and the same.

&gt;Then came the Bordal Contagion of 214 BBY. I don’t know what it was — some kind of plague that left people strangling on fluid in their lungs, awful stuff. I...he Fujari raided the first convoy, stripped the engines and the hyperdrives and set the transports adrift without power – six million doses ruined. The Republic did nothing.

&gt;The first thing the Federation did was bring in a flotilla of gunboats and system patrol craft via Svivren, backed up with a pair of Munifexes and a Captor. First trip to Kabal, the convoy hit an ice-asteroid screen and reverted to realspace at Tertiary Fujar. Here came the pirates, only this time they were looking down the barrels of a couple of dozen TDF guns

&gt;know things are different now. The Trade Federation runs Tamarin and Rseik sectors, and there are Neimoidian fingers in the ore trade and the crystals business. And spice, of course. Serving in the TDF, I’ve been ordered to do things that I wonder if I could explain while looking old Findal in the eye. But you have to understand what these sectors were like before the Trade Federation arrived. And if it were made to leave? Then there’d be no law at all.”

Pirates, slavers, plagues, lack of funds to upgrade equipment and just a general sense of abandonment by the Galaxy at large. Many of these planets like the ones in the excerpt had no choice but to join the Trade Federation or other CIS memeber states. While others were given no choice. 
While the people who needed the security of the CIS  wanted to promote a positive change the ruling Sepratist Council of the CIS such as the Trade Federation, Bactoid Armor Works, Techno Union, Intergalactic Banking clan and others had their own motivations for the war and what they wanted out of it. 

These groups, some of the same corporate monopolies Dooku would rail against in his Raxus Address, had been in contact with Dooku and the Sith planning the formation of the CIS and even the eventual war years before the Trade Federation’s invasion of Naboo.  For these corporations the formation of their own little spheres of influence away from the Republic was a chance to avoid taxation, working restrictions, increase the income for their CEO’s and board of directors, and run things as they saw fit without being held back by the Republic. 

The [trade summit at Eriadu] (https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Eriadu_Trade_Summit)  and the events leading up to it in the book [Cloak of Deception] (https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Cloak_of_Deception)  give a good example of what the Trade Federation and the other CIS leaders were doing to “convince” planets to join with them and what they wanted out of the whole affair. 

The summit was between the Trade Federation and the Republic and other minor Outer Rim powers in response to the growing threat of pirate attacks (secretly sponsored by the Sith and with full knowledge of the Trade Federation leadership)  in the rim and covering if the Trade Federation should be allowed to arm their ships to protect from pirates. 

Leading up to the summit the Trade Federation had been strong arming many smaller planets into joining them and giving up their voting rights. Basically telling the planets that the Trade Federation would either stop trading with them at all or start charging them for shipments destroyed by pirates unless they joined. And then when they joined the Trade Federation was given their vote in the senate as well as passing on any new taxes (such on trade routes) to their new member planets. 

During the summit the Sith had allowed a terrorist group known as the Nebula Front who were against the Trade Federation to get wind of the summit and attack it. Leading to the death of many of the leaders of the Trade Federation as well as making Chancelor Valorum and the Jedi look bad. The “failure” of the summit allowed the Trade Federation to upgrade their ships and create their droid armies. 

This is not the only case of the Trade Federation and other Sepretist ruling council members using pirates, threats (either to attack, raise taxes, or to pull out and leave planets to wither), terrorists, and other means to convince the planets in the outer rim to join with them. Unlike the common people this wasn’t a war of just grievances this was a war to expand their power and bank accounts without having to deal with pesky things like taxes or judicial oversight. Naboo’s entire invasion was simply because they wanted to renegotiate their contract with the Trade Federation and the TF’s dislike of taxations on the [free trade zones] (https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Free_Trade_Zone/Legends) that had been created post New Sith Wars to boost trade and industry in the outer rim. 

In fact the Trade Federation and other CIS leaders were opposed to the reforms on the free trade zones that would have “give startup companies in the Outer and Mid Rim, as well as small planetary business, greater control over trade in the outlying systems.” basically weakening their power in the outer rim. In short the Seperatist Council opposed the very things that would have helped the people they were representing. 

However all of this; the dissatisfaction of the common people, the greed of the corporations, the taxation of the trade zones and the corruption of the senate, were the designs of the Sith’s [Great Plan/Grand Plan] (https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Great_Plan). And unlike the common people and planets of the CIS who didn’t want to go to war the Sepratist Council and their Sith leaders were dead set on war.


1000 years in the making this plan was to corrupt the Galactic Republic from within, discredit and diminish the Jedi Order, and ultimately rule the galaxy.  While it may be a bit optimistic to say that all of the corruption and stagnation in the senate and hardships faced by the people in the outer rim were caused by a secret sith plot the vast majority of it was created or at least helped along by the Sith. The funding of pirates, the election of sympathetic senators and assassination of those deemed a threat, messing with the sith shrine below the Jedi Temple, and a vas number of other events including small proxy wars were all created by the sith to raise dissatisfaction with the Republic and weaken it from the inside. A good example of these is a conversation between Count Dooku and Tarkin in the [book of the same name] (https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tarkin_(novel)) 

The conversation being remembered in this part of the novel takes place around 33 BBY or a year before the battle of Naboo when Tarkin was still the elected leader of his planet of Eriadu. 

&gt;“Moving about in secrecy—some said one step ahead of assassins hired by Republic interests—Dooku became the focus of galactic attention, backing coups on Ryloth, meddling in the affairs of Kashyyyk, Sullust, Onderon, and many other worlds, and spurning all opportunities to negotiate with Supreme Chancellor Palpatine.” 

Here we have more evidence of the Sith’s meddling in the Republic as well as their desire for war. As will be shown in a moment even if the common people of the CIS wished for a peaceful seperation from the Republic Dooku and Sidious would not have allowed it as the war was needed for the final death blows to the Republic and the Jedi Order, as well as weakening the armies that they have been building up in the outer rim (because they don’t want to rule either the CIS or the Republic they want to rule one unified galaxy)

&gt;“Dooku went out of his way to meet with Tarkin on several occasions, as if to demonstrate that he had taken a personal interest in Eriadu’s future. In fact, having already laid the groundwork for the creation of a southern Separatist sphere by bringing Yag’Dhul and Sluis Van over to his side, he needed Eriadu to seal the deal. If Dooku could achieve in the Greater Seswenna what he had achieved elsewhere, he could effectively collapse the Core back into itself, reversing the expansion that had resulted from millennia of space exploration, conquest, and colonization.” 

Dooku’s interest in Eriadu like the CIS’s interest in any planet was just to further their own gain and power not for the true well being of the planet its self. 

&gt;“But on the occasion of their final meeting, threat replaced persuasion. Recent turmoil at Ando and Ansion had left the galaxy staggered, and Dooku seemed caught up in the feverish rush of events.” 

And here we see the snake for what it is. If Eraidu won’t join with the CIS then the CIS will force it to join. The Republic wasn’t just fighting to keep planets in the Republic (it being a republic their is the question of if a planet even has the legal rights to leave it) but to free planets that had been  forced to join the CIS against their own will. 

&gt;““An imminent crisis,” Dooku allowed. “I can’t say more. “But I can. I suspect that you are now close to persuading your secret allies to initiate an economic catastrophe.” Dooku’s response was limited to a faint smile, so Tarkin continued…..“Which is precisely why your world is so important to our cause,” Dooku said. “But sometimes economic pressures are not enough to guarantee success—as you well know, Governor. Or do you believe you could simply have bought off the pirates who harassed this sector for so long? Of course not. Eriadu established the Outland Regions Security Force to deal with them. You went to war.”

&gt;“Is war what you have in the works?”.....“Ah, but the end of his second term is upon him, Governor, with no one of any merit to succeed him. Unless, of course  some crisis results in his term being extended.”
Tarkin tried to decipher the count’s inference. “One might almost conclude that you’re positing an advantage to going to war. But how would that work? The volunteer security forces of the Confederate worlds against—what, Judicials and ten thousand of your former Jedi brethren?”
Dooku adopted an arrogant expression. “Don’t be too surprised, Governor, if the Republic has access to secret forces.”

&gt;Tarkin regarded him in open astonishment. “Mercenaries?”

&gt;“Proxies is perhaps a more accurate term.”

&gt;“Then you have already committed to war.”

&gt;I am committed to the idea of a galaxy ruled by an enlightened leader, with laws that apply universally—not one set for the Core Worlds, another for the Outer Rim worlds.”
Tarkin studied him. “Will there actually be a losing side for men like you and me? I sometimes suspect that this crisis is a mere charade.”

&gt;Dooku appraised him. “Would you be opposed to being part of a charade if it meant that the galaxy could be brought under the rule of one?”

Dooku lays it all out for Tarkin. That no matter what happens a war is going to happen, the armies have already been created for that. That the war is for a limited few at the end to help guide this new galaxy. Not one split between the rim and core like if the Sith allowed the CIS to leave peacefully but  one empire. 

So what is it that the CIS really wants? Well if you were a member of the thousands of star systems that broke away you were tired of the excessive taxation (much of which was passed down by the corporations) and corruption (caused by the sith) of the core and a feeling of abandonment. Or you were one of the planets forced to join the CIS due to lop sided trade deals by corporation like the Trade Federation of bribes and threats from Dooku and his leaders. 

If you were a member of the Seperatist council you want more power and money and your own little slice of the galaxy to run as you wish without having to deal with senate oversight. The Sith that have been helping the leaders of the Trade Federation and other groups have convinced them that years in advance that a war will come and that it is the only way to get you what you want. 

And if you are the Sith well you want it all. You want control over the entire galaxy and the destruction of the Sith. Except this time instead of training a lot of other sith and warriors to fight you are going to convince the galaxy to give it to you. Your kind have done everything they can over the last thousand years to corrupt the senate, blind the jedi, and stir strife in the outer rim. Now you have two opposing armies that will weaken and destabilize the galaxy until it asks you to take over and make it stop. The CIS is just a tool, one that is never meant to win the war, only to weaken the republic. 

While I do feel sympathy for the people of the outer rim and the common people who joined the CIS I feel like saying the CIS was really good or right or better than the republic is a narrow view and missing the bigger picture. The people themselves are good but the very problems they are protesting against and the very government they form would never have happened if it wasn’t for the meddling of the Sith and the influence of the same corporations they blame for running the Republic.

74,"The way Anakin Skywalker is portrayed in the first 20 minutes of Revenge of the Sith, is the way he should’ve been portrayed in Attack of the Clones.",1595286569,"At least I feel is what could’ve improved his story in the prequels. 

To start off I should probably say that Anakin Skywalker in ROTS is one my favorite characters in the franchise. I don’t like his child or AOTC portrayal but maybe cause ROTS was my first SW film I probably have a rose tinted way of viewing him. I always like his costume design and iconic look. 

Anyways, in ATOC, we only see the negative aspects of Anakin. We’re only presented his increasing frustration, anger, lack of discipline and respect, and extremely poor flirting skills! Anakin spend the whole time either socializing in an awkward way, or just complaining and going on and on about Obi-Wan and his teachings. As well I just going on anger filled rants. We don’t see anything positive/light hearted in his personality, other than maybe being a bit cocky during his car chase with the changeling. He’s definitely not the hero Obi-Wan greatly admired when speaking about him in A New Hope. 

But then in the opening scenes and first 20 minutes of ROTS we finally do get to see a more heroic and light hearted Anakin. The beginning shows his cute interactions with his beloved buddy R2, wit filled bromance with Obi-Wan, the need he feels to help out his fellow men/soldiers in battle, more humor, valiantly rescuing the Chancellor and then Obi-Wan as knowing that doing so would risk his death and everybody else’s, etc. 

We all can agree that Lanter’s Anakin is what we wish we saw in the films. At least for those of us who have seen the Clone Wars. And I feel like intro-ROTS Anakin is as close to that is we got from the films. Sadly however, Anakin’s portrayal goes back to awkward flirting with Padmé, and increasing frustration and anger towards the Jedi Council rather than just Obi-Wan. Constant complaint and venting.

Which COULD’VE worked, had we not seen a whole film previously of him doing this already. Personally I think Anakin should’ve acted the way he does intro-ROTS in entirety Attack of the Clones. While giving dashes of his negative emotions and feelings towards his situation instead of making them the main presentation of his character. It really sucks we never got see Lanter type of Anakin in the big screen for a long period of time. The great Clone War hero and friend Obi-Wan mentions. 

One big hope of mine is that in Kenobi TV series we get to see flashbacks of Anakin’s and Obi-Wan adventures during the Clone award, where Anakin maybe be portrayed in a lighter and heroic way. Rather than someone whose on the verge of going of a mass killing spree.

33,LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga (Discussion),1595276562,"Hi, you may or may not know that the newest SW game is being released later this year (Unofficially October 2020). Anyway, although this may have already been discussed before, I was just curious if we had any information across the internet to support any of the storylines/missions/characters to be that of the animation shows The Clone Wars &amp; Rebels.

Personally, I really enjoyed watching both shows over the years and would love to be able to play as some of the characters that were not in the major films. (One of them being Ahsoka Tano, cue the ""she's a good/bad character"" war)

Is there any possibility that stuff like this could be added? Even if some of the characters/missions were DLC as such. I reckon it could be a possibility, especially with the knowing that we can travel to any world in the galaxy within the game (If I am correct), it would make sense to be able to have access to more than those mentioned in the major films.

Let me know your opinions/thoughts on this my fellow StarWars &amp; gaming fans, please go easy on me. If this has already been discussed, then I will be more than happy to delete this post and look for the original one that has already talked about it!

Thank you and may the force be with you, always

76,Proof that Palpatine wasn't speaking through Snoke and that Snoke was his own entity.,1595269685,"&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sctwzc4922c51.jpg?width=1229&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa820c74212fe56038d59b2fcd084cc34444b948

First lets take the most important line of dialogue that Palpatine says in TROS:

""At last... Snoke trained you well, my boy. I made Snoke. I have been every voice... *\[as Snoke\]* ...you have ever heard... *\[as Darth Vader\]* ...inside your head.""

From this one line we can surmise the following:

\-When Palpatine says he ""made Snoke"" we see the cloning vats with various Snokes inside them which suggests that Palpatine had a hand in creating Snoke's flesh/body.

\-When Palpatine says ""I have been every voice...you have ever heard...inside your head"" the key thing to take from this dialogue is ***""inside your head""***. This suggests that Palpatine was never speaking through Snoke like a meat puppet as some may believe, but rather he was simply impersonating the voices of Snoke and Vader inside Ben's head. Vader's mask is proof of that, since we know it was Palpatine impersonating Vader's voice inside Ben's head and not the ghost of Anakin Skywalker speaking through the helmet.

If you also listen to the way Snoke speaks in TLJ - how he goes from speaking calmly to angrily scolding Kylo - this shows that Snoke is susceptible to angry outbursts, unlike Palpatine who is always calm and collected. This illustrates that they clearly have different personalities meaning that they're different entities/people.

Another piece of proof that Palpatine wasn't using Snoke as a meat puppet is that Palpatine could only move his essence between bodies that had his exact DNA, hence why he could only transfer to his Clone Body on Exegol. The only way Palpatine can enter a *non-Palpatine-DNA* body is through the Sith Ritual which is how he would've passed into Kylo Ren's body or even Luke's body if Luke had slayed him out of anger in the OT.

I can conclude that Palpatine and the Sith Eternal created Snoke's body with cloning/Sith Alchemy just like Palpatine/Sith Eternal had a hand in creating his own Clone Body on Exegol. This begs the question of who exactly was the entity of Snoke?

We know that Snoke had ""witnessed the rise and fall of the Galactic Empire"" which would mean he was alive during those times - possibly in a different body. The reason I think Snoke would have been in a different body comes from his line in ""The Rise of Kylo Ren"" comic series where he says ""***I was not born Snoke. I became Snoke.***"" This would suggest he was born with a different name and like I said possibly a different body and eventually something happened where his ""essence"" was transferred into the decaying body we see in the Sequel Trilogy.

Since Palpatine learned the technique of ""essence transfer"" which he used to enter his Clone Body on Exegol while falling down the shaft of the Death Star 2, maybe he was able to transfer a dark side entity (who witnessed the rise and fall of the Empire) into the Snoke body or maybe Snoke did it himself.

All of this mystery to me is what makes Snoke such an intriguing character. To summarize: Snoke is a separate person from Palpatine, however Palpatine/Sith Eternal created his body for his essence to reside in. The only question now is - who was Snoke before he became Snoke? Who was this person during the ""rise and fall of the Empire""? We may never know, and that's what also makes Star Wars great.",StarWars,skywalkinondeezhatrz,False,/r/StarWars/comments/huqoaz/proof_that_palpatine_wasnt_speaking_through_snoke/

Hypothesis 1: Yoda and the child's species age 1 human year every 50 calendar years
Quick math: at 900 calendar years old, Yoda's body had aged as much as an 18 year old human.

3,New to Star Wars,1595266595,"Growing up my dad and brother were really into Star Wars but I didn't know a lot of women who were into it, so I never gave it a chance. When the prequels came out i really didn't care, I was a kid and it felt like all the toys were for boys. Star Wars never felt like it was made for me.

I currently live with my boyfriend who is a HUGE Star Wars fan. I went with him to watch every episode of the Disney trilogy. While I liked Rey, Kylo Ren, and BB8 I didn't really see what all the fuss was about.

Last weekend I decided to watch the original trilogy and I get it!! It took 2 days for me to watch all 3 movies, and then I started watching The Mandalorian and I'm almost done with that too. I have never wanted to marathon anything before, but I feel like i can't get enough Star Wars.

""I am a Jedi, like my father before me."" BROKE ME. That entire scene had me ugly crying. 

I know I'm extremely late to this party but im glad I found these movies!! The original trilogy is not just a great story,  its a great story that needed to be told on the big screen.",StarWars,chorpotin,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hupnyz/new_to_star_wars/

I don’t see the fascination. He just is a darth Vader wannabe who turned to the dark side for...looking badass? He comes off as a whiny grown man who is also a psychopath. Not to mention that he practically loses in the first film, “you were bested by a girl who’s never held a lightsaber”. This completely makes him unintimidating and a horrible villain all-around

Granted darth Vader liked massacring too, but I think Vader speaks for himself as to why he is complex, a walking metal man who is constantly held together by his hate and sorrow. He turned to the dark side in attempt save padme. 

Darth Vader: Turned to the dark side to accumulate power and save the one he loved

Darth Revan: Turned to the dark side to to take over the galaxy and unite it under one banner in order to repel a greater threat that waited lurking in the unknown regions.

Count Dooku: Turned to the dark side because he recognized the innumerable amount of flaws in the Republic and Jedi Order

• Weirdly releasing the film in May instead of the fall right after Avengers: Infinity War.

• The distrust from fans after the fallout of the divisive The Last Jedi released just five months earlier. 

All in all, people have a bad taste in their mouth for Solo because of the timing and it being “a movie no one asked for.”

However, the film is awesome. Alden does an incredible job embodying the “spirit” of Han Solo without just churning out a subpar impression. The dialogue is a little crunchy, the acting misses a few steps, the plot takes predictable and nonsensical turns...

34,Not So Hot Take. 1-2-3-4-5-6 is a bad way to introduce someone to Star Wars.

And even the Machete Order requires some cinematic style jumps, which I think are not in the best interest of a ""new subject"". 

This post comes from seeing some new reactions on youtube, and from my personal experience showing this Saga to some friends. 

I believe that release order makes the most sense in every way, not only in terms of world building, but also in terms of emotional attachment to the characters. 

You NEED to see Vader die and redeemed before you see how he came to be. Especially when Revenge of the Sith was made upon that premise.

36,"Anakin Skywalker and Darth Vader are not separate entities, and I feel people take the symbolism of it too literally.",1595219040,"This may be an opinion piece since everyone has there own interpretation of star wars and it's lore. I feel there is a growing subset of fans who have grown to believe that Darth Vader and Anakin Skywalker are literally two different beings, and it's just something I don't get. This seems to come from criticism of the sequel trilogy never mentioning Anakin skywalker's name despite the fact that he was a villian( a tragic one at that). 

There is a clear symbolism of Vader distancing him self from his past Jedi ways as its him separating himself from everything he has done and lost. He can't feel that pain if he's not Anakin anymore. Anakin has such weaknesses, but Vader doesn't (At least that's my interpretation). While I'm aware  the Dark Side can have almost complete control of it's user, I don't  think there's anything in the lore that states it creates a new being entirely (If there is I'll like to be corrected). As introduced in Return of the Jedi, and expanded upon in other mediums, one can overcome the dark side as Vader did but at the same time, it is up to the force user by his own will to want to succumb to it as Anakin did to save the ones he loved but his arrogance and lose of faith in the Jedi blinded his path. It's why Vader says to Luke in Empire Strikes Back ""No, I am your Father"" not ""Yes, I killed your Father"". 

I know a lot of people grew up with Anakin from prequel era and have latch on to the chosen one narrative as they want him to be resolved from all his actions from the Original trilogy ( Which is surprising as I thought Darth Vader is as famous as James Bond or Spider-Man, everyone and their grandmothers know about the character even if they've never seen a Star Wars Movie), but I feel going with the whole two separate beings is just reaching too far in my opinion. Fans are also trying to do a similar thing with Kylo Ren and Ben Solo, but the narrative in those moves where a bit too disjointed for me to care too much.

Baby Yoda's true age is 50 years old.
Yoda's true age (when he died) was 900 years old.

If you move the decimal point at the end of each of these ages one place to the left, then the last digit reveals how old they really look.

50 ---&gt;5.0 Years old
900---&gt;90.0 Year old

You may then wonder about other ages that Yoda's species would really look like, especially Yoda during Empire Strikes Back and even Phantom Menace.

AOTC-874---&gt;87.4
ROTS-877---&gt;87.7
ANH-896---&gt;89.6
TESB-899---&gt;89.9
ROTJ-900---&gt;90.0

5---&gt;0.5
98---&gt;9.8
100---&gt;10.0
752---&gt;75.2
811---&gt;81.1

The cinematography and what they did was phenomenal. You couldn’t do it 10 years ago, you couldn’t even do it 5 years ago. The Death Star in all its beautiful and destructive glory brings a tear to my eye. Rogue One holds the perfect amount of sentimental nostalgia, and just enough of something new to make it refreshing. 

Fully fleshed out characters like Jyn, K2SO, Cassian, and of course Mads Mikkelsen’s Galen Erso are truly what raise this above the rest. Such amazing characters. I mean come on, Star Wars with Mads Mikkelsen is insane!

I was so excited for the Disney movies and while there have been some missteps, I still really like them. 

But I also spent my 90’s and 2000’s reading all the EU stories, and if Disney can take a step back and start to use some of the story lines that became “my Star Wars sequels”, I would love it.

* Thrawn Trilogy - Hello Mara Jade! 

* Jedi Academy

* Outbound Flight ( Prequel Prequel) 

* Lando and Han and Chewie as young smugglers

80,Could the Mortis arc better tie in the purpose of the Sequel Trilogy?,1595199285,"This might be a bit long, but it’s worth it. Please stay with me on this! Mortis explains the sequels, their connection to the original six, and provides a definitive ending in a more wholistic manner when thinking about 9. 

I think Mortis added a potentially powerful element to Star Wars and further emphasizes that the force is the power that guides the galaxy no matter what - the sequels being no exception. So the theory starts with what the father told Anakin. He MUST, as the chosen one, replace the father and control the daughter and son to maintain balance in the force and in the galaxy through this kind of elemental triangular relationship. Anakin doesn’t, they both die, and consequentially Anakin falls to the dark side a few years later. The force is then rippled and imbalanced. When Anakin redeems himself, he himself becomes balanced which would mean the galaxy would then logically be restored to balance. However the only issue is that Anakin dies in Luke’s arms on the Death Star 2 almost immediately after. Thus, this creates another ripple in the force almost immediately after one was closed because their is no “father” (overseer) to maintain order. Now enter the sequels. We all know about the big dyad revelation, but why does it come to be? If we look at Ren and Rey through the lense of Mortis, we could say Rey was a symbolic manifestation of the Daughter (light side, but never really a Jedi) and Ren being a manifestation of the son (dark side but never really a sith). Their shared bond and experience through the events of 7 and 8, after Rey realizes she’s force sensitive, not only brings them personally closer, but creates a dyad in the force. Two opposite ends that are one. Thus, closing the bridge, or need, for a father to maintain order between the dark son and light daughter for the galaxy and force itself to be balanced. Now how does this play into 9? When Palpatine emerges and tries to roll out his contingency plan, the criteria for balance still has yet to be met because they themselves don’t realize that they are indeed a dyad in the force. When Rey realizes who her family is, and what her and Ben share (dyad) only then does the process of restoring balance, without the need of a father, begin. Palpatine and remnants of the sith on Exegol are an outlier that prevent this galaxy from being restored. Therefore through the force, it would have been necessary that Ben would HAVE to join Rey to defeat Palpatine for this dyad to restore balance. And they do, albeit not in the way one might expect. Ben HAD to arrive on Exegol when he did or else Rey would have killed Palpatine and ascended to the dark side as empress. That is the purpose his part of the dyad serves in balance. Rey then, with the Jedi of the past by her side, kills her grandfather, the sith loyalists, and the dark side. Gives a deeper meaning to Anakin’s “Bring back the balance as I did,” moment too. She serves her purpose and then dies. Ben resurrects her (while dying in the process) leaving her as the sole survivor of the dyad and of the figures at hand the force uses to bring order in the galaxy. And it shows in her resulting actions. She buries the Jedi lightsabers, and emerges with a yellow saber, symbolic of a more neutral and balanced force user as opposed to those who dawn red, blue, green, or even purple sabers. She probably doesn’t even know this, nor did Ben, Palpatine, etc. but that is what the force WIELDED. The force guides the galaxy and the sequel trilogy is about how the force eliminated the triangular relationship of a good, bad, and grey figure needed to maintain order. Rey is the sole survivor. She is no Jedi. The “Jedi Rey,” dies on Exegol. The Sith die on Exegol. These ancient religions in the Star Wars universe die with the Skywalker saga and now the galaxy only has one thing: the force and those who use it. No good, no evil. Just balance in each and everyone of the galaxys occupants through the force. It’s like poetry, everything connects by dissecting how Mortis is applicable to the relationship of Rey’s  and Ben’s journeys.",StarWars,antb12,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hu9zxl/could_the_mortis_arc_better_tie_in_the_purpose_of/

I'm not here to start a flame war on which cannon is better Disney or Legends, in fact, I never read a Star Wars novel until just recently (That book being 1996's The New Rebellion by Kristine Kathryn Rusch).  I knew about the Galaxy of Fear book series as they had them in my old elementary school's library, but I never read any of them, and then in junior high I tried to read 1997's Specter of the Past however I stopped reading when I found it was a squeal to the original Thrawn Trilogy. The book's in my possession at the time being is Han Solo and the Lost Legacy (1980),Heir to the Empire (1991),Dark Force Rising\* (1992) (\*My copy is a very used copy) and The New Rebellion (1996). I've felt that getting into the Legends is very daunting since we live in a post Disney Star Wars world. As someone who's lived threw the Prequels, Clone Wars and Disney its tricky to find a good jumping on point for these novels. As someone who never got to live threw the dark age of Star Wars (1987-1991) I had no contention to these novels. I'm reading them with a fresh perspective in 2020, and yes I'm aware of the less loved story's by fans like The Jedi Prince,Courtship of Princess Leia,The Crystal Star and Children of The Jedi.

Luke made the choice to redeem Anakin, and from that, chose to train Rey and encourage her to go to Exegol and fight. Anakain's redemption paved the way for this. 

&amp;#x200B;

Luke's work and choices were dependent on nobody, and made it even though Obi discouraged him in ROTJ. Luke was the one who fixed the mistakes of the Jedi in TLJ and learned about what the force really is and what balance really means. He even trained Leia who helped Rey and brought Ben back.  You could argue that he would't have got back in the fight if not for Yoda, but Yoda and the Jedi learned how they fucked up from Luke himself, who instilled in Rey that the Jedi were with her, and allowed her to defeat Palpatine. 

Yoda even said in Revenge of the Sith that the prophecy might have been misread. Obi-Wan even said to Maul that Luke was the chosen one.

In my opinion, the Sequels did a great job of adding to the chosen one prophecy without spelling it out, and it's better that way, since all the info was there. 

&amp;#x200B;

I genuinely think that the sequels are brilliant and add to the prequels, and that a lot of people that complain about plotholes are too used to being spoonfed info, no offence.

95,Recently finished Episodes 1-6+Clone wars in machete order.,1595123633,"So on May the 4th, got Disney+, started with episode 4, then 5, 1-2, then TCW, having never seen the show, seen the movies (Except AOTC) several times. I saw nearly the whole series, skipped like 8 episodes. Then ROTS+Siege of Mandalore, then Maul's episodes in Rebels, finished with ROTJ. Whole thing took about 2 months. Just thought I'd share my thoughts:

ANH is still great, but... it's paced a bit slow. The third act makes up for it though. ESB is the best of the OT. A masterpiece. 

TPM... I like it despite its flaws. The Senate stuff is actually interesting. AOTC... I wanted to like it, but the romance felt forced and overshadowed the decent parts. 

TCW is brilliant. Once season 2 came around, I was sold. This show does what the prequels couldn't do with just 3 movies. It made Anakin an amazing character, gave us Fives, Maul, Ahsoka... amazing.

ROTS is the best of the prequels. The action is great,  plot paced perfectly. TCW added so much to all the characters. Not amazing, but a good conclusion to the prequels.

I only saw a bit of Rebels, but Twilight of the Apprentice and Twin Suns are the best of Star Wars. Maul is now one of my favorite characters, and I wanted to see how his story ended.

ROTJ was my introduction to Star Wars, so I have a soft spot for it. Already a great movie, but seeing it as the culmination of the prequels and TCW...brings it to another level.

Overall, I'd say this is a great way to see Star Wars, really lets you appreciate the world, themes, and characters.I wanted to see all the pre-Disney stuff first, but soon I'll get to Mandalorian and the sequel trilogy. 

P.S. Rogue one before ANH would be a perfect first movie, and introduction to Vader. Something to keep in mind for machete order. Also, you can skip more TCW episodes than I did and still see the good stuff.",StarWars,ponder421,False,/r/StarWars/comments/htskkq/recently_finished_episodes_16clone_wars_in/

Maul kills Qui Gon who was the only jedi on Palatines tail he would of found it out and Star Wars would of never happened or he would of trained Anakin and he wouldn’t of become Vader. I can go even further. When Maul captures Grievous and Dooku instead of killing them like he threatened Sidious to he teamed up with Dooku and then betrayed him if he didn’t betray him Dooku wouldn’t of angered Anakin during their fight in rots and Anakin’s anger wouldn’t of been achieved if Maul didn’t lose Dooku wouldn’t of been Sidious’s apprentice. I have one more peace of evidence that shows Maul is the most important character in all of Star Wars. Ahsoka went after Maul in clone wars season 7 and if she didn’t she may of been able to turn Anakin back to the light.,StarWars,Daredevil12345678910,False,/r/StarWars/comments/htr3tb/why_darth_maul_is_the_most_important_star_wars/

The old republic era in particular stands out better than the three main movie trilogies but that’s just my opinion.

30,"The last jedi is good, change my mind",1595114341,"TLJ is probably the movie that ruined the sequel trilogy for many people, the main reason being the treatment of Luke Skywalker himself. I agree that he was far from the person we all know and love at the start of the movie, but he gets ""redeemed"" and becomes himself again throughout the span of the movie (in a beautiful and underrated way). The scene with Luke and Leia is heartwarming.

Leia and Poe was excellent in this movie, and The First Order chasing the Resistance to the point that there were only a handful of them left was really cool.

Kylo and Rey's force connection is great, and has a lot of character development for both Rey and Ben. It's also veey unique and is something we haven't really seen in Star Wars before (maybe in legends).

Chewie flying The Millenium Falcon on crait was amazing to see.

Snoke being killed was unexpected and made me more hyped to see Kylo Ren in episode 9, being supreme leader.

I will never understand why people hate Rose, she was just an addition to the main crew which in my opinion was just fine. She wasn't an amazing character, but I didn't find one reason to dislike her watching the movie.

And I agree that it was a missed oppurtunity to not see Han, Luke, and Leia togheter in the sequel trilogy, but their stories are already told in the original trilogy. The sequels isn't a Star Wars reuinion, it's a continuation of the saga.

With that said I love all trilogies, and I also understand people who don't.

42,A nice character detail about Ben Solo in TLJ,1595110395,"I'm probably not the first to theorize this, but after rewatching TFA and TLJ in quick succession, I noticed that something Ben says while 'Force-Skyping' with Rey in TLJ is something of a Freudian slip on his part.

Some background: In TFA, Leia says that she never should have sent Ben away to train with Luke, as that is what caused her to 'lose' both him and Han, implying that Han didn't want him to be sent away and Ben resented them for sending him away. Luke reinforces what Han's feelings were in TLJ when he says ""*Han was... Han about it*"".

In TLJ, in response to Rey saying that she doesn't understand why Ben killed his father, Ben responds ""*No? Your parents threw you away like garbage.*"" Although he is directing it at Rey to chastise her for relying on her parents, IMO this actually reveals what he feels his own parents did to him, and explains why he cynically assumes that Rey's parents also abandoned her. I like it as a subtle detail that may or may not be intentional but explains a good deal about Ben's motivation to become Kylo Ren.

Obviously we find out two films later perhaps why. A very aggressive style with almost a fencing style, forward lunges etc. I am not sure if Rey was always written in as Palpatine's grand daughter or if this was something decided after this film, but was interesting to see.

97,Most heartbreaking moment in all of Star Wars?,1595096810,"I want to know what reddit's opinion is on the most heartbreaking moment in all of Star Wars. This includes moments from the movies, Rebels/Clone Wars TV series, or from the books.

For me, the most heartbreaking moment would have to be the death of Kanan Jarrus/Caleb Dume. Throughout the series, especially in the last 2 seasons, you really start to connect with how important he is to all of the Ghost Crew. He's not just a leader, but a father figure, especially to Sabine and Ezra.

A close second would have to be Anakin's betrayal/turn to the dark side. Everyone knew it was coming, but it still hurts, especially when you know that he wasn't fully lying when he said the Jedi were evil.
