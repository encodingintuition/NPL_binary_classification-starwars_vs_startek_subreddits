14,!!No spoilers please!! Star Trek:Picard and other new Trek projects,1597865005,"Quite ranty and rambly.

What is the real story with newer Trek series and films?

I was born in '93 and I'm definitely from the ""modern"" side of Star Trek. I saw bits of episodes when I was younger when my dad watched it - although he seemed to think that TNG was called Enterprise and so far as I can tell, has never really watched any other Trek apart from TNG.

My first real foray into Star Trek was the first of the modern Kelvin Movies.

I'm also a weird one where I like to follow the Chronology of the story as opposed to chronology of release.

Part of that is I find some of the older tropes hard to engage with unless I have a ""stake"" in it. 

I previously tried to watch TOS but didn't engage well with it until after I'd watched Enterprise, although it did rob me of some throwbacks like &gt;!Archer/Kirk and Rura Penthe!&lt;

I've since watched Enterprise, Discovery, TOS, The Original Cast movies, TNG, Generations, and I'm currently on DS9 and Voyager and, following [This chronology](https://overmental.com/content/the-definitive-chronological-viewing-order-for-the-star-trek-cinematic-universe-42395) I will be watching First Contact tonight. 

I actually made the push to go further with my watching due to the release of Picard, because I wanted to be up to speed before seeing it. 

I didn't want to miss anything, any jokes or references, by watching Picard first, so I got cracking and went further into TNG era and the movies over lockdown. 

I ""accidentally"" watched the first episode when my dad put it on.

I can definitely see what people mean when they say that Modern Trek isn't the same as old Trek. 

I personally don't think it's that big an issue and appreciate them for what they are. 

I feel that series need to evolve to remain relevant and watchable, but I can understand where people are coming from when they say they don't recognise the newer shows. 

In my opinion its the degree of that evolution which is in question rather than the evolution itself, but I feel that a lot of these shows are good enough to stand on their own in the Star Trek Universe. 

Continual comparisons to prior series doesn't help. IMO, TNG is about as far from TOS as Enterprise is from TNG, and likewise with Discovery being removed from TNG and Enterprise. 

Especially when people refer to stuff that they first saw as a kid - nothing will ever compare.

But that doesn't make them bad.

Admittedly, I haven't seen enough of Picard to make a proper comparison, but most of the people that I've seen complaining about it admit that they didn't actually watch it - they just expect it to be bad and thus don't.

And with Lower Decks - it doesn't look ""Star Trek enough"" from the 5 minutes worth of trailers they've seen and therefore they refuse to even give it a chance.

But Picard and Discovery are both viewed as abject failures by many people - yet both have consistently good ratings from viewers and critics, with some slight hiccoughs, and viewership patterns no different from any new series - there is always a decent drop off from the first couple of episodes. 

DIS Season 1 has an approval rating of 83% with an episode average of 87% and Season 2 has an 81% approval and 82% episode average for season. Picard has an approval rating of 87% with an episode average of 85%.

It appears to be doing well. 

I think that part of the perceived failure or success has to do with how reviews are done these days for TV, Movies and Games. 

For a 1 to 10 scale of reviews 5 should be the average - if something isn't objectively bad, has a couple of niggles, and isn't massively great either, ie it is distinctly average, then it should have a 5 rating. 

But these days its expected to have a rating of 8 or 9, anything less than 8.5 and there must be something terribly wrong with the game. 

I am very supportive of the average quality of entertainment increasing, but the review weighting should change to reflect that. 

It does make it hard to judge the 80-90% positive reviews, considering that it has to somehow be overwhelmingly bad to get below 50%?

But equally, when people use 50% to reflect the average instead of 80%, this penalises good shows because they don't have that 90% positive rate. 

The classic example of TV shows is with Fox, where they pay for a show to be made, end up with a good show, then broadcast the episodes in the order they think is best as opposed to the order that they were made to be shown, and then wonder why they don't get the best reviews possible because some stuff is confusing, then they cancel the show - see Firefly and Almost Human, among others. 

I hope that the perceived failure of Picard isn't because newer watchers, like me, were turned away because they didn't have a lot of trek background knowledge.  

I agree somewhat with assessments that, unfortunately, star trek just doesn't perform well at the box office and therefore feature films aren't really the way to go from the perspective of advancing the story or the brand.

I think that there is a demographic which will never watch anything trek because ""Star Trek is for Nerds"" and 

But I see them going one of 3 ways with the shows.

1. Go more ""traditional"" trek to placate current fans at the possible expense of new ones
2. Continue as they are
3. Go *slightly* less traditional than they are to try and get more new people to watch it.

I don't think they'd go much further away from trek because they simply can't entice those who will never watch it.

But any other change than what they have now and I don't think the viewership will survive and Trek will be off the air again for the foreseeable future.

19,Deep Space Nine Upscale Project Update: What I've Been Working On,1597860350,"Howdy folks, 

It's been a few months since I made a meaningful project update, and I didn't want for it to seem like I'd quit / given up. I've been quite busy the last couple months playing with DS9's frame rate and the various methods for interpolating and duplicating frames in order to shift the show to other, higher speeds. I've also explored various methods of repairing the 29.97 fps sections at 23.976 fps by, for example, accelerating the show via certain tactics, then trimming it \*back\* to 23.976 fps using others. 

This is more of a WIP report than a declaration of a major milestone. It includes video of what the repaired, upscaled 29.97 @ 23.976 fps content currently looks like, as an illustration of what I'm trying to improve/fix. I've been focused more on motion than on strict image quality, so I don't have major IQ improvements to show just at the moment. I have, however, ripped one episode of TV off DVD more than 250x to examine the impact of various encoder settings in applications like Handbrake, so... I guess there's that? 

Anyway. Questions are welcome, if you've got 'em. Here's the latest:

32,"Long Time Star Trek Fan Finally Watches Voyager: Season 1, episode 3 or 4 through 5 I think? How did I already lose track of the numbers?",1597841525,"Time and Time Again: the way Janeway just flippity flopped on the Prime Directive was a little annoying. She could have, ya know, at least told Paris what she was doing. But she just did it in such a ridiculous way that of course they weren’t gonna believe her! I don’t know what she expected out of that situation. 

This is minor but I LOVED the outfits in this episode.

The continuity in Voyager doesn’t seem like it’s gonna be too great. Time travel on Star Trek is always a lil dicey, but this entire episode, by its own admission, should not have happened. That said, I sort of love the scene they chose to open and close with, where Paris is trying to convince Kim to cheat on his girlfriend. Those are the scenes I find revealing about the characters. 

Kes’s telepathy was almost interesting and then did nothing for the plot. In fact, most half this plot was wasted time since Janeway and Paris solved their problem themselves.

Phage: Welp, guess his lungs are just gone. There they go. Woosh!

Neelix is still super annoying. It’s like the new Quark. You guys are gonna get sick of me saying that.

I love the Doctor’s sense or humor. “Don’t worry, I’m not going to kiss you.” Also, the joke where Paris says that the holographic lungs wouldn’t be real so the Doctor slaps him is SO well executed. Definitely diminished when he actually explained the point.  I usually miss jokes like that but it was just perfect in allowing me to get it. Man for all that he knows about medicine he was not taught crap about mental health. Which is weird considering DS9’s discussions around depression, anxiety and PTSD. He had no idea what to do when Neelix panicked aside from sedate him completely. Oh but he has his moments. He’s like Data but a little more human and a lil more of an ass.

I love Paris as a medic. Way better bedside manner than the doctor himself, willing to learn, giving him 100% 100% of the time. 

The medical ethics on this episode are a MESS! I guess Kes is at least his significant other and marriage is a human concept, but... why was she the one who could decide? Why wasn’t treatment stopped when he asked? Why did the doctor ignore him when he said he was getting claustrophobic? What made the doctor think it was ethical to leave him there, alone, to sit in silence for hours? Because just for the record, it IS unethical to leave a conscious patient alone in silence with nothing to do, especially if they aren’t able to do anything about it/move. That’s not just my opinion, that was taught in my nursing assistant class. 

Oh JESUS. I’m writing this while I watch and I don’t know why I wasn’t expecting Frankenstein’s Monster but I wasn’t expecting it. The makeup on this show...

Ah Kes will probably make a better medic than Paris. But I loved watching Paris work with the doctor. Neelix does seem to fit as the chef. 

The Cloud: uh... Neelix does have a point, that it’s a funny way to show someone you care about them by tossing them in front of a buss every five minutes and hoping you threw them hard enough to make it to the other side. That said, I love Janeway’s optimism and the heart of exploration. The nature of exploration is that you don’t know what you’re going to find. Of course it’s dangerous! And they have to replenish these supplies they lost somehow!

This is one of those episodes where I think once they did the harm, it was best to leave it where they had. They hurt the creature. That’s a terrible thing to have done, but they had no way to know that would happen. 

“Paris! Did you program this guy? He’s a pig and so are you.” I don’t like Paris’ holoprogram but I like half Klingon’s reaction to it. And I also find it a LITTLE lazy to write Paris’ program in France. After Vic, or pretty much any of Riker’s programs, this one is boring. 

Janeway’s log was a little cliche. But the whole thing is so inherently optimistic. She spends the whole log musing on how to be a better leader/resource for her crew. She never once talks about how it’s lonely for her not to feel connected- she is entirely trying to figure out what they need her to be. And I totally loved Kim checking in to see what she needed, if she needed people to be with that night. This is actually a flaw in Picard. He has such a noble stature to him that you can’t imagine what he was ever like at a lower rank. You know he had one because he tells stories. But he is well suited to the prideful isolation that comes with being captain and his friends are the upper ranks. Janeway gave up her mess hall to be a kitchen. She is listening and learning from what her crew needs.

But when you go through each episode, it's clear to see that sexy time was a driving force in most of the episodes. I've seen people on here try to obfuscate this fact in various ways (""Kirk wasn't actually that much of a ladies man"""", for example), but the attempt to do so is silly. Let's go through the most notable episodes, SHALL WE?!

* The Man Trap: All about an alien who eats the salt of horny crewman.
* Mudd's Women: The crew of the Enterprise again turns into a sweaty puddle in front of Mudd's chemically enhanced mail-order brides.
* What Are Little Girls Made Of?: First of all, gross title. Also, en epsiode about a renowned scientist hiding from society to make and/or enhance sex robots (*especially* Ruk..and yes, I know Ruk was there before him).
* Dagger of the Mind: Dr. Noelle and Kirk's sexual tension is a constant in the episode.
* Consience of the King: Kirk uses his sexy powers to try and extract information from Lenore

* Shore Leave: **Everyone** had sex on that planet. **EVERYONE**. Look at the end of that episode and tell me that's not intense after sex glow.
* Court Martial: Shaw was so deprived of Kirk's loins, she counted down **to the day** the last time they banged.

* Amok Time: Spock is so horny he either has to bang his wife or kill whatever stands in his way from banging his wife. Also probably got down with Chapel in that episode, but that's up for debate.
* Who Mourns for Adonais?: A bizarre ""thirst triangle"" between Apollo, Scotty, and Lt. Palamer.
* The Apple: The Enterprise crew save *an entire civilization* by teaching them how to bang.
* Catspaw: Kirk again uses his just unimpeachable sex appeal to stop an alien menace. 
* I, Mudd: More sex robots. *Thousands* of sex robots. 

* Metamorphosis:  Landing party is saved after they convince a cloud to become human so it can bang Cochrane. 
* Friday's Child: Pregnant woman is so thirsty, she wants into McCoy's pants *while she is pregnant*. 
* The Deadly Years: Like Court Martial, another woman from Kirk's past who is so thirty for more of him, she kept track down to the exact day how long ago they rumbled in the sheets. 
* A Private Little War: Witch doctor who makes guys horny so she can get her way.

* By Any Other Name: The Enterprise crew save themselves and the galaxy by teaching aliens that booze and sex are awesome. 
* The Enterprise Incident: Spock takes a page from Kirk and uses his sexiness to dupe a Romulan Commander. 
* Wink of an Eye: Again, more of Kirk using his mojo (with actual sex this time) to help save his crew.
* Elaan of Troyius: Another woman using her chemical composition (tears) to make men's blood rush out of their brains. 
* All Our Yesterdays: Spock considers literally abandoning the Enterprise and his timeline so he can bang his hot cave lady.

75,Prime Directive question about helping slaves who were imported to a planet,1597792315,"I hope this post is okay here ... 

Say a Starfleet ship encounters a warp-capable society which once imported alien slaves in their past. The slaves were semi-freed at one point in their history but have since been re-enslaved. The slaves have psionic powers which the slavers consider to be a nuisance, but they also have scientific prowess which has accelerated the slavers' development. One of the slaves sends a psionic S.O.S. to the crew. 

Can the Starfleet ship interfere? If the PD is currently ""in the way"" what adjustment would you make to make this adventure ""PD clean""?

My reasons for thinking they can interfere:

- Matters on this planet no longer fall under ""natural evolution"" or ""natural development"" because they have diverged from their nature by importing slaves with special abilities.
- It's not a purely ""internal affair"" because the exploited people are not from this world. 
- It's not ""supporting one faction over another"" because the slaves have no rights or political power of any kind, therefore they are not a ""faction"".

Reasons why it might still invoke the PD:

- There is an element of helping a society escape the negative consequences of its actions.
- There is an element of subverting the application of a society's laws.

I appreciate any help. I'm writing an RPG adventure for some friends and I don't want the PD to get in the way, so I'm hoping that an analysis of the two lifeforms (showing they didn't co-evolve) will blow the PD concern out of the water.",startrek,AstroMacGuffin,False,/r/startrek/comments/icc0xh/prime_directive_question_about_helping_slaves_who/

As for Enterprise, the characters would be pretty old, but according to Wikipedia, Archer dies only 20 years before the start of TOS.

I think the decompressed storytelling is a mistake though. Too much of the focus is on the drama, not enough on the essential Star Trek elements which would be there in a more episodic format where each episode was obliged to be about something. Picard is not obliged to be about anything in any given episode it just has to have stuff happen that moves the ongoing plot a little further down the line. 

I know the response I'm going to get ""Just keep watching"" ""It will all make sense."" ""It will get better"" ""Somehow watching the later episodes negates everything you're saying right now."" 

Well it doesn't, it doesn't change the fact that in an old Star Trek show, four episodes would have yielded at least three stories.

90,Rediscovering Discovery,1597782461,"For your consideration my thoughts. First off, English is not my native language so bear with me please. 

When I first watched the entire run of Discovery I was a bit underwhelmed by it all. Now three years later after the premiere of the Vulcan hello I decided to watch it for a second time. I now know why I was underwhelmed. It had to do with the unfamiliarity with Discovery and its crew and the excitement I felt about watching a new series. I realized that I no longer know what it is (or how it feels like) to watch a star trek series that I am not familiar with. For example if I rewatch TNG I revisit good old captain Picard and know that he is going to do what he does best. I know how data will react to situations and that’ll make me grin with nostalgia and thus familiarity. Same goes for DS9 and VOY (and heck, even ENT).

Now as I am rewatching discovery I have the same feelings of familiarity which actually helps me enjoy it more. I am no longer on the edge of my seat too busy searching for references to other trek (or just excited that there is a new trek series) but am just enjoying it for what it is. I even see that Discovery is more Star Trek then I realized on my first watch. It has the same elements and messages TNG or DS9 had. Ofcourse it is more serialized but I even like it that way. 

I think that I am trying to say that I simply enjoy it more rewatching it because I myself am more relaxed watching it. Does that make any sense? Do you have the same experience?",startrek,cartermanner,False,/r/startrek/comments/ic90fg/rediscovering_discovery/

94,My rough outline for a new Star Trek series of stories. Looking for feedback and suggestions.,1597778870,"The following is a rough outline for a new Star Trek series of stories that I have been working on.  Feedback and suggestions are welcome!


Time period:  After the Next Generation/DS9/Voyager timeframe.  The Dominion War and Borg Incursions of the late 24th century have been resolved as have a brutal war against an alien aggressor called the Shrike.  The Shrike appeared to not travel through space in a conventional fashion, but rather by materializing out of subspace within Federation territory.  Starfleet was already depleted after conflict with the Dominion and the Borg and, as a result, suffered heavy losses to the Shrike.  Many surviving Starfleet personnel have some variety of PTSD and can have difficulty in allowing themselves to get close to others.


What's going on:  The Federation is in desperate straights.  They need to convince the rest of the Alpha and Beta quadrant governments that they remain strong and can conduct business as usual.  To appear weak would be to invite further aggression for traditional Federation antagonists such as the Romulans or the Tholians.  As such, many older decommissioned ships are pulled out of mothballs at places such as the Qualor II Surplus Depot and pressed into service to continue Starfleet's mandate to explore ""Strange New Worlds"".  Secretly, Starfleet Admirals are ordering starship captains to forge new alliances with any powerful civilizations encountered. 


The Ship:  The Miranda-class USS Hiawatha.  This elderly ship was decommissioned 40 years prior and has been biding it's time at the Zakdorn Qualor II Depot.  Despite needing modernization, this rather unremarkable ship is being pressed into service to explore the distant R'allanthan Reach beyond Cardassian space.  An unmanned probe had been sent to the Reach several decades prior and had detected strange, high powered energy readings before contact was lost.  Analysis indicates that the energy signature may have been an attempt at friendly communication by an advanced civilization.


The Crew:  

Captain Timonius (Timonium?) Drago.  Young captain who wanted to resign from Starfleet after the Shrike Incursion.  Has a hard time remembering crewmen's names since there was little point getting to know someone during the war as casualties were so high.  Swarthy and Italian.  Will eventually let people call him ""Tim"" as he let's his guard down.  Is straight and will explore love interests as able.


Cardassian Glinn Science Officer.  Either Male or Female.  Assigned to the Hiawatha as part of an exchange program with the Cardassian High Command.  Will prove himself/herself as highly competent and intelligent.  Will eventually want to resign Cardassian commission and join Starfleet.  If female, could be argumentative with Capt. Drago as she is attracted to him.  Possible love interest.


Chief Engineer Civilian Human Doctor.  Male.  ""Drafted"" by Starfleet to make the Hiawatha space worthy again.  Was a teacher at Starfleet Academy (teaching Warp Drive Theory and Subspace Mechanics).  Will be convinced to sign on as permanent Chief Engineer despite not being in Starfleet.  Considers himself to be mainly a ""Theorist"".  Wants to return to Earth to resume teaching and publishing papers.  Possibly German?


Holographic Ship's Counselor.  Biological Counselors are in extremely HIGH demand since the devastating series of wars.  As such, Starfleet Medical has authorized the creation of Holographic Counselors as a stopgap measure.  Counselling sessions will initially be held on the holodeck until holoemitters can be installed throughout the ship.  Afterwards, the Counselor will be able to advise the Captain on the main bridge.  The Captain will need to utilize the Counselor's services as he is emotionally damaged.  The Counselor will submit a request for a name as he feels it will make him more approachable.  The irony of seeking help on being human from a computer program will not be lost of the Captain.


Helmsman Ensign Edison.  Male.  Was a cadet until recently when he was unexpectedly graduated from the Academy to take this post.  The Captain will have a hard time remembering his name (""Ensign...   'E'....  something.  Eckhardt?  Eisenhower?"") showing that Drago is having a hard time letting go of the bad habit he had of not remembering people's names.  In war there is no sense in learning the name of someone who will probably die and need to be replaced after all....


Story Ideas:

Pilot:  After leaving the Qualor II depot, Civilian Chief Engineer wants a warp speed test of the ship's structural integrity looking for microfractures of the hull.  The Hiawatha reaches a high warp velocity when two things happen: a microfracture of one of the warp pylons is detected AND an artificial object is detected on the hull hidden near a plasma baffle of the impluse engine.  The object is a gravitic mine of Romulan origin.  The Hiawatha's last mission prior to decommissioning was patrolling the Romulan Neutral Zone.  A stealth mine attached itself to the hull and went dormant.  The mine became active and powered up when the ship reached a high warp speed for the microfracture test.  (The Qualor II Depot was not far from the Neutral Zone, so the Hiawatha didn't reach a high warp speed on it's way there from the Neutral Zone.)  The mine will need to be defused manually by crewmembers going EVA while the ship is a warp as deceleration will most likely set the mine off.  The existing microfracture of the warp pylon will give a time pressure element to get the mine defused as it will get worse the longer the ship remains at high warp.  The mine's power signature will be discovered by the Cardassian Science Officer causing conflict with the Chief Engineer.  The Science Officer will stress the need to maintain warp speed while the Chief Engineer wants to shut the warp engines off ASAP.


Further stories:

Many aspects of the ship's older construction will plague the crew.  Drago will experience the door to his quarters only partially open causing him to slam into it at random times.  A ""rattling"" in the air conduits of Drago's cabin will keep him awake at night.  The Captain will start to have bad dreams related to the ship.  Ghostly images of a Native American warrior will start to appear.  Is it connected to the painting of a Native American that the previous Captain had left in the Ready Room?  Maybe a hand crafted shawl of Native American design will be found hidden in the air conduit behind the rattling grate?",startrek,airmaildolphin,False,/r/startrek/comments/ic7tws/my_rough_outline_for_a_new_star_trek_series_of/

Arnold returned to the big screen as Terminator in his old age.

Harrison Ford is slated to appear yet again as Indiana Jones at age 78. 

Star Wars brought back the principle cast of the originals to be in the new movies.  

And of course Star Trek Picard is bringing back Patrick Stewart at age 80. I think we're pushing our luck a bit with Stewart. He could go at any time. Look at the Star Wars example. We lost Carrie Fisher between movies and she was younger than Stewart.

Now watching the old shows like TOS or VOY, makes sense. They're good, its a good way to remember the past.

During season one, several Bajorans address their hatred for the Cardassians due to the occupation. In the climax of season one and beginning of season two, religious fanatics want to drive all non-bajorans from the system. Although being administered by the federation, it is still under Bajorans control, often stated by Sisko.

31,"Long Time Star Trek Fan finally watches Voyager: Season one, episodes 1 &amp; 2",1597755174,"I meant to start this quite awhile ago but then I rewatched Enterprise all by myself with no writing. There was a lot less crying than in DS9 until the last three episodes, at which point there was a lot of crying. Enterprise was the first ST series I ever watched, and Trip reminds me of my father, so the last few episodes were just brutal. I didn’t want it to end. But it did for now and now we’re watching Voyager. If you want to talk Enterprise, send me a message!

Please forgive me because I didn’t get all the names. There are a LOT of “main” characters on this series, at least right now and it’s hard to work with.

1.1 Caretaker

That was a lot in one straight shot. On the plot line, this is one of those situations where I don’t think the captain had the right to make this decision for the crew. She could have risked the array getting into the wrong hands, which we really know nothing about, and tried to get them home (which they seemed to have the technical knowledge to do). I believe in naval discipline and I believe that’s what they signed up for but only to a point. On this show, however, we’re not on the ocean a few miles off shore in constant contact with our superiors. We’re out in space. In this case, we’re WAY out in space (although honestly, to someone who doesn’t keep great track of this stuff, 70,000 lightyears doesn’t seem all that far. Anyone want to explain how lightyears work? I mean I get that is the distance light travels in a year but warp is faster than light. How much faster?). So honestly I’m trying to ignore all that and say we’re stuck out in space 75 years from home and THAT’S our starting point. And I loved the story of the alien that made such a horrible mistake that he’s spending his whole life making up for it. We see so many remorseless aliens on ST so I love seeing an alien with that degree of compassion and care. I’m also a little confused about the medical situation going on with Kim and Klingon girl. I feel like the resolution to that part of the plot was kinda glosses over

I am very excited about the show. How they got to the premise was shaky, but the premise itself is exciting. 

Anyone who read my DS9 watch through already knows I don’t like the Maquis. That said, I also dislike how Star Fleet handled the Maquis. I do like how Janeway smashed the crews together. She could have honestly arrested them. I would have been angry, but that was her choice to make. 

On characters
Janeway is not my favourite captain so far. But she’s not my least favourite either. She’s just not terribly exciting. What I find interesting about her though, is that she seems to be a combination of older Star Trek and modern Star Trek. There’s something very vintage about her. 

I liked Kim and Paris, although at least at first, Kim seemed very mechanical to me. He came into his own as he went. He was better in actual high stress situations than at Quark’s bar. 

I think Vulcan dude should have been first officer. I don’t have anything against Chacotay, I just have a certain fondness for Vulcan first officers. I do find it odd/interesting that Vulcan dude is a tactical officer. 

The hologram doctor is exciting to me but I also think he’s a bit of an ass. I hope he doesn’t end up being like the real doctor he’s modeled after because he was REALLY an ass.

Neelix is kind of annoying and the girl with him just doesn’t have a ton of interest yet. Her species is telepathic though, so that could be cool?

Parallax: this was a super cool episode. I loved the metaphor of sitting at the bottom of a frozen lake looking up. Half Klingon girl is a little too punchy to me. I always picture the engineers as level headed and focused. She screams a more “brute force” tactic for me. 

Some of Paris’s intrigue has been lost to me. He’s way too cooperative for somebody who got recruited out of prison. He could be a good middle man for Star Fleet vs. Maquis conflicts. I love his internal conflict between his father’s Star Fleet values and his own personal morals. Janeway seems to believe that he believes in them more than he is admitting.

58,Highlights on Sharing TNG with Mom - #3 The Best for Both Generations,1597710190,"Hi everyone. I'm in my late 40's. I first watched TOS Star Trek with my mom, local 3pm reruns back in the late 70's and early 80's. She's in her 70's now and recently, after a medical emergency, as I was nursing my mom back to health, I shared with her The Next Generation, for the first time. She'd never seen it. Here's how it went for season 3.

[If you want to know how Season 1 went, that can be found here.](https://old.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/hvz2f6/highlights_on_sharing_tng_with_mom_1_encounter/)

[And the update for how Season 2 is available here.](https://old.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/hwq3z5/highlights_on_sharing_tng_with_mom_2/)

As many of us already know, it has been long-touted that Season 3 is when TNG ""hit its stride."" This is unquestionably true. But what is also true is that Season 3 of TNG is probably the best, purest season of all the Berman Era Star Treks. It is the season where TNG finally gained such momentum that it could finally break the Star Trek ""three season ceiling"" of the original show.

Season 3 TNG was packed with good, quality, high-concept, self-encapsulated episodes. It also does some of the first, early work in gingerly reaching back and basing episodes on previous events in TNG continuity. You have to remember, in TOS, almost nothing got a follow-up. Episodes with actual sequels to TOS storylines only appeared in The Animated Series.

And so this season of TNG really did represent the Best of Both Worlds from the episodic storylines that TOS (and all non-soap older TV) relied upon, to the semi-serial format we saw come about in the Original Era movies and eventually TNG in its later seasons (a bit to the series' detriment, really), and then finally be perfected in the run of DS9. This slow transition to a more serial approach had its hits and its misses with my mom, and not always the same ones that hit for me.

It was probably the summer of 2019 while we watched season 3 as my mom continued to heal from her bout with cancer and her dehiscence. She was moving about a bit more and alert a bit more. And as we watched these episodes when they would sometimes call back to a plot point from a previous season, we found that the further they went back the less they worked for her. It seems that even as she seemed alert and engaged watching a lot of season one, just the healing and tiredness and state of mind she was in just meant a lot of Season One episodes were forgotten.

In fact, during Yesterday's Enterprise as I was explaining who Tasha Yar was I asked her if she remembered her dying and the funeral that affected her (and me) before and it seems much of Season One is remembered... but like a disjointed fever dream. Thinking back on it, that actually really fits a lot of the work of that season.

But things are clear for this, the best season of TNG. The opener itself, Evolution, which I found kind of a snoozer for a season opener back in the day, had her transfixed. I've spoken before about how high-school-me was probably closest to Wesley as a character, while my beautiful redhead mom was reminiscent of the Doctor. Well, in Evolution we had the story of the returning Dr. Crusher, feeling distant from a son who has taken to overworking as a way of dealing with his feelings. And we have an analog to Wesley in Dr. Stubbs who himself had shown useful brilliance and now felt so much pressure to cap off his fading scientific career. And Wesley, pressuring himself into making a mistake, putting it all in danger. I think she saw a lot of me, in this story.

So many solid stand-along adventure hours this season, too. Booby Trap; The Enemy, which helped bring the Romulans into focus; Allegiance, a great Jean-Luc solo adventure (rare!), and Captain's Holiday also; The Ensigns of Command, also a rare solo adventure for Data with a guest cast to play against, like The Most Toys later in the season. The Survivors became a more fascinating story through my mom's older eyes, with the sympathy she had for the old wife who turned out to be made solely of love and regret. In The Bonding she responded so much more to the tale of this young boy bonding to Data to avoid his trauma than I had when I first saw it, whereas I had sort of ensured the episode in my youth as a ""kid"" episode, and found new appreciation for moments I'd missed watching it with her.

Again, my mom would never fail to notice that a prominent guest star on the show had been on a soap. Soap workers hit marks, memorize their lines, make calls, all on a time schedule that would make regular weekly (and now, streaming) TV actors run screaming to their dressing rooms. The Vengeance Factor... she recognized Yuta (Lisa Wilcox) from what was apparently a short stint on Knot's Landing (a prime time soap of the era). The Hunted... she recognized Roga Danar (Jeff McCarthy) from a long ago stint on In The Heat of the Night. The Offspring... she recognized Admiral Haftel from three different soap operas! Dallas, Another World, and One Life to Live! Nothing wrong with mom's memory! Transfiguration, being a Dr. Crusher episode that was kind of a snoozer for me, instead fascinated her, and she recognized John Doe (Mark LaMura) from an apparently storied career on All My Children, One Life to Live, and As The World Turns.

Other stars I were sure from soaps but I was wrong. She didn't recognize Devonini Ral from The Prize and it turned out I did... as replacement Steve Guttenberg in the later Police Academy movies!

I mentioned that Yesterdays' Enterprise didn't land with her the way I expected. It wasn't just forgetting Tasha: the timelines, the battle scenes, the high sci-fi concepts... they didn't land as hard for her. It's becoming clear these are more my bag than hers, as we watch. That episode was followed by The Offspring, which is almost the spiritual follow-up to The Measure of a Man. This episode never hit as hard for me as it did watching it with my mom. Funny, that.

This was followed by Sins of the Father, which also landed much more strongly as my mom was so enthralled by Worf and his culture, what with her newfound understanding of Klingon as something more than an insult! K'Ehleyr's death and Worf's howl and words to Alexander, and his taking revenge on Duras, entranced her (I honestly did not remember the moment being as dramatic and powerful), and for the remainder of the series she would be very focused on Alexander and concerned about him. This eventually led to me giving a lot more of a chance to Alexander episodes that I had blown off quite thoroughly throughout my twenties and thirties, and most of my forties, really! They were all better than I gave them credit for, really.

I'm a bit concerned about how this will play out for Word through DS9, if we get around to it. I have a distinct memory of Worf as a father trying to get out of the job by shifting the kid off to someone, anyone else. But this TNG watch-through has proven me wrong. Worf raised Alexander, pretty well, at least on board the Enterprise. Sure, he had a lot of help from Deanna, but maybe I judged Worf too harshly for his job as a father. Still, I'm pretty sure he shipped him off to boarding school by the time he turned up on DS9...  😬

Sarek was a big episode for us. It was the first time since the pilot the show had directly featured a character from TOS, and the McCoy cameo in Encounter at Farpoint is probably entirely forgetten in fever dream, so this marked the real ""return"" of someone from The Original Series. And what a story, to watch again with fresh eyes with your aging mom as you struggle to help her heal from a life-threatening illness. You cannot understate Mark Lenard's fantastic work through all of Star Trek, and especially here, but this episode marked the moment for me, as I'm sure it did for many, when we truly understood the scope of Patrick Stewart's acting talent. This was a sad episode, sadder for me at this watch-through than ever before. Upon beaming away, it was stated, and my mom was hopeful, that there was always hope for a cure for Bendii Syndrome. Of course, I knew there would not be. But I was still in good spirits that what my mom had was cured, and she would, unlike Sarek, recover.

Finally we were ready for the season ender. Again I could not help but telegraph to her that it was a good one, which was fine. Growing ever more alert, sometimes she would finish an episode and agree with me it was a good one and sometimes she would disagree. The Defector, for example, was one of my favorites but the game of cat-and-mouse political intrigue fell flat for her. For the Best of Both Worlds, however, there was no disagreement.

Sometimes I'm amazed at how prescient, and how accidental, the development of the Borg was, since what I think was almost-accidentally created was one the best villain concept of Our Time. A species that was originally conceived by the writer as insectoid, just to covey the relentless alien hive mentality of them, was instead transformed by practical makeup necessity into something that worked for the production: cyborgized, networked bipeds that could be made good-looking and believable by the makeup department. But by casually moving the hive mind from an insectoid one to a technologically networked one, the TNG producers invoked current Mob Mentality, worries about The Singularity, and the relentless disinformation of Social Media all within the same forward-looking villain, back in 1989.

Nothing in Star Trek, before or since, is scarier than the Borg coming after you. And, even though in the time since there has been much debate about Locutus, the Borg Queen, and all the various methods and episodes to soften and place friendlier handholds on the Borg concept since their introduction, none of that had happened yet. And so, to have the Borg not only coming after you but naming you, Captan Picard, by name and coming after you as an individual...? Well, it was, at the time, a new kind of Borg terror.

See, when this aired originally for me, and for my mom as she was watching it with me, we didn't know the Borg took anything but your technology and your body. Nothing had yet suggested you could be assimilated individually, in a way that interfaced with your already-developed brain and made you a Borg. In Q Who we saw baby Borg in maturation chambers, and Riker commenting how the Borg interfaced directly with their brains, but we didn't know Borg themselves were formed also out of captured individuals. And that's the whole key to the cliffhanger, and why it worked so well. It played on all the mystery of this new enemy, and on depths of terrible ability they presented with which we were not yet familiar.

Back when we originally watched Best of Both Worlds when it aired, TNG hadn't even ever done a two-parter before, much less a cliffhanger. Encounter at Farpoint aired as a two-hour movie first-run. TV Guide made it clear that Cinema 2 was going to be on at 7, so as the episode built to its climax and the situation just seemed worse and worse, I can remember wondering how the show was going to wrap up this huge Federation-threatening conflict in, like five minutes. When the ""To Be Continued"" hit us we were shocked, brought right to the edge and left there... FOR AN ENTIRE SUMMER! It was AGONY!

My mom was spared this horrible wait. She insisted. Part 2. Right now. She had watched all of Part 1 in complete attention, and the very real (it seemed) prospect of losing Captain Picard, of having already lost him, really, had to be resolved. It did for me too, back in the day. The only difference being she had a choice!

But, really, I didn't envy her. No cliffhanger in the future would ever capture the magic, for me, of that summer... wondering aloud with my friends if Riker wold be captain, if the deflector dish plan would even work, etc. Not even Avengers: Infinity War. My mom probably hadn't seen the likes of this since ""Who shot J.R.?"" To really illustrate the brilliance of the slow reveal of the Borg, the whole resolution of this cliffhanger is what reveals they get inside your head when the deflector dish plan fails. For the whole summer leading up to Part 2, the question of whether or not that would happen was me and my buddy's ""smart insider"" track on what would happen.

Mom didn't have or want time to consider these theories. But she had the same ""how is this going to resolve?"" concerns as the episode neared its end. Then, it was on to Season 4. Either way you do it, it's perhaps appropriate to end any summary of Season 3 with compelling abruptness:

So, whenever Miles hears Keiko talk, he hears perfect English, and whenever Keiko hears Miles talk, she hears perfect Japanese.    


So then, what language does Molly pick up?  Kids learn languages by ""absorbing"" them from their parents, right?  They hear what their parents are saying and start mimicking it and learning the rules of the language organically.  So you'd think that Molly is hearing two people speaking completely two different languages to eachother as if they're the same language.  We hear Molly speak several times: what language is she actually using?  How are others, like her parents and Sisko (English) Worf (Klingon, Russian?) Dax (Trill) Bashir (English? Arabic?) and whoever else able to understand what she's saying?  How is the universal translator able to recognize whatever combination of Japanese and English words, with whatever hybrid form of grammar Molly uses, to be so accurately understood by everyone else?  


Or, maybe she has always had a universal translator, and always just heard and therefore learned whatever language was programmed into it.  First, what language is that?  Who decides?  Second, how are languages passed down?  Like, you'd think that plenty of languages would just not be chosen to be ""learned"" by children, so pretty much everyone on Earth would basically speak whatever language has been programmed into children over 300 years the most.

83,"Introduced my young son to one of my childhood favorite movies, ""The Rocketeer,"" and noticed a couple fun Star Trek connections",1597676294,"I cannot even begin to estimate how many times I watched ""The Rocketeer"" on VHS as a kid, other than the fact that I wore out *two* copies of the tape. It was probably my most-watched childhood movie, and had a big influence on the rest of my life (ongoing love of Art Deco, never-ending crush on Jennifer Connelly, etc.). I hadn't watched ""The Rocketeer"" in years though, so when my son asked if we could watching something fun this weekend, I had a moment of inspiration and found it on our Disney+ subscription. While we watched it, I noticed a couple cool cross-links between this awesome movie and Star Trek:

1. I definitely didn't know this as a kid, but the composer of the outstanding soundtrack for ""The Rocketeer"" was none other than James Horner, composer of many wonderful films, not the least of which were ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan"" and ""Star Trek III: The Search for Spock."" This isn't the biggest coincidence, he was a prolific composer of film music before his untimely death a few years ago. However, I noticed something on this viewing of ""The Rocketeer"" that I didn't (consciously) pick up on as a kid: there are some musical cues in Rocketeer which feel *very* reminiscent of segments from TWOK! Here's a quick example: Compare ~30 seconds of music from [this specific section of TWOK's soundtrack](https://youtu.be/DOFHi7SRMoU?t=744) to the music from the sequence of Rocketeer where Jenny Blake [uncovers a terrible secret](https://youtu.be/Yd-ZwDF0N98?list=PLH9C08qrQ7S7MbCinav_YWZcxdnUvDiqD&amp;t=330) in the home of matinee idol Neville Sinclair. It's nothing overtly copied from one film to the next, but they feel ""compatible"" in a way I hadn't previously noticed.

2. The second thing I noticed this time around is that one of the mobsters (""Wilmer"") featured at the start of ""The Rocketeer"" was played by none other than Max Grodénchik, aka Rom from ""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine!"" I was a *huge* DS9 fan as a kid (still am!) and something about this particular character always seemed *weirdly familiar*... now I know! I'm halfway surprised that he didn't start calling out for Moogie when he was being killed by the imposing Lothar in Rocketeer. Even better, ""Lothar"" was played by Tiny Ron! Tiny Ron (RIP) was an iconic ""That Guy"" with numerous roles in Star Trek - [check him out here](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Tiny_Ron).

Anyway, I hope you guys enjoy this too - if you haven't seen ""The Rocketeer"" in a while (or ever?!), do yourself a favor and check it out - I don't think it's just childhood nostalgia talking when I assure you that it's aged wonderfully.",startrek,wowbobwow,False,/r/startrek/comments/ibfohd/introduced_my_young_son_to_one_of_my_childhood/

Given that he specifically asked if he ate flesh we can surmise those cured of the infection have no memory of what happened while they were 'zombies' but I thought his question was a bit odd even if it was for the sake of humor.

On the one side you could just say that he was able to taste the aftertaste in his mouth from the last person he bit, but that would then beg to ask how he knew what human flesh tasted like.

So, either Ransom has had something like this happen before, and knows what human (or humanoid) tastes like, as he had no memories of what happened, or he is a vegetarian by choice and his reaction was simply to the aftertaste of meat.

Either way it's an interesting idea to play with, as it means him becoming a zombie might be a recurring thing, or he's Starfleet's first vegetarian first officer that we know of.

And although the mirror universe had to steal cloaking tech, not create it, it was possible to travel in time using our own SUN. So I'm pretty sure time travel would've been atleast partially viable in the mirror universe by 31st Century.

Add to this that most species had a darker mindset (esp. seen in Beta Content), not just humans, A Temporal War would've been inevitable and would possibly be universally destructive (a dozen aliens almost turned earth into a Nazi state in the prime universe, so what do you think would happen in the alternate universe).

0,Legacy - What We Leave Behind,1597642867,"I'll preface this with the (grateful) fact that this isn't a related to a tragic story in my life. Rather, it's about the profound difference DS9 might have made in all of our lives. This also isn't intended to be a DS9 circlejerk post, just an honest reaction to the last twelve hours or so of contemplation. I also promise this isn't a post about race, though there is some component to it.

Earlier this morning I finished my breakfast  with a piece of toast and washed it down with tears as I sobbed watching the final moments of the DS9 finale. It's not my first, or second, or even third rewatch, but the emotions the show has managed to grab are still fresh and raw. Aside from DS9, the other show I had a visceral reaction to was Fresh Prince of Bel Air, so this isn't something that happens often for me. My last revisit was a couple of years ago, so circumstances in my life (and the world) were much different. 

I'm a young black man, 30, and living on my own, far from family, and though I don't feel a pervasive fear that seems to be moving through the US right now I do have many concerns. Yesterday, I had a long conversation with my dad, who is white, that was timely in relation to my finishing of the show. Really, this is the only part that race has to do with it: as we finished up he admitted that he worried for me and my siblings every day with the state of things going on, and that a room was always waiting for me at home. That really shook me, because not once since I've moved out has he made a statement like that so directly.

The last few years has not been kind to him, a man of 72, coincidentally about six weeks younger than Avery Brooks: his wife left him, his other son moved out in the midst of a fight, his daughter will be leaving soon for school, and me out far away. He's in the twilight of his life. But he's out here still worrying for us and about us. For all his faults, I can still say that he's been a good father. 

Which brings me to the point of the post and what really shook me to the core today and has had me distracted for hours. Watching seven seasons of Jake's growth and interaction with Captain Sisko, knowing that Brooks and Lofton had a very real father/son type relationship on set and in life, and seeing Jake stare out the window wondering if his very not-dead father would ever return to his life was heartbreaking.

It had me thinking of a quote I heard a few years ago regarding parents that is both morbid but carries truth: one of parents' responsiblities is to leave good memories for their children.

I would like to think that as one of the very *best* tv dads Sisko has created some very lasting memories for us. Maybe for some being an example where they had none (as Brooks always stressed that Sisko had to be a good father to Jake), or an additional point of wisdom. Certainly, as a young adult, he's had a marked impression on me, especially in recent years, as has every character on the show, and I very much appreciate the small part of my life that Brooks and the rest of the show have influenced. And i really hope that folks on this sub have had the same experience as surrogate children of Trek. 

I know that Brooks has been withdrawn from Hollywood life for a long time but I know that a lot of the DS9 cast and crew has some activity on social media, as do other Trek people, but if this ever finds its way to his eyes: Thank you, from the bottom of my heart. 

I wasn't sure at all about writing my thoughts down, and debated even doing it because ""what's the point?"", but it has helped to focus some of these profound feelings of eventual loss that have been on my mind for a while.

13,Episode discussion: TNG / Chain of Command (6 x 10; 6 x 11),1597632193,"\[Putting up a spoiler tag for fledgelings like myself who are still gingerly exploring the Trek universe\]

I just got off Chain of Command Parts 1 &amp; 2 which I thought were simultaneously brilliant yet irksome. My full thoughts in this post. Feel free to chime in with yours! Quick request though: TNG is my first ST series, so I don't as yet have more in-universe context beyond that. Therefore, appreciate if one could cloak spoilers beyond TNG thank you! 

&amp;#x200B;

**Series of tactical errors**

I struggled with the fact that Picard was so easily dispatched on a ground mission in hostile territory. The plot was supposed to have sufficiently motivated it (being the only Starfleet officer on active duty with extensive knowledge in theta-band waves), but I still can't shake the feeling that there must've been a 'better way' to get Picard captured.

1. Replacing command of the Enterprise literally the week before Cardassian negotiations was such a ridiculously transparent move on the part of Starfleet. How did anyone think they could have gotten away with that??
2. Sending a Starfleet Captain into a black ops mission with almost no other central intelligence - did nobody think to despatch an initial team to first confirm the intelligence?? 
3. If there was anyone who could negotiate with the Cardassians, it would've been Picard. And Jellico should have been kept far, far away from ANY diplomacy! The guy's a cowboy! Why would he want to present himself as the bad cop when the aim of a good negotiator is always for win-win? (Tell me if I'm ranting too much about this because 90s TV? Lol)

&amp;#x200B;

**Leadership**

It's pretty obvious that Jellico was set up to be antithetical to Picard so ~~necessary~~ enough tension can be created in anticipation of Picard's mission, but I have to wonder whether such leaders would have had a place in Starfleet. I get that regiment has a place in hierarchy and technical order, but Picard is an extremely consultative leader, which is why he is beloved. Jellico on the other hand, was just *Trump*\-ian. In a time-sensitive mission like COC Part 1, would his leadership style have been successful with the senior officers in real life (taking into account the need for swift, accurate decision-making and clockwork operations)? 

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion**

As always, I thought it was too neatly wrapped (albeit Picard's private admission at the end but we'll get to that). I thought it was terrible that Riker didn't go on a black ops rescue mission of his own, especially after he was relieved of duty. It seemed just like something Riker would do. But nooo instead he decided to lounge around in that ridiculous blue lingerie (lol sorry Riker fans I could never stand his lounge wear!). Alas, twas still the era of plot-driven TV. 

I know they wrote in Picard's private admission to show just how far he had already been pushed, but I'm a stickler for ""show not tell"" storytelling. I think they should have added at least one more scene before the final one with Madred, showing Picard literally at the end of his rope. Instead, just before, Picard was shown triumphing at the breakfast, so it was hard to believe he would have been breaking by the final scene (ergo why they probably had to add the admission scene). 90s TV ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

&amp;#x200B;

**Favourite moment**

I thought Part 2 with the philosophical tennis matches between Madred and Picard was sublime! Picard's torture was believable, and the attempts to break him were spiritually moving. A well-used 1984 reference, though I thought the military state theme could have been written in stronger to complement the reference.

&amp;#x200B;

**Overall**

I thought COC 2 was a very solid episode, with COC 1 only there to serve the bigger story. What did anyone else think?

1. Could there have been a better ploy to capture Picard not involving Starfleet tactical errors?
2. Would you have changed the ending? How?

50,Star Trek TOS is how Sisko imagines the adventures of Captain Kirk,1597590716,"**Introduction**

This hinges on the fact that DS9's ""Trials and Tribble-ations"" is Sisko relaying the events of the episode to Lucsly and Dulmer and that Benny Russell is a very real part of Sisko's subconscious, maybe a distant ancestor who was also conceived by one of the Prophets or even an incarnation of Sisko/The Emissary himself. In short, Sisko imagines Kirk and Co's (as well as Pike) early missions as a 1950's/1960's science fiction writer would. (more about this later)

If we accept that what we see is DIS is how the Enterprise (pre-refit) is supposed to appear, that Pike we see in DIS, the Talosians, Planet Vulcan, Klingons and Uniforms, etc, etc are always how they have always appeared, then there's quite a contradiction with what we then see on TOS.

Before I continue, I realize that there are some readily apprent flaws to this, such as what Scotty orders up in Relics, along with what we see in ENT's ""In a Mirror, Darkly"", but then what we see in Relics could be a poor approximation, whilst In a Mirror, Darkly could also be accepted as something Sisko imagined, from his experiences in the Mirror Universe.

**Historical Idol Syndrome &amp; Non-Linearity**

With that in mind, I propose that TOS works if we accept that this is how somebody from the future would envision the adventures of somebody in history that they idolized.  We know that Sisko idolized James T. Kirk, and we also know that Sisko experienced a reality where he was a 1950's Science Fiction writer called Benny Russell. We also know that whilst in that reality, he imagined the people around him to be physically similar to people he knew in his reality as Benjamin Sisko. This IMO, connects Benny and Sisko as two beings of perhaps the same prophet, rather than creating a dilemma of what is real and what isn't. If we bring in the concept that the Prophet's are non-linear beings, and that Sisko was conceived by the Prophets, then he has always been Benny Russell as well as being Benjamin Sisko. Each individual shares the same personality traits, with the divide being their life experiences and the eras in which they exist linearly.

But the most important take away from this is that Sisko has the imaginative qualities of a 1960s Science Fiction writer (which could also explain Jake's aptitude for writing), because of his link to Benny Russell.

**Sisko's Imagination**

Sisko imagines Kirk's adventures as a campy 1960's science fiction pulp. He idolizes Kirk and casts him as a dashing, flawless, cerebral man with impressive physical prowess who is very much the constant hero. He hams up Kirk's reputation as a ladies man, imagining him to become immediately involved with women he encounters, irrespective of whether it actually happened or didn't. He imagines Kirk to have performed impossible miraculous feats based on history's dictation of Kirk having used bluffs and gambits to avoid confrontation. This takes the form of Kirk talking computers and artificial lifeforms into self-destructing, to convincing enemies (on his word alone) that he had a fictitious  Corbomite Reflector. We see Kirk besting people in hand to hand combat with barely a scratch on him, ad nauseam.

**The Reality**

The reality of Kirk and Co's five year mission is much closer to what we see in the movies. Their hostile encounters they had were costly, involved significant loss of personnel and were solved by a collaborative effort of the crew's ingenuity, expertise and experience and not by something Kirk conceives of on his own footing. Being vaporized by a phaser is every bit the brief, but excruciatingly painful experience we see in TWOK, and not the quick non-reactive disappearing act we see throughout TOS. Brutal Transporter accidents sometimes happen and Starfleet officers are often severely injured or maimed in any hand to hand engagements they are involved in. It's not simply karate chops or jumping kicks. Events such as ""The Doomsday Machine"" and ""Balance of Terror"" killed many dozens of crew-members, and the skirmishes with the Klingons were heavily waterered down because it's a painful subconscious reminder that Benny Russell was a victim of racial abuse.

See Kirk and Co are extremely prejudiced of Klingons, bordering on racism due to the wars they fought against them, the crew members killed in cold blood, the death of David Marcus, etc. The Klingons in TOS don't look like Klingons, because that is how Sisko removes the racial prejudice expressed by his heroes, because he is *still* influenced by that part of him that's Benny Russell - the writer who envisions a science fiction world that's free from the racism that he is surrounded by.

Kirk was further, much more flawed than Sisko perceives him. He was an absent father, unable to commit to having a family opting to put his duties first, unlike his officers (Sulu for example, but also Sisko himself) who were able to balance aspects of being a father, a husband, etc whilst also being a Starfleet Captain.

He imagines the TOS Klingons as without the features that make them different to humans (because he is a human himself), perhaps imagining that a disease he read about that diluted the features of Klingons in the 22nd century, applied to all the Klingons that Kirk encountered. Furthermore, he waters down their atrocities and Klingon personalities, putting them more of a level-footing cunningness, consistent with how he imagines his his hero - Kirk and perhaps also Worf, who is humanised by his Earth upbringing. This further serves to ignore the likely atrocities that Starfleet committed during wartime against the Klingons too (which we see some of in TUC).

He envisions some of Kirk's adventures as far more elaborate than they were. Certainly there's a possibility that much of Kirk's five year mission was classified due to some of the things they encountered and the actions they took, thus Sisko pieces some of it together from rumors, theories and broad historical records. 

**Why, Sisko?**

This is Sisko's coping strategy for the horrible things he has experienced and had to do as both a Starfleet Officer and a War Commander. He imagines a happier time for his heroes, and continues this perception despite travelling back in time to Kirk's ship (although they did use a Bajoran Orb to pull this off and Sisko is the Emissary, this could have easily been an illusion of sorts and played out differently for each of the DS9 officers who were experiencing it - including the Klingons different ""look"" being a cosmetic thing such as being bald, tattooed or even wearing helmets).

Sisko envisions a time in the past where he believes things were better, where there was no Borg, Dominion or Cardassians, this helps him keep his faith in Starfleet and the philsophy of the Federation and the utopias it has created, despite there being a gradual decline towards dystopia with each passing year. It's a crutch, to stop him succumbing to his own dark side, such as when he manipulates the Romulans into the war. His imagination is one that perceives the past much like a Science Fiction writer from the early 20th century would perceive the future, because of his link to Benny Russel.

54,Why doesn’t StarFleet install plot armor on all of its ships?,1597582405,"So on many occasions, we‘ em seen the Enterprise, Defiant, Voyager, and Discovery be able to take an absolute pounding and still come out alive. I’m assuming this is because at the Utopia Planitia Shipyards, StarFleet installs plot armor as part of the defensive capabilities on these ships.

Meanwhile some *Miranda-class* or *Excelsior-class* will take a single torpedo hit or phaser blast and explode in half.

So why does StarFleet only install plot armor on a few ships? It’s clearly very powerful, so strategically, wouldn’t it make sense to install this defensive capability on all of your ships, not just a small few?

55,“One Of Our Planets Is Missing” - First Time Viewing Reaction,1597578148,"Note: I got the heeby-jeebies when a number of people commented that Yesteryear is easily the best TAS episode. I don't want to think it’s all downhill from here this early on. Hopefully I’ll buck the trend and find other episodes I enjoy as well.

Noob Trek 82 - One Of Our Planets Is Missing

I have to love the way the title just declares the premise. I wish other episodes had followed this naming convention. The City On The Edge Of Tomorrow could have been A Lady Kirk Doesn‘t Want To Die Dies and Amok Time would have been titled Spock Goes Mad With Breeding Fever.

(Note: I had no idea about this, but my dad tells me the title is a joke which has fallen victim to the passing of time. He says there was a 1942 war drama called One Of Our Aircraft Is Missing which was a huge hit and is considered among the best films of its period, though I‘ve not seen it.)

I just hoped “One Of Our Episodes Sucks” wasn’t going to prove to be a more apt title here. Fortunately it didn’t. I liked this a lot. It was a bit of a mash of The Immunity Syndrome (in fact I wonder if our cloud being here is the same species) with The Devil In The Dark but it was strong anyway. The compact format of the show meant things kept moving at a a nice pace, and the episode managed to be unusually intelligent for Saturday morning kids fare.

I quite liked the opening scenes of the episode, it doesn’t waste any time in putting the Enterprise against a mighty foe, a vast planet dissolving gas cloud. I’m instantly intrigued by the scale of the threat, curious about its nature, and eager to see how the crew will manage. I hope it doesn’t turn out that Galactus farted.

They give Arex a name, confirming that he is a new character and not Chekov after some sort of hair replacement therapy mishap. Speaking of crew members, it’s ironic that this 24 minute cartoon makes better use of the ensemble cast than pretty much the entirety of TOS. Sulu, Arex, Uhura and McCoy all makes meaningful contributions to discussions and actions on the bridge, while Scott and McCoy each star in their own little mini-adventures, Scott to save the Enterprise and Spock to save the planet. Kirk acts as the glue to hold all the interactions and scenes together. The density of the episode means it rolls along without a lot of time for character - the crew seem extraordinarily calm given their situation - but they still squeeze in emotional notes with the scenes of Governor Wesley struggling with the decision he must make.

Speaking of the quality dialogue throughout the story, I like the realistic discussion about whether they should inform the planet of their impending doom. I’m a little confused about how you have to leave Starfleet to govern a planet though. Aren’t the planets under Starfleet’s jurisdiction anyway?

The way Kirk just ploughs the ship thoughtlessly into the cloud is not quite so convincing but it makes sense when you have 20 minutes and need to make things happen. Inside the ship, the Enterprise is immediately attacked by killer popcorn. Seriously though, quite a lot of thought has been put into the cloud creature and again, it really projects an air of quality and intelligence that makes me forgive them rather static animation. In very short time, we are introduced to a number of systems inside the creature that make some sense of its nature and workings.

There’s even a debate about killing the creature, unusual for a children’s show of the time I would imagine. Something really interesting happens that shows us how ideal Starfleet is though. Normally in this setup, it’s the stickler following the rules who wants to do the bad thing (kill the creature) while our hero thinks with his heart and disobeys orders and protects it. Here the exact opposite happens. Human Kirk and McCoy feel the creature can’t be stopped, so opt to kill it. But it’s stickler Spock who notes that in line with Starfleet directives, they are not permitted to kill it without learning if it is intelligent. There follows a cool scene where Spock actually mind melds and switches consciousnesses with this immense being, educating it that it is destroying civilisations and cultures. The ticking clock is corny but the episode is fun and smart enough that I forgive it,

I’m a bit disappointed that the cloud leaves (I would have tried swearing it into Starfleet, imagine that being your first officer) and I wonder if we ever learn more about this beings, like their breeding and life cycle and home planet and so on.

So yeah, you know what, as good as Yesteryear was I think I like this even more. Very efficient, good dialogue, well put together, seems to respect its audience, good mix of thrills and thoughtful themes. If TAS can stay this good, it’s going to end up one of the better 70s cartoon shows I’ve seen.",startrek,Kayfim20,False,/r/startrek/comments/iaqy43/one_of_our_planets_is_missing_first_time_viewing/

60,Do you think she could be alive?,1597571426,"So I finished watching Picard and I can't help but wonder if Narissa is alive. I know she fell into that chasm but i feel like she's going to become a borg queen. I mean they went messing around with a Borg cube and I'm new to Star Trek (got into it a few years ago only started getting back in) but I kept getting the vibe that they were and still are going into regret using that thing. We know Seven took control temporarily as a queen and my theory is when she did she woke something up.

I think it will start repairing itself and we'll see a dying Narissa being assimiliated into the artifact. It might do this because she's the only body available or because she was trying to use it but I do think that artifact is going to become fully functional. It was just such a strong focus that I highly doubt the artifact is truly out of play.

I mean through out the whole season I was expecting shit to hit the fan with it and I still can't believe they just left it there on the planet. I mean I'm not very knowledgeable on Star Trek lore but I know a sleeping bear when I see one and they just kept on poking it throughout all of season one and I honestly think we'll see it wake up in Season 2.

Besides I think her coming back as a borg queen would be a good way to bring her brother back into the story I can see Picard gathering the team together and Narek showing up wanting to save his sister and asking to join. I can just picture Soji hating him and for Picard to surprise by saying he invited Narek to join because Narek has knowledge of the Cube and has a interest in helping them stop the borg.",startrek,EmperorJoker,False,/r/startrek/comments/iapqd7/do_you_think_she_could_be_alive/

74,Conundrum- a revisit,1597547891,"I've been rewatching ENT, but my husband only has the patience for TNG, so tonight we switched over and I picked an episode he hasn't seen yet. A few observations:

1. I love the opportunity this script gave the actors---allowing them to play on different roles. Worf assuming command because it's in his blood to man a ship for battle. Seems pretty obvious, but it was nice to see him able to go on a tear for a bit before being shut down. The writers seem to tread on this throughout the series. Showing Worf as nature-born for unmitigated battle; then when the time comes, he is the one who doesn't pull the trigger. 

2. I love how we are all reassured of Picard's seeming perfection as a leader. He doesn't join in the arms race to assert oneself as the others do in this episode---either tactically or sexually (cf. Riker and Ro); he simply asks meaningful questions. He shows true leadership by putting the wellbeing of the ship first, emphasizing the importance of system diagnostics over getting her battle-ready. When Worf apologizes for presuming authority, Picard shows no ego.

3. Oh, Data, dear Data. I love how when Geordi oggles at your abilities (in rewriting a subroutine), you show that no matter what, you will always be curious about your place in the universe. No one else is considering where they came from or who else they call brother. But even a Data wiped of short-term memory knows he is unique and potentially alone in the universe. Bittersweet. 
(side note, I love how Data emerges from the memory-wiping as the bartender)

4. I love how clear Starfleet training shines through in this narrative. That they are supposed to kill a much less than formidable foe is ludicrous, not a moment to bask in easy victory. Clearly there is must sinister deception involved. ""I do not fire on defenseless people.""

It wasn't a show about stuffy old men talking about space. It was a show about morality. Politics of the 60s. It was incredible and I was transfixed.

No, really.

It's obviously not a good episode, in most all possible ways it's a bad one, but I still love it anyway.  **Here's my theory:**

Everything I heard about the episode was how bad it was, I've seen people stating that it was the worst episode in all trek series, and since I'm not a masochist, everytime I would watch the series I would skip it - after all, it was a bad episode sandwiched by some of the greatest in the series.

Until today.

My wife is a lax trekkie, she loved most of the movies, DS9 and Voyager, but could not get into the original series, TNG and Enterprise (don't even start with the new ones, I've been suffering Discovery alone), but I digress. Since we've been stuck in home for the best part of the year and saw everything we haven't seen before that was available, we decided to watch Star Trek again. TOS didn't impress her, but after the first season of TNG, she was hooked.

That lead us to yesterday Star Trek session. We watched Parallels, The Pegasus, Homeward and when I was about to jump Sub Rosa to watch Lower Decks, she says she wanted to watch it and since the season was so good so far there was no chance it would be that bad.

And so we watched it... **And it's amazing**.

Don't get me wrong, it's bad, but it's kitschy bad, it's entertaining bad, it's not dull and boring bad (like most of the first season).

It has an alien hunk ghost controlling a centenarian zombie in the middle of space Scotland while Gates Mcfadden devour the scenery.

It's not even the worst episode of the season - I'm looking at you Force of Nature.

My point is, when was the last time you actually watched the episode? What do you think is so bad about it? Let's discuss. It's cool to talk about the good moments, but I think it's even more interesting to understand why it's such a maligned episode.

0,Reasoning for my Lower Decks opinion,1597523884,"My other post about how I strongly dislike Lower Decks got taken down for lack of reasoning, so here are my reasons.
1: Loud does not equal funny:
This show seems to think that a joke constitutes being as loud as possible. It’s style of comedy is extremely repulsive. Even things that would be clever, such as the show being an inverse portrayal of normal Trek, are completely undermined by the fact that everyone is always yelling. It’s completely witless, and it becomes irritating very quickly. Regular Trek has better comedy than this show, and that’s not even the main focus with those shows.
2: The animation looks disgusting:
I’ve always hated the style of animation that the show is in. It looks extremely cheap and lazy. This is more of a personal problem though, so there’s no point in debating it.
3: The character’s don’t feel real:
The first couple episodes of the show is where a strong connection to the characters needs to be established. It’s especially important in comedy to have a lead that we can connect with, but all of the characters are one-dimensional farces. Even then, every attempt at character building feels incredibly forced and poorly written.
4: Wasted premise:
The one thing that I like about this show is it’s premise, and it’s executed extremely poorly. I would have greatly preferred a regular Trek show set in the lower decks to this garbage, even though CBS probably wouldn’t have done a very good job with it anyway. Like I said in the comedy section, every idea that could be clever is completely undermined by irritating “comedy” that consists of people shouting, and pointless references to things that we recognize.

I understand that this sounds rather hostile, but my anger is at the show and CBS, not the people who enjoy it. If you do like this show, there’s nothing wrong with that, and I’m genuinely interested to hear why.

4,"Tbh I like supposedly ""boring"" plots and themes like how to organize second contact missions",1597520696,"""Lower Decks"" caters to the idea of showing the dull, boring life on a Federation starship. Of course this is the central theme of the show, combined with its silliness and humor.

But honestly I really like the idea of having a Show taking this a bit more far and  treating it a bit more seriously. I really liked the idea of showing how a second contact actually works, how you need to follow certain federation protocolls  and so on. But it itches me a bit that the producers obviously think this is only possible in a comedy setting, without going to much in depth and without the philosophical implications that come with these stories. 

It doesn't always has to be the ""either we're saving the universe or we are all going to die"" stories we see so much in the new shows. How cool would it be to show the difficulties between, let's say, establishing relations with a new discovered alien race, learning about their culture, differences to federation values and so on. After all, this always has made a huge part of Trek. 
Not that I don't like ""Lower Decks"", I think it's a real breath of fresh air, but I hope they will include this kind of storylines in the other shows.

""The line must be drawn here."" Is remember as Picard's badass declaration against the Borg. But its really his Ahab moment. He immediately follows up with the very un-Picard-like ""And I will make them pay for what they've done.""

34,Thoughts about the theory regarding Star Trek canon and the 'alternate license'?,1597473778,"So I recently came across this series of videos about the Star Trek rights issues and how they affected the canon of the series from the 2009 reboot onwards. I'd always assumed that the rights issues were restricted to Paramount having the film rights and CBS having the TV rights, but apparently it was a lot more complicated than that.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K828aSkhRHk

This is the shorter video, but there's a longer version on the same channel.

The basic idea is that the Star Trek canon comprises of all the shows and movies up till and including Enterprise. After that, starting with the 2009 reboot, CBS provided an 'alternate license' to Paramount to allow them to make new Star Trek movies. But this 'alternate license' meant that they were legally obliged to create an alternate version of Star Trek that deviated from the 'canonical' Star Trek by at least 25%, in terms of visuals, tonality and plot. The reason for this was so that CBS could continue to profit off the merchandise sales from the 'canon' Star Trek, while Paramount could build the 'alternate' Star Trek and profit of the merchandise from that.

Later, when CBS commissioned Discovery, the Star Trek team from Paramount developed the show, and so it was developed under the same 'alternate license' as the Kelvin movies. Therefore Discovery, Picard and any subsequent shows are part of the same alternate continuity/canon as the Kelvin movies (albeit they're set in the 'Prime timeline' established by those movies). And this explains why they only need to loosely line up with the canon of the old shows and movies.

Now, fair warning - the maker of this video comes across as someone who's anti-Discovery and is probably using this to delegitimize the show by making it 'non-canonical'. But factually speaking, do you'll think there's some substance in this?

Frankly, I have no real problem with the notion that everything from TOS to Enterprise was part of an original canon, and everything since then is part of an alternate canon. Its all a matter of semantics at the end of the day, and the post-2009 movies and shows should be judged on their merits. And thinking of it as a soft reboot, legally mandated or otherwise, can help smooth over the inconsistencies, visually or otherwise. 

But this does make me wonder? The video is 18 months old and a lot has changed since then - most notably the Viacom CBS merger. So is there no longer a point to the 'alternate license'? But will that change the creative direction of the upcoming projects?

Fascinating to think about, especially for students of media.",startrek,sanddragon939,False,/r/startrek/comments/ia2qts/thoughts_about_the_theory_regarding_star_trek/
35,SPECULATION: A secret plot by CBS with Disco and SNW,1597472859,"DISCLAIMER: this isn't based on any information, official or leaked. This is Pure Speculation. Got it? Good.

I had this what if idea on the back of my mind since the news and rumors started to break for Strange New Worlds. Now unlike what others might think, the design changes introduced in Discovery in regards to the prequel nature of the show and its linked to TOS DOES NOT BOTHER ME AT ALL. I've been down this road with many other IPs from comics to anime and I was surprised if anyone had any issues like that. I'm like ""guys, its a redesign, a modernism, a refashion, a cosmetic change, a retcon, whatever! Its only different to us, but in universe, its the 'same'. That's how its done. Its meant to happen because its sci fi, brand new and futuristic and get easily outdated."" Surprisingly, because I've seen this before, I was surprised Star Trek didn't do this until now in regards to already covered canon. But its fandom, so it is sadly expected.

Then there was the idea of stories set in the past, especially with established characters: its a prequel, again. But they always brought up its place in canon, and while I didn't have a problem, I did notice it enough to question how'd they get out of that herald from a storytelling aspect. Obviously, from Disco it was Michael being Spock's adopted sister. While how they resolved it works, its still questionable in the long run. 

But now, and again a rumor, Strange New Worlds might have Kirk in it. And if so, from there I felt the little conspiracy theorist in me start to ignite with questions over what might be going on really behind these shows. Again, the redesigns aren't a problem, but then you got to remember that Abrams redesigned everything, but it worked because he did the one thing that got old and new fans rejoicing: alternate timeline. And that leads to the question of this topic:

Do you think CBS is secretly plotting with Discovery and Strange New Worlds, or are these two shows, a Star Trek reboot? Thus give it a few years, and what might come after SNW? A rebooted Trek series starting the new incarnations of the original cast. Maybe calling it Star Trek: To Boldly Go.

If anyone brings up the TOS Pilot still being used for Disco, my answer would be ""playing it safe"". 

Again, this is based on nothing. Nothing official, nothing leaked, N-O-T-H-I-N-G. This is all speculation.

Vulcans are more logical than us, more even tempered, 3x stronger, can go longer without rations AND (most importantly) live ~3x longer. That last one alone makes it a mathematical inevitability that every major position in Starfleet would, given enough time, be held by only Vulcans.

72,Let's do jokes! I'll go first.,1597431249,"...Let us suppose that the Enterprise is doing some sort of research mission to an unknown planet. I think the Captain's Log would be worth a look:

Captain's Log, Stardate 54324.5: Starfleet Command has directed the Enterprise to do a preliminary exploration of planet --- in advance of a full research team. Scanners report the atmosphere to be breathable, but are receiving confusing readings with regard to life forms. I am beaming down with a landing party composed of all our chief officers except for poor Scotty.

Supplement: Redshirt Riley has received a head injury, apparently while exploring under a high rock shelf. He reports only hearing a loud sound and jumping before being struck. After examination by Dr. McCoy he has been judged capable of continuing duty.

Supplement: We have encountered an alien creature on this planet. While it does not itself seem menacing, a unfortunate occurrence took place when it was present. Specifically, on my orders Lt. Sulu withdrew his phaser. The creature disappeared leaving a puff of smoke, immediately following which a loud noise was heard next to Sulu. Sulu fired, hitting Ens. Chekov. Oddly enough, although Sulu's weapon was set to stun, Chekov was also covered with a black powder similar to soot. Mr. Chekov has been sent back to the ship for examination and quarantine.

Stardate 54326.2, Mr. Spock reporting: Tricorder readings indicate that the creature we encountered earlier is constantly moving at great speed over the surface of the planet. We have encountered the creature once again. In an attempt to slow the creature for study, I attempted to fire on it. The creature, however, appeared to move faster than the phaser beam. Regretfully, the beam struck an outcropping of rock above the Captain's head, causing it to break off and fall. Although it appears that several tons of rock fell squarely on the Captain, he was driven straight into the ground but apparently not seriously injured, though stunned. The Captain has been beamed up to Sickbay, leaving me in command of the research party.
Captain's Log, Stardate 54342.1: The creature is still at large on the planet's surface. While Mr. Spock continues to lead a research party I am currently at work with Mr. Scott on an Acme Pressure Cooker for our lab, for when the creature is finally apprehended.

Captain's Log, stardate 54342.3. The strange occurences that have dogged the landing party since our arrival at this planet have led me to believe that the creature is in some way directly responsible for them. Mr. Chekov and I have both been declared fit for return to duty, though Dr. McCoy has entered in his medical log that he feels we should be kept under observation. Mr. Spock has constructed a device which he suspects should be able to counteract the creature's incredible speed as follows: We have placed a dish of birdseed out in the open, with several signs pointing to it. The dish is atop a cleverly concealed trap door, which will open when any weight falls on it. The creature will then travel a slide, eventually being deposited in a cage constructed of sheets of transparent aluminum. We will then be free to analyze it at our leisure. Meanwhile, I have forbidden all beaming down to the surface of the planet except on my or Mr. Spock's direct order.

Captain's Log, supplemental. The plan failed. The creature was indeed lured by the birdseed, as expected. It sped to the dish, consumed the bait, and sped off without setting off the trap. Mr. Spock is as puzzled as I, and has begun tests to discover the flaw in the design. I have sent out three search parties to see if we can box the creature in, one headed by Mr. Sulu, one by Mr. Chekov, and one by Sociologist Xontel.

Captain's Log, stardate 54342.8. Sociologist Xontel has been temporarily incapacitated. In pursuing the creature, he and his men somehow managed to cross the place where Mr. Spock's trap was set just as he completed the corrections to it. The trap was sprung, and all four of my men were suspended for a moment in mid-air, puzzled, just before they fell into the cage we constructed. We are now trying to release them with phasers, as the lock was inadvertently smashed by the impact from Sociologist Xontel's foot as he fell. I consider this a major setback. Mr. Spock considers it ""fascinating.""

Captain's Log, stardate 54343.4. In an all-out attempt to stop the creature once and for all, I have had a phaser rifle beamed down from the Enterprise. The creature has behaved in an extremely cunning manner, yet I am unsure whether this is a sign of actual intelligence. Lt. Uhura has been unsuccessful in her attempts to raise Starfleet Command. Meanwhile, Mr. Scott informs me that our dilithium crystals are deteriorating at an alarming rate. He has juryrigged a system that will prevent the decay for a time, but it is imperative that we find new crystals soon.

Captain's Log, supplemental. Mr. Sulu reports high energy tricorder readings from an area of the planet in which the creature has not yet been sighted. He has taken a small party, including Mr. Spock, to the high-elevation spot from which the readings emanate. I have begun to analyze the creature's movements. It seems to travel consistently over a set path. Perhaps we can corner it in a tunnel it seems to pass through frequently.

Captain's Log, stardate 54344.7. Mr. Sulu has located a cache of ACME dilithium crystals atop a high cliff. Regretfully, while collecting them, the edge of the cliff broke off, and he and Mr. Spock plummetted several hundred feet to the ground below. Strangely enough, they both survived the fall with no more than raising a cloud of dust on impact, although they did pass the chunk of rock on the way down and end up completely buried. A rescue excavation has commenced, and they should be safe shortly.

Captain's Log, stardate 54344.9. Mr. Spock has beamed up to the ship with them to assist Mr. Scott in their installation, as he forsees compatability problems. Back on the planet's surface, Mr. Chekov led seven men into the tunnel in an attempt to capture the creature in transit. A loud BEEP, BEEP was heard, and Chekov aimed the phaser rifle and commanded his men to spread out. I wish to state for the record that I would have acted similarly, and that Ensign Chekov should in no way be held responsible for the unfortunate circumstances arising from the unexpected appearance of an old Earth-style freight train. He has been beamed back up to the ship with minor injuries.
Captain's Log, stardate 54345.1. Dr. McCoy has beamed down with a hypo containing a mixture of kyranide, tri-ox compound, Scalosian concentrate, a theragram derivative, and some other items he found in unmarked containers in Sickbay. By injecting a small amount into each member of the landing party, I hope to be able to deal with the creature on its own high speed terms.
Captain's Log, supplemental. The latest experiment to deal with the strange creature has failed. As Dr. McCoy was injecting a measured dose of the compound, it abruptly appeared behind him and uttered a loud BEEP, BEEP! Dr. McCoy, understandably flustered, accidentally pressured in the entire contents of the hypo into his arm. A full security team is in pursuit of him, waiting for the effects of the drug to wear off.

Captain's Log, stardate 54345.2. I have ordered the landing party transported back to the ship. The new dilithium crystals have been successfully installed. On my responsibility, the ship is preparing to engage main phasers to attack the creature, which continues on its semi-erratic course across the planet's surface.
Captain's Log, supplemental. This is a warning to all other starships that may pass this way. Do not approach this planet! The illogical events occuring here are too much to overcome with simple science. If you have heard the events transcribed in the rest of this log, you will learn that this creature is nearly undefeatable. We channelled full ship's power through the phaser banks. Theoretically, the creature should have been destroyed; however, the energies were too much strain for the ACME crystals. The full force of the phasers backlashed over the Enterprise, engulfing her completely. At first, the only noticeable effect was a complete failure of all systems save emergency gravity and life support. Then a web of black lines spread through the Enterprise's superstructure. Next, the ship began breaking up, piece by piece, falling through the atmosphere to land on the surface of the planet. When the ship had collapsed entirely, my crew was left hanging in space for a short time, and finally each of us began to fall to the planet below. We have no theories on how any of us survived, but every crewmember has reported nothing more than a sense of uneasiness, followed by the realization that they were several hundred miles up in the air, a sinking sensation, and then a gradual drop: first the feet, then the body, and finally the head, usually wearing a resigned expression of perplexion. We are attempting now to communicate with the creature in the hopes that it will prove intelligent. Perhaps we can communicate our peaceful intentions to it. Mr. Spock has constructed a crude rocket launcher from the wreckage of the ship, and with this we hope to send the recorder marker up into space, where hopefully someone will find it.

Here's some of my favorites so far.

S4E6- The Raven. 
Stoic, precise Seven of Nine steals a shuttle to track down what she believes is a Borg homing device only to find the ship she was assimilated in. Watching Seven go from unfeeling Borg drone to a scared little girl in the span of seconds is frightening. 

S4E21- The Omega Directive 
Sensor readings set off a ship-wide alert. Only the Captain is high enough rank to have need-to-know clearance. However the Borg have assimilated many Starfleet captains and Seven also has knowledge of the Omega particle, a material so dense with energy that had the potential to destroy subspace throughout a sector, preventing Warp drive and potentially stranding Voyager in the Delta quadrant forever. The Borg believe the Omega particle to be perfection. Seven comes face to face with what she once believed to be her God. 

S4E25- One
A hostile nebula forces the crew into hibernation, leaving the Doctor and Seven to steward the ship all while battling the deleterious effects of the nebula on their own minds. The Mobile emitter goes offline and Seven is left to her own mind, a scary place for a former Borg. 

S5E2- Drone
We watch seven cope with newfound 'motherhood' after her nanoprobes get frisky with the Doctor's emitter. We feel her hesitant pride in her offspring and the devastating loss when her child, One, sacrifices himself to save the ship. ""Stop, you're hurting me""

And finally the episode that compelled me to write all of this 

S5E7- Infinite Regress
Voyager approaches the remains of a Borg ship devoured from the inside by a biological computer virus. What remains of the damaged core attempts to reintegrate Seven into the collective. However the damaged core instead starts dumping random imprisoned personalities into Seven's brain. We watch as she morph from Klingon to Human, to Ferengi, to Vulcan. She switches from a devout follower of the Ferengi ""Rules of Acquisition"" to a bereaved mother looking for her son before the battle of Wolf-359.",startrek,nardole_hackerman,False,/r/startrek/comments/i9i8xv/an_ode_to_jeri_ryan/

iirc in season 1 of TNG Yar said she had level 3 hand to hand combat or something similar and Riker or someone else replied they would be fine. Proceeds to have a horrible fight...

16,MINOR LDS SPOILERS EP 2: What Boimler knowing about S31 means,1597356028,"Theres a throwaway joke in the latest Lower Decks where Boimler states ""Section 31 does this"" (in referance to his speed walking).

Boimler is one of ""the least important ensigns on the least important ship"", as we so offten heard leading up to the series. So how does someone like Boimler, about 5 years after the end of DS9, know about S31? Not only does he know about it, he treats it like just another division of Starfleet and not something appalling like it should be to someone so by-the-book a year out of the academy.

When we leave DS9 it seems doubtfull S31 is in a position to be exsposed, and is never going to contact Bashir again. Meanwhile theres no reason for them to come out on their own. S31 worked for me in DS9 and Ent becouse it was a rouge agency awnsering to nobody. Discovery made it just another branch that ran around in starfleet branding, and this joke implies its a public organisation again for some reason.

This revelation should shake the Federation to it's core, yet Boimler is modeling his behavior after (what he thinks) they do. This further calls into question the latter attack on Mars, which should just scream ""Section 31 operation"" if you know they exsist. Yet we dont see evedence of this and the Romulans seem friendly with us (despite now knowing the events of Inna Arma whatever that title is were a set up).

What do you think is going on? Has the Federation tried to reform S31 after the morphagenic virus stuff got out? Could they even do that?

Additionally, it has a conflicting moral with the TNG episode ""The First Duty"". In this episode, Wesley makes a big mistake leading to the death of one of his friends. There's a big conflict between Starfleet and his peers about whether or not he should tell the truth. In the end, he decides that he should tell the truth, as the consequences would be easier to handle. Meanwhile in Lower Decks, they just lie about what they were doing and don't face any kind of dilemma. An animated Star Trek show can be good, but this isn't the way to go.

22,That Cardassian hologram doctor episode of Voyager,1597345739,"You know, the episode where B'ellana was mauled by a sentient space bug. The bug incapacitates her and doesn't let go. This was a fun episode.

The Doctor creates an assistant to help him with the procedures. Because apparently he can't just download the information into his brain. He needs a helper. As a side now... honestly? Why the fuck didn't this happen before? Why overwork Paris and turn him into a nurse when they could have always just given the doctor a helper?

Anyway, the maquis are obviously disturbed by their racist hate for Cardassians. ""I don't even the holograms."" When the Cardassian hologram goes on the fritz, Harry is called in to fix it. Harry grabs the first person he sees a fuckin' Bajoran maquis to help him out. I'm sure nothing could go wrong here. They fix the hologram and he when the Bajoran sees the hologram he goes, ""Woah, what the hell?"" Completely unaware, Tom goes, ""Hey, what's the problem man?"" Come on, Tom, if B'ellana doesn't like him, the Bajoran maquis isn't going to like him either, right bud?

Turns out the Cardassian in question was the Cardassian Josef Mengele. That figures, right? He advanced medical technology X-fold, but he also killed a bunch of Bajorans in the process. Of course, he's a hologram and isn't aware of any of that happening, but a faux moral quandary comes into the equation. Should we be using the medical research that this Cardassian acquired by immoral means to save lives?

Apparently that's a question here and, in fairness, the writers didn't go completely one sided with it(like they would have in DS9, sorry, I hate DS9). But it strongly implies that using his medical knowledge is immoral. But the captain is a badass bitch who saves B'ellana life and in the end they delete the Starfleet medical knowledge that this particular Cardassian produced.

The next episode they destroy a Borg probe and beam the debris aboard to scavenge anything good out of! Because using Borg technology has no moral implications at all! Even though they just establish that using Josef Cardassian Mengele's work is bad news bears at the end of the day. I actually do like that idea. The hypocrisy of man.

In any event though, I think this is a cut and dry philosophic argument. Tuvok is wrong when he says, ""Logically using the information is condoning the actions they took to obtain it."" Well, how far does that rabbit hole go? Using information from people who have done morally questionable things is bad? It's like throwing the baby out with the bathwater. How about you keep what's good and disavow what's bad? It's illogical to throw out useful correct information, because the person who obtained it did bad things to obtain it. BTW, things that you couldn't have done to stop it. You can say, ""Well, Megnele was a bad dude and should be killed for his experiments, but people in the future shouldn't die because we threw out his research.""

We can take the good from the evil and to not use that good to create more good would be evil in itself. Kinda of a weird syntax there. In other words, if you threw away his research would be an act of evil because you know it would negatively impact people's lives in the future.

As an adult and especially as a Star Trek fan I cannot fathom what anyone could possibly find even slightly entertaining about this show.  

To say the show is a poor rip off of a show which is itself a comedic ripoff of another and yet same show is weirdly meta but that’s exactly what it is.  One can imagine Seth MacFarlane (a huge Star Trek fan) pitching this idea; “You know how Star Trek is about the adventures of the Federation flagship and the crew who are the best of the best?   Well, my show is about the other guys.  The ones who didn’t graduate at the top of their class.”   

The Orville is the best Star Trek on TV right now.  It captures the spirit of the original Roddenberry vision of the future, an optimistic future where we ... well you know.  It’s just about a ship full of misfits and normal every day people.  

Lower Decks is just a poorly executed copy of this idea.  Strip away all the Next Generation sentimentality (my personal favorite show) and the resulting plot / character / and (most important) comedy laid bare are so poorly lacking that I was left just counting the minutes till it was over.  

If this is the content CBS is counting on to keep people subscribed to their channel, it won’t be around long.

The episode feels like a thriller, with enemies hiding in the shadow, friends turning to enemies, a hunter and the hunted, people dying one by one.  It's one of the most suspenseful episodes of the show.   
But it also has several clever lines and some light-hearted banter. Odo suggesting they'll ask Dukat for some supplies, Garak voicing his concern he'll be invited for dinner. When Nog checks an area, O'Brien and Garak are going on about riddles in the background.

In STII, Gamma Hydra (where Saavik says the Enterprise is on route to in the training simulation) is presumably the planet in the TOS episode The Deadly Years and specifically close the Romulan Neutral Zone (which was a key plot point in the story). So why are Klingons used in the simulation instead?

I know it was more economical to reuse the footage of the Klingon battlecruisers from TMP, but they could have said they were Romulan. And Kirk’s line “Klingons don’t take prisoners” was originally a Chekov quote (from the same episode) but he says “Romulans don’t take prisoners”.

I’ve always thought the Romulans were far more interesting as antagonists than the Klingons (and considering they only appeared in 2 episodes). From their Vulcan ancestry, to their well-developed characters, to their cloaking tech and birds of prey. Yet the Klingons literally got all the glory in the TOS movies. All the aspects which made the Romulans well-developed and interesting were grafted onto the Klingons instead. And it's such a shame (in my opinion).

___

**Episode 2 - ""Envoys""**

* Mariner and Tendi are pushing an anti-grav cart full of containers much like the kind that caused trouble in ""Hollow Pursuits.""
* Although the crews of previous series are constantly running into ""transdimensional energy creatures,"" this one most resembles the one seen in ""The Child.""
* Boimler mentions that Castro served on the *Enterprise.* This is not a reference to any known character, but it does highlight the idea that the *Enterprise* is the hip place to be for all Starfleet hopefuls.
* Mariner makes fun of Klingon names always having an apostrophe. The Klingon's name in this episode is spelled as ""K'orin"" in the subtitles.
* The hexagonal cargo containers in the maintenance bay's upper balcony are those seen laying around the background of the cargo bays during TNG.
* Boimler's Klingon greeting ""nuqneH"" was used in ""The Emissary.""
* Rutherford emerges from a Jefferies tube. These are the cramped passages in the innards of starships where engineers go if things get *really* serious.
* The shuttlecraft *Yosemite,* seen in the pilot, bears the same name as the starship that was trapped in a plasma thingy in ""Realm of Fear."" Yosemite National Park was also featured at the beginning of *The Final Frontier.*
* Engineering contains a central computer console much like the ""pool table"" on the *Enterprise-D.*
* While napping, Mariner mumbles the lines ""buried alive,"" ""marooned for eternity,"" and ""moons of Nibia,"" all spoken by the titular villain in *The Wrath of Khan.*
* K'orin's eyepatch has a design similar to the one sported by General Chang in *The Undiscovered Country.*
* I'm not certain the Klingon drinking song has been heard before, but singing while drinking blood wine is a favored pastime of the Empire.
* Raktajino is a common Klingon coffee.
* The Khitomer Accords were signed soon after the events of *The Undiscovered Country* and represent the peace treaty between the Federation and the Klingons. They were briefly rescinded when the two powers went to war during DS9.
* Boimler claims Section 31 likes to speedwalk. Section 31 is the shadowy covert ops wing of the Federation introduced in DS9 and subsequently blamed for every little thing that could be considered remotely nefarious.
* The Klingon vendor is selling gagh, the live worms and favorite snack of a warrior.
* Several different Klingon weapons are seen in this episode that were introduced in TNG.
* The purple-veined folks glaring at the officers are Kaelons, who were visited in ""Half a Life."" Their sun is dying, they kill themselves when they reach sixty, and they are perennial victims to Hawkeye's pranks.
* Rutherford is thrust into more than one simulation that could be considered a no-win scenario, much like the famous ""Kobayashi Maru"" featured in the films.
* Ransom recommends trying the ""Janeway Protocol,"" name-dropping the resolute captain of the *Voyager.* It's unclear what this protocol is supposed to be, but it definitely turns a benign situation into an unnecessarily catastrophic one.
* Boimler and Mariner arrive in what is clearly the ""Risa"" district of the planet, as we can see the forehead-dotted Risans and a giant horga'hn, the Risans' DTF symbol. Jamaharon, an R-rated activity on their paradise world, is brought up more than once.
* We've never seen an Anabaj before, but the likes of Harry Kim, Trip Tucker and others have been known to fall for the siren songs of pretty alien women to their detriment.
* The Borg in the battle program seem to be of the more simplistic visual design that was used when the baddies were introduced in TNG. They make typical Borgy noises and also represent multiple assimilated species like in *First Contact* and beyond.
* Shaxs invokes ""the name of the Prophets,"" customary for his Bajoran religion. The Prophets turned out to be the nonlinear aliens inhabiting the wormhole in DS9.
* The old Andorian turns out to be a Vendorian, a shapeshifting, personality-stealing creature first seen in ""The Survivor.""
* One of the aliens very briefly seen in the Andorian bar brawl looks a little bit like a Lurian, who we know mostly in the person of Morn.
* Mariner employs the ""Kirk hands"" combat maneuver which consists primarily of slightly elbowing an opponent to make him instantly collapse.
* The Ferengi were first introduced in ""The Last Outpost"" and later featured in DS9. This one faithfully represents their sniveling, finger-greedying, ""hyoo-mon""-speaking ways.",startrek,Antithesys,False,/r/startrek/comments/i8yxks/canon_references_envoys_spoilers/

The fandom menace has changed over time and it’s become more of a screaming contest over what sucks the most. They don’t give any new programs any chance just because it’s new. That’s all they do now, hate new shows and content from older products. Yeah sure it has a shitty director Alex Kurtzman and for Star Wars Kathleen Kennedy but if you look at her for a second, she approved unwillingly on the mandalorian which was a bit for fans. See the hypocrisy here? The program did well because it was based on older Star Wars and with something like the lower decks, you would think it would be the same but nooooo, people would complain and complain. Sounds familiar? Yes. It’s the fandom menace convincing the general media to hate lower decks just because of straight up stupid claims and the fact that it’s made by the same person who did Rick and Morty. Do you know why you are hated by the R&amp;M fans? Because you don’t understand both shows! It’s that simple! The fact that people are refusing to understand what is happening in a program because of one guy or another is completely stupid and should not be happening. Rick and Morty was support to be some science action adventure sitcom which it does well at if you were to watch the fucking episodes. Sure the Lower Decks is trying to be the same because it’s the same creator. He has watched trek you MFs and if you think he doesn’t know trek is a mistake on YOU’RE part. Lower Decks has 3 general soft plots on a single episode and Rick and Morty is like a typical Family Guy esk series with some adventures when the episode called for it.

Why didn't Picard ever go back to the Baku planet between Insurrection and Picard and spend some time there rejuvenating? I'm sorry you might convince me that people might want to have finite existences but nobody enjoys the ravages of aging and a phaser to the head can end your life just fine when you're ready to die. 

As a corollary, if I were Picard in ST:Picard I'd be saying a big fuck you to whoever built an android body for me but made it look and function exactly like my withered old man body complete with getting winded climbing stairs, needing to pee every ten minutes, being weak and feeble and having diminished cognitive capacity, and oh yes, aging and finite lifespan.

Since there’s a warp drive I’m assuming it’s easy for them to accelerate to near light speed, which means that from their point of view they could get back to earth almost instantly. 
Of course from the point of view of people on earth many years will go by.
Is that the reason to use a warp drive? Because this issue of time dilation somehow circumvented? Meaning you can go faster than speed of light but the clock ticks for you the same rate as if you were static compared to Earth?

69,Future Guy Wins,1597286962,"It is I, [Future Guy.](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mPcJFY2iCto/maxresdefault.jpg) Here to tell you why the Star Trek future is now ruined and the Federation won't happen.

I made a change. You missed it, but now everything's different.

Did you notice you didn't have any Eugenics Wars? That wasn't intended. Just a side-effect of the real change I made. They might have taught you a bit about the futility of the concepts of racial and genetic purity, but as I said, that change wasn't the key.

Here was the key: **You needed society to collapse due to nuclear war, to bring about the Star Trek future.**

Ironic, isn't it? I just needed to save humanity, just once, from a folly from which they would have recovered anyway, to doom the Federation.

In the utopic future of the Federation, we needed to be humbled by being  taken to ground, before we opened up to other possibilities. Our systems of greed and fear and power-mongering had to fail us, before we would be ready to change and meet a race like the Vulcans who advanced themselves to the stars with a social system designed entirely around logic.

Nuclear war devastated the rich, industrial nations in the original timeline. Only the countries with the means to arm themselves and their allies fight, and are devastated (for the most part), even in the limited nuclear exchange you might recall. Zephram Cochrane, far from the areas of devastation and the radiation in the remote countryside near an undestroyed silo, ironically used an unlaunched missile to make his warp ship and draw the attention of the Vulcans to usher in the future of  Federation unity. But it was, truly, the nuclear missiles that launched that ushered in the future of humanity's unity.

It was the humbling of the devastated enriched nations, their admitted folly at the outcome, and the sympathy and unity of the remaining groups of humanity that made us fit to meet the Vulcans. It is only through this that you see the diverse future of humanity at peace together. Once I made the alteration that removed that war, climate change became the instrument of this inevitable collapse, and its outcome ensures an entirely different future:

With collapse due to climate change, the poor, equatorial nations of 21st century Earth are hit hardest by the devastation. The industrialized,  enriched, colonial nations are not devastated and are instead in a position to deploy their riches and technology to ameliorate the devastation only for their own people, and only completely for the richest among them, dividing them ever further from within. These rich nations close their borders, wall up their borders in fact, and redefine their social contracts and their basic humanity as they allow billions to die around them gradually as they excuse their inaction to themselves, rather than helplessly have billions taken from among their own ranks instantly by a nuclear fire incapable of mercy.

This simple change prevents humanity from ever uniting. There is no clearing the account for billions allowed to die intentionally, billions turned away, billions murdered by negligence, malfeasance, greed, and selfish fear. The scars of climate change collapse and the wars it inspires instead will spark the blood feuds that will follow humanity the rest of its days, whether that be all the way to the end of its long journey to  the stars, or, more likely, shortly afterward isolated forever on the planet they will leave incapable of sustaining any life at all.

To my non-native ears, TNG conversations seem normal, and I'd mostly place the register somewhere between a popular science book and a natural discussion held by educated people. Of course there are epic, emotional or action-packed moments which make the speech more informal or elevated, but the majority of dialogue sounds like something real people could say, although probably in a discussion, debate, essay, article or TV program. Is it the same for you guys, who spoke English your whole life? Wouldn't I sound ridiculous if I speak in a manner similar to the one of Captain Picard, for instance?

3,"A call to arms: star fleet, is a fun game, but was it a squandered effort?",1597253771," 

This game was originally released in 2011, and was then re-released as ""Book one, revision two"" in 2016, and currently supplemented by ""Book two, early bird edition"" as of September 2019.

Designed as a way to play space battles set in the Star Fleet Universe without having to spend power points as in Star Fleet Battles / Federation Commander, this game allows for larger fleets of ships to duke it out without being bogged down by too many things to keep track of. I really thought this game would take off. It was fun, the ships looked cool, especially with the new bigger 2500 line of miniatures that came out for the game, and it scratched my space naval tabletop game itch that games like battlefleet gothic, firestorm armada, and x-wing attack wing had scratched before. But like other products released by Amarillo Design Beuro, I feel like the release was bogged down by problems, and supporting the game with new content has been bogged down by structural problems within the company, along with a nearly hibernating-bear like strategy as a company that has kept them in business for so long, but also has really kept them from reaching a bigger audience.

One problem I remember was Mongoose talking about the boxes of miniatures they produced, especially the fleet boxes, were basically being sold at a loss because the production cost of the miniature ships was high. And then, ADB was not happy with the specifics of how the rules of the game, and the stats for the space ships within that game, had turned out. This is why there is now a ""book one, revision two"".

Another problem is that there are thirteen different factions in the main setting of the Star Fleet Universe, along with some generic-ish starbases, freighters, etc, that could be used with any faction. But, only five factions were fleshed out in book 1.2 with a few ships of two other factions sprinkled in, and book 2 revamps and fleshes out those two factions, as well as adding in a third faction, and adding some new ships for the five existing factions. So right now there are eight out of thirteen factions that can be played in this game.

Granted, they hit probably the most recognizable/popular factions out of those available. The federation, klingons, and romulans, as well as adding in the gorn, kzinti, tholians, orions, and seltorians.

There is talk that book three will add the lyrans (and ldr), hyrans, and wyn cluster. Which will then only leave two+ missing factions, the ISC and Andromedans (and vudar? but who cares about them). BUT, book 3 has been in ""development muck"" for a while now, and it has been four years since the launch of book 1.2, and we are just barely now getting book 2.

One of the main problems, quite frankly, is Steve Cole's ability to do work, while not directly his fault, he has perhaps made choices of the years that have left him in poor health, he is turning himself around now, which I think is great, but his recovery has slowed down the production of everything the company does, with either the inability or unwillingness to delegate the final approval of work to be released without Steve C. working on it directly. I don't blame Steve for wanting to run his company the way he does, but I disagree with the choices he makes in how they are currently releasing products and believe that it is holding them back as a company, and keeping this new product from reaching new audiences.

I really felt like ACTA:SF could have been a popular game, it's got a great IP that it is affiliated with, the miniatures look great, especially with the new shapeways 3d printed miniatures, and there is a lot of work that has been done in creating new (not seen in TOS) factions that fill in the rest of the region of space as super powers to contend with.

Maybe it's not too late for this game to take off, but it has been nine years since its original launch, and that really seems like a boat that has been long missed.

If I were in charge, what would I do? It would be easy to soapbox, I don't run a business. I don't know what the TT game market is like, or what space/naval TT/miniature game market share is like. But I do know that CBS/Viacom/Paramount has been trying to revamp the Trek brand for a few years now with new TV series, the success/failure of these shows being neither here nor there, it is still a brand that is worth supporting over 50 years since it came out. With that in mind, here are some of my ideas.

Book 1 should have supported more total factions without putting as many ships in it per factions.

The federation got 19 ships, klingon 11, romulan 16, kzinti 11, and gorn 11 ships in book 1.2. I can appreciate wanting to have a variety of ships. But in a ""bigger fleet"" style game, fewer options that are more distinguished from each-other can be a better option than providing more options with a fine granulation between them.

In battlefleet gothic, the main factions of the Imperium only had 10 non escort ship classes, and 3 escort types, the chaos fleet had 10 non-escort ship classes, and 3 escort types. Sometimes even these felt like too many choices, some were always taken over others for example, but it was a nice limitation in choices.

I probably would have limited it to 8 ships for each faction, included the federation, klingon, romulan, gorn, kzinti, lyran, hydran, and orion pirates factions. This would roughly be the same number of ships total in the book, but would have given some good variety of contrasting factions to choose from, and limits the model line you need to produce to make the ships available to use. Heck, I'd probably try to squeeze the ISC, Seltoran, Tholian, and Andromedans in there too, and then maybe reduce it to 6 ships each.

This way, you get a lot of the heavy lifting done in the beginning by hammering out the special rules that need to be figured out for each faction that has special weapons, and you set the stage with most of the basic ships that would build the core of any fleet, the heavy cruiser, light cruiser, frigate, destroyer, battle cruiser, and dreadnought.

Then you can flesh out additional ship variations with special systems like carriers, scouts, battleships, x-ships, or whatever else in new books, with other things like ship refits where maybe you replace photon torpedoes with plasma, or phasers or drones, or whatever else.

Well, that's a lot off my chest, I dunno, what do you think?

11,Career progression in Starfleet: A semi-coherent rambling full of speculation and wild guesses.,1597240656,"So, first up all of this is just pure conjecture, based on random things I picked up over 20 years of watching Star Trek, and my own ideas of how I *think* it would work.   

Now, on to my ramblings.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&amp;#x200B;

To begin with, you'll apply to Starfleet Academy and take the entrance exams.  If you pass and are accepted, you begin the 4-year academy course.  I believe that during the first year you probably choose your career track, be it engineering, operations, science, or medical.  There are probably aptitude tests which help you figure out what you're best suited for. Then you probably specialise within that field in the 2nd or 3rd year.  During 4th year, if you've suitably impressed the instructors, you may be accepted into the Command Training Program, which I imagine pretty much does what it says on the box: trains you for Command.

Eventually, you graduate as an Ensign.  If you graduate toward the top of your class, you get your choice of assignment.  Most people probably pick a deep space exploration vessel, or one of the newest classes of Starship.  The rest of the class most likely get assigned as per the needs of Starfleet - most likely to an older *Excelsior* or something not quite so glamorous as a *Galaxy* or *Sovereign*\-Class.  Maybe even Starbase duty or planetary duty.  (In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if Starfleet regularly rotates officers between fleet duty and base duty, to give everyone their fair share of both).

When you get to your first posting, as a brand new Ensign you probably don't get much in the way of authority or responsibility.  Although you *are* an officer and may have a team of enlisted crewmembers reporting to you, your primary job at this point is still to learn - both from your direct superior(s) as well as from the senior enlisted, who may have been in Starfleet longer than you've been alive.  Prove yourself, and you'll start to earn more responsibility, and eventually that first promotion to Lieutenant, Junior Grade.

Depending on the size of your ship or base, as a Lt JG you could be serving as the second-in-command or even the officer commanding a sub-division of your field.  (For example, you might be in charge or second-in-charge of Stellar Cartography, within the Science Division.)

If you've graduated from the Command Training Program, you might have a shot at immediately becoming a Bridge Officer, where you might get to man the helm, or one of the other random background bridge stations.  After a few years and a promotion to Lt JG or Lieutenant (depending on the size of the ship or base), you may even start commanding a ""night"" shift.   But even if you don't get an immediate Bridge Officer spot, being a CTP graduate is almost certainly good for your career - if not a bridge officer you might even get to step directly into a command role within your chosen division.

Promotion to full Lieutenant probably comes within about 5 years on average.   On small ships, Lieutenants would be your department heads: Operations Officers, Chief Engineers, Tactical Officers, etc.  On larger ships they're more likely to be heading the subdivisions of those departments, with the most senior Lt serving as second-in-command of the department.  This is where you start getting your real command experience, and for the majority of officers, your first chance at serving on the bridge.   
 Command-track officers, upon reaching the rank of Lieutenant, are probably beginning to stand as Officer On Watch while the Senior Staff are absent from the bridge, or off duty.

By this point, you most likely know your chosen career field well, and are becoming comfortable with a bit more authority, so as a Lieutenant you're probably going to begin to get in some further training, perhaps some post-graduate study, take opportunities to cross-train with other departments, and learn more about the overall running of a ship or starbase, outside just your own department.   As a result, you're probably going to spend a few years at this rank in order to make the most out of the opportunities available, which will help prepare you for the next step in your career: promotion to Lieutenant Commander.

As a Lieutenant Commander, if you're a command-track officer, you're probably going to get an Executive Officer posting on a smaller ship such as an *Intrepid*\-class, or a more remote starbase.  Otherwise, I believe you might be expected to temporarily transfer across to the Operations or Security divisions, get some quick on-the-job training, and spend a couple of years running a department in order to get some direct command and leadership experience.

 If not command-track, then as a Lt Cmdr you're likely to be a department head on a big ship or more important base.  In the medical department, I believe Lt Commander is probably the minimum rank you'll need to achieve before becoming the Chief Medical Officer on a starship.  (Side note: seeing as Dr Bashir was CMO of DS9 as a Lt JG, it would seem like this is not the case for starbases.  Probably because they have a lot fewer unknown medical scenarios to encounter than a starship, so the job doesn't require as much experience).  

The downside is, now you're starting to get to the point in your career where you're doing more management work than getting stuck in to the real work that you trained to do.  You'll spend more time delegating tasks to others, instead of doing them yourself.  The upside however is that this gives you the opportunity to make use of your years of experience and start mentoring the junior officers.

After a few more years, as long as you meet the requirements, you'll be promoted again to Commander.   As command track, you might be assigned as Executive Officer of one of the ""cool"" ships or a large starbase, or commander of a smaller base.    If you're not command-track, then you're probably going to be moving into a senior administrative or research position back on one of the core worlds of the Federation.   However, in a few cases, you may also be able to take and pass the Bridge Officers' Course, allowing you to exchange your gold or blue uniform for a red one and continue your career progression by becoming an XO.  (I believe Eddington was exaggerating when he said you don't get to sit in the captain's chair wearing a gold uniform.  I believe he failed or was rejected for transfer to command-track, and tried to console himself by believing the deck was stacked against him.)

Then comes what almost all Starfleet officers aspire to: promotion to the rank of Captain.  In a lot of modern navies, smaller vessels are often commanded by Commanders or Lt Commanders, however in Starfleet it seems that most if not all starship captains actually hold the rank of Captain.  I believe this is because Starfleet wants its starship commanders to have a full career's worth of experience before taking command of a starship.  Especially as you never know what kind of situations they may run into.  But, of course, you can still be a captain without being a starship commander.  Captains are most likely senior staff at Starfleet Command, or responsible for administration of entire divisions (medical, engineering, science, etc) across the entire fleet.

Your first command is most likely not going to be glamorous.  You'll almost certainly be commanding one of the smaller and/or older ship operating deep within Federation territory, doing so-called milk runs, or patrolling the Romulan Neutral Zone, or cataloging spatial phenomenon.  While not the most exciting, your early command/s are going to be a necessary stepping stone to bigger and better things, providing you with needed experience in the captain's chair.  Prove yourself here, and if you're lucky you'll get a shot at one of the *Galaxy's* or *Sovereigns*, or a similarly more modern class of starship, out on the edge of Federation territory, exploring the unknown and boldly going where no-one has gone before.  

But to get to this point, you will have had to do a lot of additional study and training, in things like diplomacy, first contact, negotiation, mediation, and advanced tactical training.  After all, you'll be thousands of light-years from Starfleet Command, and Starfleet needs to be sure you can think and operate independently without having to call home for orders.

After spending so long to get to this point, you're probably going to want to spend as much time commanding a starship as you can.  However, eventually Starfleet Command is going to expect you to make room for someone else to have their shot and offer you a promotion to Admiral.  And unless you've distinguished yourself to the point where Starfleet Command dare not touch you, it'll be either up or out.

If you go up into the Admiralty, you'll be able to use your decades of experience to hopefully guide Starfleet in a positive direction.  Or you may be required to get back into the captain's chair as a fleet or task force commander in the event of a major battle or operation.   Who knows, you may even become the next Chief of Starfleet Operations or even Commander-in-Chief of Starfleet.  All you can know, when you take those first steps through the entrance of Starfleet Academy, is that your opportunities are almost limitless.

- Also, Ezri Dax mentions that she didn’t receive proper training on being joined that normally happens, because the Dax symbiont took a turn for the worse, and she was the only Trill on the ship.

They could take inspiration from the real drama that took place on the show- the clash of Shatner and Nimoy's egos, the constant danger of cancellation, famously subversive moments like the kiss between Kirk and Uhura. It could deal frankly with the sexism and racism of the sixties while also presenting characters who struggle to rise above it, like maybe a female writer and editor inspired by DC Fontana.

18,The reboot we need now more than ever: Erik Jendrensen's Star Trek The Beginning,1597229630,"For those who dont know, a trilogy of films was planned in the mid 2000s, before a regime change at Paramount and JJ Abrahms being brought abord. The first, Star Trek the Beginning, was the only one really fleshed out, but it ticks a lot of boxes for me.

The film would bridge the time between Enterprise and TOS, and was penned by Band of Brothers writer Erik Jendresen. They were ""war films"" about the Earth-Romulan conflit. The plot seems rooted in reality, not dependant on big budget set pieces, and with some very Star Trekky themes. Kirk's ancestor is a central character. I'm wary of prequels after all those we've seen of late, but this one seems fresh. 

I've been dreaming of these movies since reading about the script leaks at the time. [AICN featured an overview of the story based on leaked script](http://legacy.aintitcool.com/node/34635) which was our best glimpse.

19,Crazy(?) Possibility for how Georgiou changes her attitude then goes back in time to lead Section 31,1597229502,"This has been bugging me ever since we learned there will be a Section 31 with Georgiou as the lead. 

Georgiou, as she is at the end of Discovery S2 would never believe in the Federation enough to lead Section 31 as an organization that works to protect the Federation. Plus, how does she get back in time to lead Section 31? WHEN is she leading it in time? How does she get there/then?

We know that Georgiou was on the USS Discovery when it’s sent far into the future.
We know that Georgiou is from the mirror universe.
We know that Georgiou’s mirror universe has mostly everything the prime universe has (same people, races, planets).

Crazy idea:

What if there’s a mirror Guardian (“The City at the Edge of Forever,” “Yesteryear”)? Maybe Georgiou knows about the Guardian and its location?

My thought is that, after learning some lessons from the Future...maybe even traveling to the “future mirror universe” where Terrans have changed to something closer to the Federation (possible given DS9’s mirror universe episodes)? And the current “Prime future” humans are now more like the Terrans from the Terran Empire?

Experiences from learning all of this might have Georgiou changing her beliefs, and wanting to keep the Federation’s ideals intact into the new future she has seen, so as to never allow them to change like she sees them in the Prime future. So, in the prime universe (or maybe even the mirror universe??) she travels to the Guardian planet and uses the Guardian to travel back in time to help Section 31 maintain Federation values.

Time travel might not be with the Guardian. Maybe a ship “whiplashing” around a star. But some easy and known time travel would probably be needed if her travel back in time is to be seen as intentional.

It happened with Discovery and then with Picard. I don't know why its so unpopular to voice any criticism on this sub - e.g. on r/television most people agreed that Picard was disappointing. Full of plot holes, a rambling nonsensical plot and reduces Picard to a fraction of what he should be, instead of the show we were promised.

I look at Trek and see the same thing that happened to Star Wars reboot - a populist remake designed for new audiences with absolutely no understanding of the core themes, wilful destruction of respected ideas, just to be 'different'. 

People defended the new SW movies when they came out just as they defended all the new Trek shows here even when it was obvious where they were headed. Dark, cynical, everyone is evil, dystopian with no hope, no exploration, no Trek ideals. And people just kept saying - if you want the same old go watch the old shows.

All the new SW movies are pretty much garbage. They did well of course - you could put a turd in a box and it would sell well with that name. But even billion dollar box office couldn't hide how bad they are.

The first half of this episode was lots of fun because the crew was so into the race. Tom and Harry were eager to race and get a pit crew to help tune up the flyer. Neelix schools Seven in the art of race commentating. Captain Janeway and Chakotay tell Tuvok to buzz off with his security blabber because they've got a race to watch.

The story takes a less feel-good turn when one of the aliens tries sabotaging the Delta Flyer to explode and kill everyone. Tom and B'Elanna change course and lose the race on purpose to save the day. Tom proposes to B'Elanna, happily ever after.

I loved the first half of the episode. Reminded me a lot of watching Speed Racer as a kid. I do wish the episode stayed with the race instead of deviating off course with the sabotage plot and Tom and B'Elanna's relationship troubles.

51,"Star Trek 2009 and J. J. Abrams saved Star Trek, and deserve a little more credit.",1597185549,"Its always bothered me that it seems to be an article of faith for many around here that one of the [highest grossing and best reviewed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Star_Trek_films_and_television_series) of all the Trek films is in fact terrible.  You can't seem to bring it up without various people appearing to let you know that J.J. Abrams is a hack, lens flares, and that Trek would be better if it just got back to whatever they think the golden era was.  So here's my alternative thesis: the current era of Trek, in which there are 3+ new shows with several more in development, wouldn't exist at all if not for Trek 2009.  

[Here's an incredible graph of all of Trek's Nielsen Ratings since the beginning of TNG.](https://i.imgur.com/ifsza4T.jpg)  According to this, TNG is the only Trek show that gained viewers over time, peaking around 1993 (around the same time that DS9 Premiered).  Every other Trek show declined significantly over its run, each of which started from a lower initial value.  By 2005, Trek had gone from viewership numbers that could support multiple shows to a tiny number of viewers unable to support Enterprise on a basic cable network.  The TNG film series followed a similar pattern, peaking (in box office terms) with First Contact before declining commercially and critically with Insurrection and Nemesis (which with advertising taken into account probably lost money). 

So, this is the world into which Paramount decided to spend $150 million to make Star Trek 2009, which frankly in retrospect seems like a ludicrous gamble.  No Trek movie had ever grossed more than $150 million, which is what Trek 2009 would have to make just to break even.  And yet, somehow, Trek 2009 was a huge hit, grossing \~$400 million and spawning two sequels (including the more derided Into Darkness, which actually made even more money).

Imagine instead a world where Trek 2009 had flopped.  I submit that in that world, Trek might have died right there and then.  Trek 2009 managed to do two things that no Trek property since TNG had done: 1 - Prove that there was still a huge market for trek and **2 - Actually bring in new fans**.   Trek is a 60 year old franchise, demographically it can't sustain itself without new fans.  Every Trek property since from TNG to Enterprise was subject to brutal diminishing returns, with falling viewership over time. So, while some fans may not like Trek 2009, I think we should at least appreciate that it gave new life to a franchise that otherwise could have dwindled into obscurity, irrelevance, and eventual death.

62,More accents!,1597174715,"Well, not just accents. But more cultural diversity.

When it comes to the notion of diversity, Star Trek is quite distinct from other franchises in that it not only means distinct races/genders/orientations, but also different species. This is the natural progression of a hyper-inclusive society, which seeks out new life and includes it in the mission to seek even more life. TNG doesn't just have men, women, black people, white people, but also a Klingon and an android. But we all know this. 

What bugs me just a little about Star Trek since older days is a lack of cultural diversity, particularly in the portrayal of the different accents. I'll break it down, and for simplicity's sake I will not distinguish between variations of American accents. Obviously there are plenty of variations therein but everyone talks differently. I don't wanna just list every character. I am also doing solely the main casts. 

TOS - 4
American (Kirk)
Scottish (Scotty)
Russian (Chekov)
Japanese (Sulu)

TNG 3
American (Riker)
English/French? (Picard)
English/Greek? (Troi)

70,A theory on why it's so hard to write stuff long time Trek fans will like. [Effort],1597162330,"Modern Trek has its merits, but for a lot of us it doesn't really *scratch that Trek itch,* and I've been giving some thought to why that might be.  

If I asked you: ""What does it mean to be a Trek fan?""  

You would probably give me a quite literal answer: ""Well, it means they like something in the Star Trek universe.""  

Now some people might try to gatekeep, right?  ""You're only a Trek fan if you've read Gene Roddenberry's discarded drunken napkin ramblings.""  Me, I'm a little more generous.  You read a book?  Welcome to the fandom.  You heard an audiodrama?  We got room at the table.  Like the Lower Decks?  You sit over there.  You're fine, but you sit over there.  Enjoyed any of the television shows, one of the movies, saw the Family Guy episode?  Come on in.  Like, I don't give a shit, all are welcome, you like the pointy ears and have a cute elf cosplay?  DM me, we'll talk.  (I kid about the Lower Decks, I haven't seen it, for all I know it could be a great show, and fans of the show are, of course, more than welcome to join us in the fandom.)  
 
Anyway, back on topic, a Star Trek fan, broadly speaking, can mean many different things to many different people.  Those of us who exclusively know Star Trek through TV and movies definitely have a *ranking,* we all have favorites, there's no shame in it, it's natural, we compare one to another to all the rest.  There are people who will fight you to the death that Deep Space Nine is just a liiiitle bit better than The Next Generation (Me, I'm that person, fight me me), and then there's the guy who liked The Original Series the best and was very sorely disappointed in the lack of styrofoam boulders in later iteration, or the fan who thought Enterprise was just awesome, some folks unironically love Voyager.  There's a wide variety of ""favorites"" among the fandom, this isn't like Star Wars where the lists all start with Empire Strikes Back at #1, y'know, Star Trek fandom comes from all directions.  

Wanna' hear some blasphemy?  I really loved First Contact, it's probably my second favorite Trek movie.  I know they say it's not Treky, which is an honest critique, but as a lover of TNG I feel like it was an excellent pay off to a plot that was a long time in the making, it wasn't Treky, but it *was* a pretty good movie, very well executed, and an excellent climax for the series.  It's a shame they never made any more TNG movies after that.  My *favorite* Trek movie, on the other hand, is the Motion Picture, that is just a beautiful, surreal, thoughtful film, it was slow, it was, dare I say it, philosophical.  I haven't watched it recently, but to my memory I don't think there's much, if any, *phaser fire* in that movie.  What's the point I'm getting at?  
  
The point I'm getting at is that when you draw a venn diagram of ""What the average Trek fan likes,"" you wind up with a *lot* of circles, and while there is a massive amount of overlap, that doesn't mean that there's necessarily more *inside* the center circle than there is *outside* the center circle.  ""All Trek fans like *this""* makes for a very *narrow* definition.    
  
I don't wonder sometimes if modern Trek is maybe focusing too much on the center of the venn diagram and as a result they're not taking enough risks, or injecting enough variety into their productions.  We all think they're writing for the broadest audience possible, but what if it's the opposite, and they're actually doing their best to *hyper target* the ""average"" Trek viewer.  

I *loved* Deep Space Nine's serialized story line (We don't talk about the last episode.)  

Other people *loved* Voyager and TNG's episodic story lines.  

How does a writer split the difference on that?  There's not a lot of overlap there.  I'm thinking of the Simpsons episode with that utterly confused focus tester, I need to find that gif later, somebody knows what I'm talking about.  
  
Like, watching these modern shows, there are a *lot* of nods to previous Trek, we would call them easter eggs, but they represent somebody taking the time to write story elements that would tie into the canon (often, not always, don't DM me.)  If we were, *hypothetically,* to give these people the benefit of the doubt for a moment (No, I said DON'T DM me!) I think a case could be made that they're hyper targeting new Trek to us, which, unfortunately, sort of goes against the old Trek philosophy.  

Old Trek, episodic, 25 episode Trek, had a *ton* of diversity and variety in its storytelling, the viewer never *quite knew* what the next episode would be.  

Hard sci-fi episode?  
Philosophical conundrum episode?  
Funny episode?  
Buddy episode?  
Full ensemble episode?  
Time travel episode?  
Holodeck malfunction episode?  
Transporter malfunction episode?  
Ship/Station malfunction episode?  
Battle episode?  
Bottle episode?  
Q episode?  
Big scary monster episode?  
Everybody is asleep episode?  
Good old fashioned mystery episode?    

(That's fifteen pretty common Star Trek story lines, which is five episodes longer than a new Star Trek season runs.)  
  
This may sound dumb, but hear me out, I think there's something to be said for the fact that one of the biggest things that classic Trek had in common was that they ran 20+ episodes, and that allowed them to inject a lot of variation and variety into what they gave us, this meant that the Trek fandom could be kind of really big.  If I like 60% of the episodes in a 25 episode season, that's 15 hours worth of enjoyment, if I like 60% of a 10 hour season that's only six, which means that holy shit the margin for error in making a bad episode is really high!  One bad showing is 10% of the season, two or three bad episodes in a row and that's a whole chunk of a season, which can be enough to turn people off.  And obviously, mathematically, this is an incredibly dumb thing to say, because it's completely obvious, but on a *subjective level,* the *subjective* value and worth and appraisal of those things, how we perceive them, is what makes the numbers significant.  Put simply, having massive seasons allowed the writers to take risks that they cannot take in smaller seasons, there's no room in a tense, tight, Discovery arc for a ""We got sent back in time and now we have to deal with tribbles"" episode, there's no time for a ""Data explores his humanity"" episode, there's no opportunity for a ""Janeway is suffering low grade depression"" episode.  It's all just story, story, story, because it's *gotta' be.*  

I'm sorry, I got off track.  One of the nice things about Trek is that no two episodes are quite the same (Except when Voyager got caught in ""voids,"" which seemed to happen quite a lot), no two movies are ever quite the same, it's the variety and diversity that made the show fun, how do you quantify variety and diversity in a focus test, though?  The appeal of Star Trek is like a venn diagram with hundreds of little circles, we could go down to an episode by episode basis if we wanted to.  
  
I guess what I'm saying is that Star Trek isn't any *one* thing, at least it hasn't been since the 1960's.  Star Trek means a lot of different things to a lot of different people.  Our fandom spans decades, it spans medium, it spans cultures, the audience is pretty diverse, because Star Trek has always been a pretty diverse show, some folks love the philosophy, some folks love the sci fi, some folks love the tongue in cheek humor and the spectacle of spandex.  I guess what I'm saying is that modern Trek, while excellent in its own respects and regards, feels a little homogenized sometimes, like it's *just one thing,* when Trek has never been *just one thing* before.  
  
I'm certain that it's possible to inject variety and diversity of story telling into a serialized show, but I think that it will have to be done *intentionally.*  Serialization doesn't lend itself to variety, and variety is the heart of Star Trek.",startrek,MaximumEffort433,False,/r/startrek/comments/i7ukc7/a_theory_on_why_its_so_hard_to_write_stuff_long/

88,I've got a weird question about fandom depictions in popular culture,1597135222,"I am sure that sketches and jokes mocking *Star Trek* (and other genre franchises) were a thing very early on, as soon as these franchises became reasonably well-known and popular. 

But what I have been wondering lately is when it became a thing to make fun of 

a) fans/fandom 

and especially

b) conventions (you know, Comic-Con type stuff) - *Galaxy Quest* would be a prime example.

The former must have been a thing in teen comedies in the '80s, I assume? But the latter? 

I am asking this question because I watched the TV-show *She-Wolf of London* a while ago, and the episode ""Beyond the Beyond"" takes place at a convention (modelled in part, I believe, on TOS). While it makes more fun of the ficticious actors than the ficticious fans, it is the depiction of a convention as a ""thing"" that made me wonder.

My way of thinking was this: To make fun of a show, or of its fans, all a filmmaker/episode-writer ""merely"" has to feel sure that a reasonably large part of the audience knows that that show exists. But in order to be able to make fun of conventions, you need to feel sure that your audience knows what the hell a convention is, and that is probably a significantly higher hurdle. 

""Beyond the Beyond"" aired in February of 1991, and while it was certainly trying to ride the coat-tails of the recent success of TNG, I have a hard time believing that TV-news or newspapers were brimming with reports from Comic-Con or some other convention, especially not in the UK (*She-Wolf of London* was a UK-US co-production). The internet did not exist [yes, I know, no need to nitpick], and I wonder how many people knew that conventions were a thing.

So I was wondering, does anyone know of a fun, mocking depiction in a film or TV-show before 1991 that features a convention?

Things I want to do in this game

1. Clean up the holodeck.     
2. Fix Replicators.     
3. Treat Ingrown Toe Nails.     
4. Scan for signs of life.  
5. Crawl in a maze of Jeffries tubes to fix EPS Conduit #3452 (powers the Captain's Sonic shower specifically).     
6. Calibrate phaser targeting sensors.     
7. Load Torpedo Tubes.     

Etc.    

How I figured the game could work:

Players can host servers, with each server being a ship with 32+ people able to be online at a time. The server owner can pick the Captain player, who picks the Senior Staff and sets the Chain of Command. The ship staff are broken into Divisions like Tactical, Engineering and Science. When you join a game you pick one of those roles, and as you do various things, you learn skills, and can do things more accurately or faster. Perhaps as you level up, your skills become more specialized. Different tasks might require a person of a certain rank and division leaders can promote/demote people.

The Captain and/or other Senior Staff can either schedule or manually activate certain scripts like a hostile ship encounter, or 1st Contact, or the ship randomly breaking down (or perhaps a lot of this is just random) for more exciting things to do.

But outside of these scenarios, your job is to keep the ship running in top shape. If there isn't anything else to do, you can hang out in Ten Forward, or use some Holo Deck credits to run a lesure activity. There could be some mini games you could play with other people. You could also practice your skill on already functioning equipment to try to level up your skills, or do training drills.

&gt; TUVOK: Thank you. Welcome to the first night of Prixin, the Talaxian observance of familial allegiance.

Without them, we could not call ourselves complete. On this day, we are thankful to be together. We do not stand alone.

I went in blind having little to no information other than the face palm picard and the recent quark/garak root beer gif.  The Star Trek presented in this era was if not the epitome of original story telling I have seen in a show.  I started with TNG and although the first 2 seasons needed 'origin' stories for each of their respective characters it was incredibly solid and engaging (hehe I see what i did there) plots minus that weird one where Dr. Crusher gets raped by Robin William's Flubber.  TNG is family then moving on to DS9 is where I really get hooked into Star Trek as a whole.  The mixture of episodic and serialization was pure perfection.  MY BOY ROM.  Now this is where the gushing starts to stagnate.  It definitely took up until mid season 3 to actually start getting invested but I couldn't help thinking when watching was 'damn i wonder what the TNG/DS9 crew are doin during this period.  Voyager was okay for me but IMO not as engaging as the previous TNG and DS9.  Although I finished these 3 series I find myself in a void.  I am not sure whether or not to continue to ENT or to proceed ahead to current gen such as PIC or DSC.

I saw on Twitter yesterday that there are rumours of a show, [here is the link](https://wegotthiscovered.com/tv/cbs-reportedly-discussing-star-trek-picard-spinoff-janeway/).

&gt;CBS is reportedly discussing a potential *Picard* spinoff for Kate Mulgrew. We Got This Covered has heard from our sources – the same ones who said **a Captain Pike series is in the works**, which has **now been confirmed** – that the network is interested in the idea, given how successful Stewart’s comeback has proven to be. Nothing has been set in stone just yet, but we’re told it’s indeed being discussed.  
&gt;  
&gt;Apparently, CBS want to test the waters for the project by bringing Mulgrew back in a future season of *Picard.* **As we’ve already shared**, there are plans for Janeway to return for a small role or cameo on the show. It’s unclear whether this would be in season 2 or 3, but if fan response is positive and the actress is up for it, then the concept may get the green light.

Personally, I think it would be interesting if Janeway finally had to come to terms with the atrocities she committed in the Delta quadrant. Rather than facing any consequences she was hailed a hero and promoted to vice admiral, despite breaking the prime directive on numerous occasions and being directly responsible for the loss of untold (at least billions, we can assume) lives by aiding the Borg.

I personally don't see anything wrong with it.

But then scenes like when Mariner and Boimler were on the planet, eventually in their underwear, or when Mariner started the nude olympic training holodeck program were meant for a slightly more mature audience.

However I was thinking about how the show might continue depict the sexuality of Aliens? For me, I'd like the show to avoid transposing western human concepts of sexuality like ""gay"" or ""Bi"" onto aliens and really flesh out the culture around sexuality and gender in alien cultures as unique to themselves. For example Vulcans have a Pon Farr and that has to alter their relationships and views of sexuality in a way that's distinct from humans. I'd be more interested in exploring this than assigning human sexuality to them. Perhaps Strange New Worlds can explore what it's like for different concepts of gender and sex from different Alien cultures to interact with each other.

94,How to Resurrect Trek (an essay I wrote on how we have lost sight of what makes Trek special),1597014495,"I’m the youngest *Star Trek* fan that I’ve ever met, and that’s a problem.

For reference, I was born in 2001, at the end of what I would consider to be the Golden Age of Trek. Before (i)PADDs actually existed, before Netflix was a household name, my 9-year-old self discovered Trek through grainy, late-night reruns. When I first fell in love with *The Next Generation*, and its cast of curious dorks, I saw myself in them: the questions they asked, their bold optimism, their struggle for self-betterment and their sense of adventure. *Voyager* and *Deep Space Nine* similarly broadened my perspective on life. The entire franchise gave me hope for the future, for my future.

The *Star Trek* that I just described, the *Star Trek* that helps young dorks like me feel a little less lonely, the *Star Trek* that inspires the diplomats, scientists and artists of tomorrow, that *Star Trek*, is in a **coma**. To bring it out of that coma, we first need to recognize its symptoms.

Let’s do a quick, spoiler-minimal recap of the past two decades of Trek, kicking things off with 2002’s *Nemesis*. Though there were a few highlights, this gritty, action-oriented product lacked the heart and wit that made *TNG* special. The next release, *Enterprise*, offered some lovably campy episodes, but left something to be desired in its uniform cast of mostly bland characters. Then come the J.J. Abrams movies, which feel more like poorly executed *Star Wars* movies than anything remotely true to *Star Trek*: they rely on cheap nostalgia, laser battles, lens flares and other impressive visual effects to carry a story that lacks moral ambiguity, or moral intent whatsoever. On their own, they’re not terrible movies, but they detract from the franchise in neglecting the philosophical and social commentary that made 90s Trek so inspiring. Moving on to CBS All-Access Trek, Discovery and Picard both sport dark, gritty plot-lines, portraying a less optimistic future for the Federation. More so in Picard, the exclusively serialized format restricts the show’s ability to more broadly explore its themes. Both series also suffer from a case of Abrams-esque laser battles. I list all of these grievances not as an attack against the aforementioned works of art, but as constructive criticism.

**In analyzing the components of less favored Trek properties, some recognizable patterns emerge:**

* excessively dark and gritty dystopian settings
* characters that don’t leave you wanting more
   * caring about them feels forced
* substituting real heart for cheap nostalgia
* laser battles supplanting real substance
* heavy serialization

**To face an ugly truth, all of the elements listed above have defined** ***Star Trek*** **for my generation.** If *Star Trek* is to be restored to its former glory, all of these flaws must be addressed.

Now that we understand the flaws of new Trek, let’s return to classic Trek. **What components made the Golden Age of Trek (1987-2002) so golden?** What *about* these shows inspired generations of dorks to change the world? Well, it’s actually quite a simple formula.

The following sentence could be used to describe *TNG*, *DS9*, *VOY* and *ENT*: *An ensemble cast of quirky characters address episodic and serialized socio-philosophical conflicts through the lens of science fiction.* Basically, it’s a soap opera about ethics in an outlandish setting, made palatable by two essential components:

1. *Characters to whom we become emotionally attached through their down-to-earth quirks and struggles.*
2. *The struggles these characters face are tied to sci-fi analogies that*
   1. *raise philosophical questions,*
   2. *act as real-world social commentary,*
   3. *or do both.*

Let's address both of these needs:

**1)** *In terms of character, there is a very clear formula by which most characters from the aforementioned Trek series abide, in some capacity.* Every *TNG*, *VOY* and *DS9* series regular fits relatively well into 6-7 Trek Archetypes:

* *stubborn, self-righteous, collected, badass when needed* \- Picard, Sisko/Kira, Janeway
* *emotionally removed person discovering their humanity* \- Data, Odo, Seven/The Doctor
* *not-so-suave, often dorky, flyboy* \- Riker, Bashir, Tom Paris 
* *frustrated warrior with mixed feelings about their heritage* \- Worf, B'Elanna
* *wise support system, sometimes badass* \- Guinan/Crusher/Troi, Dax, Chakotay
* *adorably simple buddy* \- Geordi, O’Brien, Harry
* *weasel* \- Q, Quark

In the words of one alum, *“Star Trek fans love to see the same basic concept tweaked just a little."" \~ Brent Spiner*

**2)** *These shows take advantage of abstraction and analogy to create a unique and meaningful dialogue about normal, human issues.* If you’d like a clear example of this, watch *DS9*’s “The Begotten.” In this episode, Odo, as an ex-shapeshifter, discovers a baby shapeshifter and nurtures it, as if it were his own. After days without progress, the man who discovered and experimented upon Odo insists that nurturing the changeling is not enough, and that discomfort is essential in encouraging the baby to grow at the proper rate. This interesting sci-fi premise is used as an (obvious upon rewatch) metaphor for parental wonders, pressures, and parent-child resentment. *The show provides a new lens through which one can view an existing social dynamic, raising questions in the audience, but rarely giving them absolute answers. The genuine emotional conflict and catharsis that accompanies these discussions make them exceptionally engaging.* (Trek handles analogies like this on an episode-by-episode basis, but a semi-serialized season, when done right, can feature more in-depth explorations of broader themes.)

I opened this essay in noting that I am the youngest Trek fan that I know. Why is that? It’s because ***Star Trek*** **doesn’t stand for anything anymore.** Well, that’s not entirely true. *Star Trek*, to the average person my age, means “J.J. Abrams’ off-brand *Star Wars*.” The fact that this repetitive, hollow imitation of Trek has pushed the 90s shows into obscurity is downright shameful. **The original formula is there, and** ***Trekkies still crave it*****.**

Every time there’s a new Trek show, *we do the same song and dance*, only to meet yet another pointless series of laser battles.

In a world facing COVID, climate change, and bigots of every sort, we need *real inspiration* again. 

In the US, where sociopolitical tensions are at an all time high, as the demographic of disenfranchised youth only grows,

97,The greater villain: Gul Dukat or Khan Noonien Singh?,1597008280,"There was a recent post on r/daystrominstitute making the case that Gul Dukat was the greatest Star Trek villain. I found it a very good argument, but I would say that Khan (particularly in TWOK) has left a more profound legacy. So it got me thinking...

They are both very different antagonists with differing ambitions and goals. Both are morally ambiguous in a sense. Dukat (before the Pah Wraith arc) was very nuanced, multi layered and firmly believes he has conviction in his actions. Singh - depending on your viewpoint - can be identified as having just cause for his actions. As viewers, we can understand their motivations, but conversely they are both very easy to root against. I put this down to compelling performances by the actors as much as storyline.

Both characters are finely acted by Mark Alaimo and the late great Ricardo Montalban. Both characters have great chemistry with other protaganists (Dukat with Sisko, Garek, Kira and Khan with Kirk).

With the serialized nature of DS9, we see a far greater depth and character development with Dukat. He is more layered, subtle, at times vulnerable, a great 3 dimensional character.

Essentially, Khan appeared in one episode of TOS and a movie (two if you include the reboot). He is not as fleshed out as Dukat. Yet the force of personality that Khan has, and Ricardo's stellar performance in TWOK, has elevated him to THE definitive Star Trek villain, of which none have been able to match. IMHO, Soran, Shinzon, The Borg Queen etc have not resonated in the same way. Khan is among the greatest villains in speculative fiction, period. In the 80's and 90's, even outside of the Star Trek fandom (yes I am old enough to remember), people knew or had word the words 'KHAAAAAN'.

Perhaps this isnt a fair comparison on the face of it purely in terms on screen time, but put Dukat in a big budget ST movie and imo he would not have the same effect, likewise if we saw Khan in a serialized story arc he would not have the same impact.

Given temporary command of the *Enterprise* during the brief period (two days or so?) in which the rest of the senior staff and most of the crew are searching a planet's surface for Data, she:

- Builds a working staff of her own from the dregs of newly assigned ensigns and C-list lieutenants left behind to keep the lights on, drawing extraordinary ingenuity and courage out of all of them

- Twice evades an immeasurably superior, faster, essentially undefeatable foe by the barest margins possible

- Evacuates an entire planet's worth of away teams in the space of a few minutes, dumping rematerializing officers into cargo holds and shuttle bays and broom closets for all we know

- When forced to leave 47 of those crew members behind to escape the Borg ship, figures out a way to send a message to Starfleet through a transwarp conduit they didn't even know was a physical possibility a week ago, develops a working rescue plan with her new staff, and returns immediately in spite of having nothing to match the Borg's firepower

- Shunt-stops a Galaxy-class starship out of high warp right on the edge of a planet's atmosphere so she can buy crucial seconds to beam up the rest of the teams, no margin of error whatsoever

- Is able to overclock the *Enterprise*'s shields because she remembered something from one of Geordi's weirder science projects

- Flies the ship into the sun(!)

- Turns the sun into a fucking plasma cannon that she uses to destroy the Borg(!!), fully benefiting from the trust she had placed in the ensign who suggested it

Troi and Riker's son will be born in a year. They and Wesley Crusher would still be aboard the Titan. Picard would likely still be captain of the Ent-E. Since it's animation, the age of the actors doesn't matter. Not to take focus off of Lower Decks itself, but I'd love to see cameos of these characters and/or ships sometime during its run.

12,Star Trek as a stage play,1596998142,"So, there has been a lot of talk about a new Star Trek movie lately and the whole franchise is very diverse in its output; besides the movies there are tv series, books, comics, concerts, fan made stuff, canon, non-canon etc. Of course you know all this.

But what I’ve been wondering lately...

Has there ever been a Star Trek stage play? 

If not, what do you think of a Star Trek stage play? 

This idea popped up, because when I started watching TNG for the first time a couple of months ago I was a bit confused and figuring out what this series was, exactly. Sometimes the scenes on the bridge looked like a stage play, sometimes the close ups of Picard’s face seemed like it was a telenovela in space... Then there was Q... So it was confusing, but also interesting. 

The idea of a stage play keeps creeping up in my head, though.

15,Some questions on TNG Season 5 and Sela,1596995787,"A couple of weeks ago I started watching TNG for the first time and after finishing season 5 I’m wondering why the character of Sela was introduced.

Seems like such a weird and unnecessary decision especially after Yesterday’s Enterprise - Tasha sacrifices herself and her death now has meaning *1.5 seasons later* oh wait nvm, actually she survived, was r**ed by a Romulan and later executed. Sela’s relation to Tasha doesn’t seem to have any significance whatsoever. 
What was the reaction to this plot twist during the show’s initial airing? Is there a reason for this subplot other than “look Denise Crosby’s back!!! and she’s Romulan!!! isn’t that crazy and mysterious?! but who is she?! tune in to season 5 to find out!!”?

A lot of that gets dismissed with a shrug. It's sci-fi. We don't have technology like replicators to make our lives so simple. But we forget that the replicators came long after utopian society was achieved. In fact, they were a byproduct of a society that invested time in scientific research and advancement.

18,Most of the Lower Decks S1:E1 reviews I've seen have really annoyed me...,1596994369,"I'm looking at you Verge, Rolling Stone, and Polygon. These reviews read like people who don't have much interest in what they were assigned to watch or they want something more then what was meant to be offered by this show.

Not every episode of Trek I watch am I looking for some underlying political commentary or dissertation on the plights and pitfalls of modern day society and our own shortcomings in handling them. If that is there, that's great, Trek, and sci-fi in general, has always been a place to freely have those conversations. But there are plenty of times too, I watch to be entertained, and Lower Decks has that in spades.

It was goofy, zany, fast paced, and showed us, arguably, a more human side of Trek than what we've had in the past; but that could be argued for all of the recent offerings (Discovery and Picard in particular.)

I'm sure some people like that and some don't. Trek is nothing without its divided fan base whether it is Prime vs. Kelvin, TOS vs. TNG, Kirk vs. Picard, Data vs. Seven, the list goes on and on.

But my point is, Lower Decks, as I understood the advertising, was meant to be a funny, quirky show, full of nostalgia, about the antics of one of the not-so-much flagship crews of the fleet, and thats ok.

It's for people that want some crazy humor mixed in with their sci-fi, and god bless 'em for that, because if people need anything in this world right now, it's a good laugh.

So when the next episode comes on, kick back, grab some popcorn, let your brain cruise on autopilot for half an hour, and just try to let yourself enjoy a little wackiness that makes you want to throw up your hands when someone yells, ""I got to hold a HEART!"" Love that moment...

And if Mike McMahan happens to read this, for gods sack, I dont care if I have to pause the show, stand upside down and squint until my jaw goes numb to see him, but it will make my later half of 2020 if Rick portals in and out in a handful of frames to steal some dilithium, a warp core, a bat'leth, ANYTHING!!! 🤣

19,Star Trek: Picard and “The Measure of a Man”,1596994228,"           The Measure of a Man is often regarded as one of the more perfect episodes of Star Trek. It has a moral conundrum, a plot that needs Picard to use his skills as a orator and his intelligence to save Data, interpersonal conflict with Riker being the prosecutor. It has everything going for it. 
           As any Star Trek fan would know, Measure of a Man ends with the federation realizing that Data is his own life form, and they, no Bruce Maddox, have the right to use him as a guinea pig, or use androids as slaves. 
          Flash Forward to Picard. Now, androids, just like Data, are used as slaves. The Federation is fine with this, and seemingly so is Picard, as there was no indication that he has any qualms about this, but was focused merely on the Romulans. 
           Why? That’s my only question. This seems like a blatant disregard for one of the best episodes of TNG, so much so that Alex Kurtzman kicks it around with a pair of rattlesnake boots. But not only that, it makes Picard a hypocrite by not doing anything to stop androids from being mass produced as servants. 

Let’s chat about it! Did this bother you? If so, was there anything else in Picard that you thought disregarded the characters or past plots? And If not, tell me why it worked for you! I’m interested in both sides, and MY GOSH, don’t take this as an argument.

74,Warp Field Theory Headcanon; Submitted for Peer Review,1596927804,"AKA the reason most starships have two nacelles with unobstructed line of sight between them, but there are exceptions to both rules. 

What led me to this hypothesis was my knowledge of real-life propeller-driven aircraft; a force commonly referred to as ""p factor"" (or ""left turning forces"" (on planes with only one clockwise-spinning propeller) acts opposite a propeller's spin direction. This force has a variety of causes, for example simple engine torque, blade-tip aerodynamic vortices interacting with the fuselage, and airspeed differences between the ascending and descending blades. On multi engine aircraft, the engines on each wing are often counter-rotated to diminish this effect, and multi-rotor drones take this a step further by using this effect to actually apply flight control on the yaw axis; on a quadcopter usually arranges its motors in diagonal pairs (I.E the front left and back right will be spinning clockwise and the front right and back left counterclockwise) and will accelerate one diagonal pair and decelerate the other in order to make a yaw movement. Applying this to Star Trek warp driven vessels gives us a possible explanation for the commonality-but-not-universality of the two-nacelle line of sight configuration: it's all about gravimetric p factor. We can imagine each warp nacelle having a ""direction of rotation"" related to the distribution of plasma and the spin (and therefor angular momentum) of the resulting particle field. Therefore, single and other odd-number nacelle designs can and do work, but they generate a constant rotational moment that has to be compensated for by additional stabilization technology, and, in reality there are very few drawbacks to simply adding another nacelle, especially since each nacelle isn't actually a separate ""engine"" but rather more of a ""wheel"" deriving power from the same warp core as the other one. As to the issue of line of sight, one could imagine the two counter-rotating graviton fields converging at a point (or rather in a roughly cylindrical region) directly between the nacelles, where the graviton field becomes chaotic, leading to hazardous subspace inertial properties. This leads to the ""Occam's razor"" of starship design being to only have empty space in this region, but if you *do* have a particularly good reason crew and/or hardware should be between the nacelles (such as on the *Defiant*), then there are likely ways around this, for example place liquid storage tanks reinforced by spring baffles in the ""chaos zone"" so that all the unstable graviton field does is cause the liquid to slosh around. This also explains the *Defiant*'s high-warp structural hazards; at high Cochrane levels the ""chaos zone"" becomes more powerful and begins to threaten the structural integrity of the hull.

Oddly, there weren't; not clear ones at least. Even with famously bad seasons, Trek's quality season-by-season isn't that crazy on IMDB (how accurate that is is a different question). There seem to be bigger troughs in places like TNG Season 1 but some of the best season shave the worst episodes.

Such a strong supporting cast.

Also Tasha Yar, can you stop saying rape gangs so much? I got it the first time.

Data is fantastic.

Does Picard always stay kinda awkward? The way he stands sometimes is hilarious.

I get the feeling the doctor doesn't stay for the whole show. Seems expendable and the only actor/actress who takes me out of the future and right back in the 80s with that hair.

Does the show keep it's kinda...mystical element? Like everyone seems chill that Q is an omnipotent being. Or when anything unexplained happens they roll with it.

* Jonathan Archer was originally supposed to be named Jackson Archer, but the name was changed for legal reasons (a public records search revealed there is exactly one real person named Jackson Archer in the United States, and they wanted to avoid any legal accusation that the character was named after the real person.)

A fan since first watching TOS as a kid, yet as life moves on, and the overall quality of television narratives has exponentially improved, why is it that, overall, most fans seems to be mostly satisfied with stories, characters, and concepts that are far below the narrative quality of ""legitimate"" (being very generous with that term) narratives? 

Examples: Mad Men, Watchmen, Stranger Things, etc. 

It is understood that Trek can sometimes rise above the overall quality of the specific series in an individual episode, but the overall quality of every Trek series seems to consist of several clunkers that are almost embarrassingly trite and\\or cliche. 

(Full disclosure: I've watched every Trek series in it's entirety EXCEPT FOR the TOS animated series and Voyager. For those I'm relying on what I've read about them with the understanding I could be WAY off base regarding those series.)

Example: The recent ""Picard"" series. My excitement for the story was significantly diminished by the narrative shortcomings, plot holes, and weak storytelling. 

Please understand; the series was enjoyable and it was fantastic to see these beloved characters again, inhabiting a (mostly) living world and giving us some peek into their post-TNG lives. 

But just imagine what Trek would be like if it approached, equaled, or even exceeded a series like ""The Americans"" or (be still my beating heart!) ""Breaking Bad""?

In all the few movies and series of star trek I ve seen until now, space stations are stationary objects.

82,Lower~~ed expectations~~ Decks,1596826323,"Where to start?  This was hard to get through.  

* The rapid fire dialog is a bad approach.  How many unfunny quips can we force people to listen too?  Apparently, too many and as fast as possible.

* The characters seemed to be churned out by a focus group of boring people who were asked what interesting people might be like.  Which character interests me most?  None, I just watched it and I'm having a hard time remembering who is who.

*  The character design is flat and boring to look at.  The art direction looked like a novice with an iPad just traced vector art out of screen grabs from TNG.  The color pallets were 256 web colors of yawn.  Titmouse can be blamed for this, they've been pretty hit and miss for a while since taking over duties on the Venture Bros.

* It's gags instead of jokes.   It's just a bunch of ""stuff"" that, I guess, we are supposed to laugh at?  Because we already like Star Trek, get it?

* Everything was predictable.  It seems like everything will be predictable from here on out.

* It plays way to safe while trying seem wild.  It smells of desperation.  You can tell the writers were locked into ""canon"" from day one and told not to leave ""canon"" no matter what.  This looks like a case of too many cooks and too few ingredients.

* What was the point of this show?  Who is the audience?  Was there a reason to make this cartoon other than ""we should make a new star trek cartoon.""  I was hoping for a Futurama II or Rick &amp; Morty(ish) adventures but this just lacks any originality or fun.  Instead, this was about as terrible as [Final Space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Space).

* Discovery was a massive disappointment, then Picard literally killed Picard and made him some interstellar problem solving pirate with a makeshift crew (I would take [Ice Pirates](https://youtu.be/uOTgoqy5rO0) as a TV show over Picard), and now this. Set phasers to suicide.

85,Why is there so much hate for Discovery? Here's my experience with the show so far.,1596822346,"Hey everyone.  I just joined the sub and this is my first post, so please forgive me if this has been asked 1000 times.  I just feel like there is a lot of hate for Star Trek Discovery and I don't totally understand why.  Now, I was late to the party when it comes to watching the show.  And initially, I wasn't interested in the show, even though I enjoy Star Trek and consider myself a fan, because I heard it was politically charged and heard complaints about the female lead and just didn't think I'd ever bother watching it.

Late last year, I noticed my local library had seasons 1 and 2 on DVD.  I figured, well why not, I should at least give it a try.  So I checked out season 1.  And I absolutely loved it.  Honestly what really started to draw me in was seeing Michelle Yeoh and Captain Georgiou and Jason Isaacs and Captain Lorca.  I love them as actors and so it really got me interested.  I wasn't totally sure about Burnham initially but I think she's a really interesting character.  And then there's Saru, Tilly, Stamets, Detmer, Tyler, and the list goes on.  And that's just season one.  I'm one disc into season two so far and Pike is just awesome, and seeing Number One brings me back to watching The Cage and the original actress.

I also love the look and feel of the show.  Sure, there are things that are different, like the appearance of the Klingons, but I think that makes the show unique in that regard.  The uniforms are great, even little details like the design pattern consisting of multiple little Star Trek insignias.  The spore drive, the parallel universe, I could go on.  When I get time I'll binge the rest of season 2, but on the whole I love the show so far.

So, can people please help me understand why there seems to be so much hate for this show?  I get that it's different, but every Star Trek series is different to various degrees.  I've heard people basically say that it's not Star Trek and that it's a terrible show.  Are there flaws?  Sure, but nothing's perfect.  But I definitely disagree that it's not Star Trek.

I'm not sure how well portraying the entire ship as being a bit dysfunctional (particularly in the opening sequence) sits it the wider Trek lore. Had it appeared to be operating normally it would have created the impression that jokers like the lower decks guys are to be found throughout starfleet operating out of sight.

1,What's the thinking behind putting Captains in charge of Starships and Commanders in charge of space stations?,1596806830,"Ok the Captains in charge of spaceships part makes sense. I'm accustomed to that.

But consider the comparison to a space station. They're much larger, much more staff to command, many ships coming and going. Many operations to oversee. You'd think each space station would rate a Captain. But as far as I know, only Deep Space Nine does and only because of either the Wormhole or the Defiant. 

I can only guess that while Captains on starships are dealing with smaller operations, they're dealing with more novel, less routine situations, thus you want a higher caliber officer in charge.",startrek,CuriousGazelle0,False,/r/startrek/comments/i5drxe/whats_the_thinking_behind_putting_captains_in/
2,"Does VOY Season 2 Episode 2: ""Initiations"" have implications of pedophilia?",1596805532,"**CW: mention of fictional child abuse, and fictional possibly implied sexual abuse**

I was rewatching Voyager and I got to 02x02 ""Initiations"", when I noticed something I hadn't seen the first time around; it could be interpreted that one of the adult Kazons sexually abused a child. So of course, I dug around on Reddit and Tumblr to see what other people had to say, but I couldn't find anything. So I decided that I would make a post to see if other people have interpreted parts of the episode a similar way I have.

If you don't remember the episode I'm talking about, it starts with Chakotay on the Delta Flyer being hailed by a young adolescent Kazon-Ogla named Kar (played by Aron Eisenberg), who then beams onto the Delta Flyer and &gt;!tries to kill Chakotay, but fails!&lt;. Chakotay hails the Kazon ship Kar came from, and tells them to take Kar back. In doing so, Chakotay describes Kar as looking ""thirteen years old.""

There's a specific scene in which Kar is being scolded by Razik, &gt;!the Kazon-Olga First Mage!&lt;, who is an adult. I unfortunately couldn't find a clip on Youtube, but if you want to watch the scene and you have access to the episode (Netflix, CBS, etc.), **it starts at timestamp 15:10.**

The most notable part of the scene is &gt;!when Razik says he forgives Kar (for failing to kill Chakotay), and Razik kisses Kar on the cheek/jaw. Kar literally says ""please no,"" Razik pulls him to his chest, and Kar cries/whimpers!&lt;. It's real messed up, to say the least. Toward the end of the scene, Razik tells Kar, ""You will eat at my right hand tonight."", like it's some kind of punishment. Not sure if that's an innuendo or not tbh, but that line gives me the squicks. Looking at this scene alone, it seems so incredibly, blindingly obvious to me that Razik is a pedophile, and that the writers intended him to be one.

But then it's crazy, because after that, there's pretty much nothing else in the rest of the episode that would imply *sexual* abuse specifically (at least not that I noticed). Because of that, and because I couldn't find anyone else online who thought the same thing, there is a possibility that I've read too deeply into it, and that while Razik was abusive in lots of other ways, he wasn't sexually abusive. Sometimes I'm really bad at picking up themes/plots in fiction that aren't blatantly stated in dialogue, and sometimes although I know that something is being implied, I misinterpret it.

But I don't know, because that scene seems pretty damn clear cut to me.

So I thought I'd ask if anyone here has felt that way about that episode/that specific scene, or at least sees how it could be interpreted it that way. If you don't think there are any implications that Razik is a sexual abuser, I'm curious as to how you interpret that scene! This is an open discussion and all insights into this episode/scene are welcome. I'm sorry I don't have a link to that scene. If anyone has one, it'd be great if you could share it. Again, the scene starts at the timestamp 15:10 in the episode if you want to check it out.

21,How Many Species Have Never Had a Starfleet Officer?,1596771000,"With the recent inclusion of the first Orion in (prime) Starfleet I started to wonder, how many species are left that have never had an individual in (prime) Starfleet?

By ""species"" I mean ""species with more then one on-screen and physical appearance."" Monsters of the week and that random bloke in the Delta Quadrant aren't interesting. But something like a Yridian with several appearances and no officer (to my knowledge) is at least somewhat unique.

I personally think a species that only appears in name like the Gallamite aren't as interesting as they are scarce enough to have never been seen by any crew with a show. (Yes I know the only Gallamite we know is a Starfleet Captain but shhhh)

I could only think of the Yridians, the Dominion species,  and whatever Morn is. Although the idea of a species of Morn feels... wrong. A Morn is special and precious and should stay unique. And I suppose TECHNICALLY some changelings impersonated Starfleet officers.

There are the Q, but there was that one girl whose parents died to a ""tornado"" and I'm pretty sure she was in some sort of Starfleet program. Same goes for the Prophets and Sisko, but having ""gods"" in starfleet feels odd.

Romulans are also iffy. Tarsis was like 1/8 Romulan and Oh was a spy. Then there was the head of the Tal Shiar who was a spy for the Federation, and the woman on the Deffiant who oversaw the cloak for like 45 minutes, but I think they probably count as there has never been a legitimate officer who identifies as ""Romulan"".

Finally the Xindi do join the Federation and have officers aboard the Enterprise-J. However the sole timeline we know that Enterprise-J existed in cannot exist. The events of Enterprise prevented the timeline with the battle containing the Enterprise-J. (Way to go Daniels, the 31st century must be unrecognizable compared to what it was before the TCW). So unless somebody knows of a Xindi officer outside of Enterprise (which I would love) then they count to.

Can anybody think of another one? I would love to know just how far diverse Starfleet is, and just how far Federation values can reach.

(Incidentally several of these things help them differentiate themselves from Rick and Morty and Final Space in a good way!)

1) Consistent tech and lore!
The technology, ""props"" and aliens all look like they belong in the Star Trek universe! Plus the lore is being pretty well respected!

2) No main character! 
It's nice to not a main character again! 

3) Consistent Characters! (New Characters)
Yes there is only one episode, but by having new characters rather than reusing old ones you don't have to make characters suffer retroactively or act out of character for the sake of drama.

4) A return to Alien of the Week!!!
While story and plot is fine. Star Trek has always been better at ideas, not season long plots. It's much more fun this way!

5) Fun Ideas!
Second Contact! Average Star Fleet Personnel! The Psychologic Trauma of Crazy Star Trek Situations! Sentient caves! The horror of the bureaucracy needed to explain the crazy situations star fleet encounters! All of these are fun and original ideas not explored in past versions of Star Trek! Well done writers!!!

 6) Optimism!
Despite pointing out the flaws in Star Fleet, everything still manages to feel optimistic and not depressing!

7) Good People!
Some of the new shows have tried making their characters ""complex"" by making them do bad things. The problem is this makes them bad people, and bad people are hard to root for! Our new main characters are genuinely good people! They have lots of flaws but they aren't ""morally grey"", they are just chaotic and stupid good, which is refreshing!

8) No saving the universe!
Finally! A new star trek series (and animated sci fi series) where the sake of the Universe (or at least galaxy) isn't at stake!

Flash forward 15 years and I'm teaching high school, sponsoring our school's Tabletop Club (MtG, DnD, Warhammer, etc...) and one of those kids + COVID boredom convinced me to give Star Trek a shot.  My wife and I watched Picard and were in tears almost the entire time, even though we didn't have a particularly strong connection to TNG.

If they followed canon as established in *Balance of Terror*, you'd never see a single Romulan. You'd just hear them over radio.

This would ruin the visual appeal of *Star Trek*. The Romulans would have no faces, and the humans would, which would make the Romulans much harder for the viewers to empathize with. They'd become an unrelatable, stormtrooper-like enemy, and that would undermine the themes of Star Trek.

Of course, they could cut back and forth and show both points of view, but that would undermine the suspense of an invisible enemy.

So if at some point CBS decides to do a Romulan War show, what they should do is have no visuals on either side.

Make it a radio play.

This might seem like a bold move for such a visual genre, yet the Wolverine podcast is doing great.

[**Variety**](https://variety.com/2020/tv/reviews/star-trek-lower-decks-review-1234723948/): ‘Star Trek: Lower Decks’ Expands Gene Roddenberry’s Universe, With Mixed Results: TV Review


&gt; This is a comic universe populated by the slacker Beckett, the rigid Brad, the dreamy D’Vana Tendi (Noël Wells) and the cybernetically-enhanced Sam Rutherford (Eugene Cordero); their adventures have a looseness that can be appealing. And “Star Trek’s” willingness to play with its brand in this way — lending an intellectual property about valiant questing to “Rick and Morty” vet Mike McMahan, to re-engineer as a comedy about the marginal — is admirable. It calls to mind, perhaps, the adventurousness that brought “The Mandalorian” to Disney Plus.


&gt; But the comparison stops there: “The Mandalorian” is aiming to excite, thrill, and enthrall, and “Lower Decks” simply to amuse; it also, in tossing aside the “Trek” earnestness, does somewhat torch that which makes the franchise special in the first place. Its first four episodes contain some laughs and some elegantly done character work. But if the joke of “Lower Decks” is that its characters, on a random ship doing clean-up work somewhere in the galaxy, fall short of demanding a show about their adventures, it’s not hard to agree.

[**The Hollywood Reporter**](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/star-trek-lower-decks-review-1306088): 'Star Trek: Lower Decks': TV Review

&gt; What stands out early on in Lower Decks, and never ceases to be the case in the four episodes made available to critics, is how few actual punchlines there are in the series. Instead, Lower Decks places references where gags ought to be and assumes that you'll find it uproarious that the characters here like talking about Captain Kirk or making the Vulcan salute.

&gt; The references are unquestionably tiered. Everybody can get a Captain Kirk reference. Any dedicated Star Trek fan will get a Captain Janeway or Miles O'Brien reference. And, again, they're just references. We're not talking deep-dive punchlines related to a thing Captain Janeway did in that one episode of Voyager. But maybe you actually need a certain obsessiveness to know different types of Klingon cuisine or to laugh at a hastily delivered line about the Khitomer Accords, an opportunity that you have to take advantage of quickly because most references, once dropped, are never picked up again. I promise you that I don't get all the references in Star Trek: Lower Decks, so there's at least the chance that I'm missing all the best bits.


&gt; Take away the references and you're left with little by way of narrative, since the episodic incidents are, because of the very nature of the series' focus, largely disposable. It takes a lot to render a zombie virus or a giant man-sucking spider forgettable or secondary, but Lower Decks does just that, somewhat by design I'm guessing. What's missing are the big intellectual or formal swings McMahan has taken in his past efforts in the science fiction space, or anything resembling the timeliness and allegory that the original Star Trek and the best of its offshoots have exhibited. Such aims are lost in Brad and Beckett's simplistic weekly back-and-forth bickering about the importance of following rules or breaking them, which is just not entertaining.

&gt; The show's at its strongest when it sticks most closely to its premise: background Trek characters going about their days, intersecting with the glamorous bridge crew only glancingly, if at all. But over the course of the first four episodes made available to press, our four Ensigns keep encountering the ship's steely captain (voiced by Dawnn Lewis) a ridiculously square-jawed first officer (voiced by Jerry O'Connell) more and more frequently, enmeshing themselves in command decisions.


&gt; There's also, at least in the early going, a tendency for the in-jokes to tread ground that many stylish Trek and Trek-adjacent black booties have trod repeatedly by now — the holodeck has prurient possibilities! etc. etc. — which is something the show's going to want to keep an eye on, if the idea is to boldly joke where no one has joked before.




[**Trekmovie**](https://trekmovie.com/2020/08/06/review-star-trek-lower-decks-goes-for-the-laughs-and-finds-the-heart-in-second-contact/): Review: ‘Star Trek: Lower Decks’ Goes For The Laughs, And Finds The Heart In “Second Contact”



&gt; Some may think that there isn’t room in Star Trek for a comedy, but humor has always been an element of the franchise, going back to The Original Series. And for those that can find room in their beating fan hearts for an adult animated comedy, the reward will be some impassioned Star Trek. Lower Decks is clearly made by people who love the franchise as much as any fan engrossed in the details of starship nacelles or the history of the Beta Quadrant.


&gt; A lot of attention to detail has been made to fit Lower Decks into the TNG era. The show is made to be part of the canon of Star Trek, and the creative team for this comedy are taking that very seriously. Inside and out, the USS Cerritos fits the part as a ship dedicated to the less-glamorous task of second contact, and the crew manifests the diversity that makes up the United Federation of Planets. Even in their cartoon forms, the Vulcans, Andorians, Benzites, and others are all recognizable. The episode is also worth a re-watch, as there are lots of little Trek details and gags you may not even notice your first time through.

&gt; Even the crisis-of-the-week with the crew being taken over by an alien virus feels straight out of the Trek trope handbook. While it might have been a bit clichéd as the plot of a live-action drama, it worked perfectly as the B-story for an animated comedy focused on the ensigns.


[**Collider**](https://collider.com/star-trek-lower-decks-review-cbs-all-access/): ‘Star Trek: Lower Decks’ Brings the Funny Without Forgetting the ‘Trek’ — Review

&gt; The clean animation style keeps the action relatively grounded — certainly, the show adheres to modern rules of physics, not Looney Tunes physics, with no touches of the grittier style that Star Trek: Discovery often adopts. The four episodes provided to critics also stand out in contrast to modern television by virtue of the fact that they’re all pretty stand-alone adventures; perhaps a more fleshed-out connective thread will emerge by the end of the season, but in the meantime, there’s something to be said for concise storytelling. Also, there’s the occasional moment of rude humor, but by and large Lower Decks would make for completely acceptable family viewing — especially for a family where Trek is already one of the shows everyone can agree on.


&gt; Not every joke lands perfectly, but so much of Lower Decks‘ humor is impressively well-calibrated to celebrate this franchise for its quirks, while also poking fun at concepts that are relatable no matter the century, like boring business meetings, professional jealousies, and awkward first dates. It’s not easy, trying to find a new way to sing Star Trek‘s song, but so far Lower Decks has found a way to nimbly balance some tricky concepts and look good doing it. The U.S.S.

Getting to the point: even if you haven't seen the first episode yet, it is clear from the trailer that Mariner is a very 'in your face' type of person. Unfortunately, she is also very 'touchy'; always putting her hands on her crewmates (even getting drunk an injuring them).

As I watched, I couldn't help but feel how extremely inappropriate this would feel if it were a male character being so 'touchy' with female crew members. And the fact is, inappropriate behavior is wrong regardless of which 'direction' it's coming from.

88,Why Season 3 of Enterprise is the best season of Star Trek,1596721809,"I've been seeing a lot of love for Enterprise lately, and I wanted to join in on the fun. Enterprise is currently tied with Voyager as my favorite show and I adore them both. Enterprise was my very first Star Trek show, actually, which I binged after I got interested in Star Trek as a result of watching Star Trek Into Darkness. Why did I watch Enterprise first you may ask? Well, firstly because I love chronological orders, and secondly, because the premise of Enterprise interested me the most. I though it would be really amusing to learn about the universe at the same time the characters are learning about it. Now, onto the main topic.

Why is Season 3 of Enterprise the best season of Star Trek?

In a nutshell, because **it's TNG, DS9, and Voyager all rolled up in one neat package**. And that's an amazing combination, an combination massively strengthened by the fact that Season 4 follows up on the events of Season 3 and explores how they impacted the characters and the world.

**The Premise**

Let's talk about what Season 3 of Enterprise is about. For the first two seasons, the crew of the Enterprise is running around the neighborhood making mistakes, causing diplomatic incidents, fighting with hostile aliens, but also frequently making friends and even allies, while strengthening the position of Earth in the Alpha Quadrant. But the it all ends with a rude awakening. A mysterious threat from beyond the stars, an unknown race known only as the Xindi, have launched a devastating attack against Earth. Millions are dead, including some people close to our crew members. Tensions are inflamed immediately, and it is revealed that the only way to reach the Xindi is to go into the Delphic Expanse. A completely unexplored region of space marred by spatial anomalies and other forms of extremely weird and unnatural phenomena. The main bad guys up until now, the reclusive and suspicious enemy force from the future and his present day alien accomplices, have suddenly turned helpful. What could possibly be so bad that would force them to start helping the heroes? The Enterprise is then sent straight into the Expanse to deal with the threat.

**The Plot**

Enterprise barges into the Delphic Expanse, in a characteristic, brash human fashion that we've grown accustomed too. It's a recurring plot point in Enterprise that Humans are far less cautious and restrained than Vulcans, and this frequently gets them in trouble. Driven by the horrors of the Xindi attack, Archer and Tucker have practically embraced militarism and xenophobia. They even have a squad of soldiers on board now. They have resolved to do whatever it takes to defeat the Xindi, and they will do ""what needs to be done"".

The are now however completely isolated from everything they know, in region of space completely hostile to all outsiders. And they quickly come to the realization they will have to bend and perhaps compromise their morality if they intend to survive and save Earth from annihilation. Over the course of the season, they are heavily challenged, both individually, and as a crew, but the season isn't fully serialized. There is a single overarching plot, but each episode is still independent and tells its own story. This is in my opinion far better than what shows like Picard do, where there really are no episodes, just a 10 hour movie split up into chunks. This is where Enterprise brilliantly mixes Voyager and DS9. DS9 was primarily about a war of survival against a hostile alien race, while Voyager was primarily about surviving and thriving in thousands of light years away from Earth and everything they knew. Enterprise was all alone in the Expanse, and yet they had to carry the burden of determining the entire fate of Human race. However, something amazing happens. 

Our expectations are entirely subverted when it turns out that the Xindi are not at all a one dimensional boogeyman the crew thought they were. No, they are actually quite like us Humans! They too want to survive and thrive in a hostile galaxy, and they too were led out of a destructive internal war by a seemingly benevolent race of alien saviors. But they were deceived. Everything hinges on that fact, and everything hinged on Archer and his crew working past their hatred and xenophobia. And they managed to do it! After coming down to their lowest point, when the Enterprise was practically turned into a floating wreck, the crew managed to do it. They teamed up with the same guy who invented the Xindi weapon, they made an alliance with the Xindi, and they saved both species from extinction. It was such a brilliant turn which represents everything Star Trek is about.

**The Aftermath**

Unlike DS9 and Voyager, which both end after their climaxes, Enterprise goes on past Season 3, which allows the show to explore how all the events depicted in the season impacted the characters, Starfleet, and the setting. The most stunning impact is on Archer and T'Pol. Archer is practically a different man now. He is haunted by everything that happened in the Expanse, he is questioning his own decisions, and he cannot accept the bad things he did. 

He saved the day in the end, but at what cost? Were the Vulcans right after all? We also learn that Archer was the one who originally insisted that the Enterprise be lightly armed, a decision which would leave the Enterprise far too weak in many crucial encounters. He gets into arguments with Captain Hernandez, a woman who was once his lover and subordinate. She is about to captain the NX-02, the Columbia, which has been upgraded and refitted according to many of Archer's suggestions. She is really green and eager, but Archer is jaded and a bit cynical. Their discussions help Archer find some peace and purpose, and he would later go on to spearhead the events which would later lead to the formation of the Federation. Here, Archer reclaims much of his original idealistic spirit, and the connections and allies made over the past seasons finally come into play.

Social consequences of the Xindi attack are explored too, as many people embrace racism and xenophobia, and this culminates in episode Terra Prime (which is the *real* finale of Enterprise), when Archer and the crew must finally deal with the shadows of Humanity's backwards past so that a new world might finally be born. It's an uncertain future, but we will take the plunge. A dream that became a reality and spread throughout the stars. That is the Federation. Well, it was a dream that was brought about by Archer and his crew, after they faced some of the greatest challenges any crew could ever face.

**Conclusion**

It was a non-stop action movie where every scene is people yelling at each other. I know it's a common thing to point out, but the shakycam and lens flares really bugged me.

**LD** | E01


___

**Episode 1 - ""Second Contact""**

* Boimler's log establishes the stardate as 57436.2. This translates to approximately the year 2380, which is one year after the events of *Nemesis*, two years after the end of VOY, five years after the end of DS9 and seven years before the Romulan supernova seen in *Star Trek 2009.* The series thus continues the ""TNG era"" of Star Trek which aired between 1987 and 2002.
* Douglas Station is a ""Spacedock""-style starbase modeled after the Earth station seen in the TOS films.
* The *Cerritos* is reported to be a California-class starship, not previously seen in the franchise. It features a discontinuous hull similar to the design of other classes like the Oberth, and its contours and palette are evocative of Starfleet vessels of the TNG era. Fans have described it as a potential ""kitbash"" where pieces of multiple existing ships are slapped together, which if intentional would speak to its generic demeanor and mission. The ship is presumably named after the city of Cerritos, California, which judging from its wikipedia page is appropriately unremarkable.
* The bridge includes background stations marked ""Engineering II,"" ""Mission Ops"" and ""Engineering,"" as was seen on the bridge of the *Enterprise-D* and *Voyager.* The computer interface is the TNG-era LCARS operating system.
* First contact is the diplomatic function of establishing relations with a new species or civilization, sometimes one which has just developed warp drive. The ceremonial aspects were explored in the TNG episode of the same name. The most famous First Contact was between the Vulcans and Humans in 2063, depicted in the TNG film of the same name. ""Second contact"" is an idea new to canon.
* The Starfleet uniforms seen here are evocative of the TNG uniforms of the 2360s but feature a colored stripe such as those seen in the 2387 flashback scenes in PIC, plus a fold-over tunic style seen in dress uniforms.
* Mariner is drinking ""Romulan whiskey."" We've previously seen Romulan ale throughout the franchise, which is also blue, and also illegal.
* Mariner's Klingon sword is a bat'leth, first seen in TNG. She claims to have obtained it from ""an old guy with an eye patch,"" which is potentially a reference to General Chang (who of course is long dead) or Chancellor Martok. Previews for upcoming episodes also include a Klingon with an eye patch. The subtitles claim Boimler is screaming ""Worf Worf Worf"" as Mariner attacks him; I'm not sure why he would say this in context but I'm not sure what else he'd be saying.
* The opening titles are somewhat of a parody of the VOY opening titles, featuring flybys of various space phenomena but with the ship running into them. The Romulan-Borg battle is the first battle sequence shown in a Star Trek credits sequence. The font for the titles is that of the TNG credits.
* The shuttlecraft don't exactly match any particular shuttle class seen before but bear resemblance to Type 6 (TNG), Type 8 (VOY) and Type 11 (*Insurrection*) shuttles, as well as runabouts. They bear the names of national parks in California: Redwood, Joshua Tree, Yosemite, and Death Valley; Deep Space Nine's shuttles were all named after Earth rivers.
* Tendi is an Orion, one of the first aliens depicted in the franchise. Orions are green, maintain a dubious commercial/privateering/piracy network, and have complicated gender roles. I believe the only other Orion seen in Starfleet was Uhura's friend in *Star Trek 2009.*
* Other new recruits include a Klingon and a Benzite, the blue catfish-like fellows first seen in ""Coming of Age.""
* Tendi's round duffel bag is a commonly-seen design first introduced in TNG.
* The voice of the computer is not that of Majel Barrett, a first for the TNG era.
* Food replicators are one of the many things shown to break down on starships and space stations.
* There are a handful of various tools and doohickeys strewn about the maintenance bay which resemble the generic tool props seen in other series.
* The map of the *Cerritos* appears to show about eleven decks in the saucer section.
* Rutherford is, I think, the first person in Trek to actually be described as a ""cyborg."" The description also fits Airiam, as well as, briefly, Vedek Bareil. Oh, and, you know, those bad guys from TNG and VOY. The, um...Cylons or whatever they were.
* During the tour, Mariner waves off most of the rooms saying ""no one knows what that is"" while Boimler attempts to explain the uninteresting things they actually are. This is a nod to the door labels on starship locations which do indeed seem nondescript and only there to take up space.
* A Vulcan is seen in the lower deck crew quarters. Other Vulcans are seen later in the episode.
* Boimler references sonic showers, often referenced, seldom seen and never explained.
* Boimler then references ""cetacean ops,"" a mysterious part of the *Enterprise-D* which is also never explained but is theorized in non-canon to house whales and dolphins (the latter being mentioned once in TNG) who help with celestial navigation.
* The holodeck is the same design seen in TNG. *Voyager* and the *Enterprise-E* had a different design, suggesting that the *Cerritos* is an older ship.
* The holodeck makes the same ""acknowledged"" chirpy noises that the one on TNG made.
* Boimler's aversion to sand is a reference to a villain in old American mythology.
* One of the away team members is a Bolian, the most famous of whom was Mot the barber.
* The transporter sounds are taken from TNG. The visual effect is somewhat different.
* Among the artifacts in the captain's ready room is a California flag. I think this is the first state flag to be seen in Star Trek.
* The other artifacts don't seem to be easter eggs, but there is a baseball, something that Ben Sisko always kept in his own ready room.
* Barnes is a Trill, a joined species primarily represented through Jadzia and Ezri Dax.
* Also in the bar is an Andorian, the blue antenna-sporting guys from TOS and ENT.
* One of the members of the lower decks away team is wearing a VISOR like that of Geordi La Forge.
* Billups wants them to set up a subspace whatever so the Galardonians can communicate with ""the rest of the Federation."" This implies that the Galardonians *immediately* joined the Federation after first contact, a process which would seem to at *least* require a second contact beforehand. Maybe this is the ""Live Fast and Prosper"" method of membership.
* Although there have been allegories in the past, this episode depicts Trek's first full-fledged zombie outbreak.
* The phasers are the Type II design seen in TNG.
* A background woman in the bar during the initial outbreak is *also* wearing a VISOR.
* Mariner absconds with a Starfleet dune buggy. This vehicle was first seen in *Nemesis* as the totally-necessary and not-at-all-ridiculous *Argo.*
* Doctor T'Ana is a Caitian, a species first introduced in Trek's other animated series...*The Animated Series.* I suppose we should start calling it *The Original Animated Series.*
* The shovel and hoe evoke a tool design seen before in TNG, although I don't recall precisely where.
* Mariner mentions once being trapped in a Klingon prison. The prison planet Rura Penthe was visited by both Kirk and Archer (and Nero, in a deleted scene); neither had to fight a Yeti, though Kirk had run-ins with other large brutes.
* I believe this is the first time someone in Star Trek has been called a ""dick.""
* The communicator badges make the same chirpy sound as in TNG.
* Rutherford and Barnes spacewalk on the exterior of the ship. EVAs have been seen before, most famously in *First Contact.* The suit design is most similar to the suits in that film and in VOY.
* This is the first reference to The Monkees in Star Trek, although the character of Pavel Chekov was partially created to appeal to the ""Davy Jones"" teen set.
* The ""you can't do that"" error noise is from TNG.
* Lieutenant Shaxs is a Bajoran, the religious/artistic/oppressed people who were the focus of DS9.
* The hypospray effect is the same as TNG.
* Mariner calls Boimler her ""cha'DIch."" A cha'DIch is an advocate who serves to representative a challenger to Klingon law. So...I don't really think the name *fits* here, but...canon reference.
* Mariner then name-drops
 * Spock, the Vulcan first officer in TOS, and his later death and exploits fighting Khan and ""space whales"" (*The Voyage Home*)
 * Sulu, the TOS helmsman, who fought with a sword once when everyone was drunk
 * Kirk, the legendary captain of the original *Enterprise*
 * Worf, the Klingon security chief of TNG and DS9
 * Gary Mitchell, Kirk's old Academy buddy who had a high esper rating but couldn't remember middle initials
 * Deanna Troi, TNG's ship's counselor
* The *Cerritos* makes the familiar flashy effect as it warps away.",startrek,Antithesys,False,/r/startrek/comments/i4qvnh/canon_references_second_contact_spoilers/

30,"I’m going to tell you which series is the Best, and why: a review of the shows leading up to LDS",1596677306,"We’re one day away from the latest iteration of Star Trek and in a time honoured tradition, I’m going to tell you how I feel about each series.


Star Trek:

TOS is clearly the best series. Why? It’s right there in it’s title: it’s the Original. TV was coming to maturity and Star Trek arrived with its progressive message, inspiring adventures and intriguing characters. The dynamic of Kirk, Spock and McCoy, and it’s allegory for the human condition crystallized the American zeitgeist and offered the world a future you wanted to live in. Every episode was a new take on modern issues through the buck Rogers lens, a philosophical exploration in pop culture, a stark contrast to the shallow lost in space, and a coherent message against the scattershot episodes of the Twilight Zone and the Outer Limits.

It broke barriers and offered a future free of prejudice, where the only hardship was self improvement and the desire to boldly go where no one had gone before.


TOS is the best series because it defines everything that followed, and was such a starkly original synthesis of Space Opera and Philosophy is the giant upon whose shoulders all other film and tv sci fi stands. No other show shook the foundations of story telling like it did.

The Animated Series:

TAS is the best series, because it wasn’t shackled by sound stages and the Vasquez Rocks. Bold Alien designs, amazing technologies like the Rec Room (see: Holodeck) and personal shields, and bizarre planets and alien ships made the universe feel that much larger than the live show ever could.

It gave us definitive moments in Spock’s life, put Uhura in command of the Enterprise and defined the “classic” crew members like Sulu, Chekov, Uhura and Scotty in a way the live action show never did.

It was a labour of love, with episodes written by cast members and DC Fontana at the helm. It defined what TNG would become, a broader focus where the crew weren’t just minor characters, but essential to the ship and showed us the potential of the setting.

The Next Generation:

TNG is the best series, because it defined what Star Trek is. It took the concept of TOS and graduated it from a bizarre cult phenomena into a mainstream entity. It ran for only seven seasons,  but in hindsight, it probably could have had the legs of something like Stargate, if it wanted. It left on top, with one of the greatest series finales in television history, genre fiction or not.

Is there a better character in Trek than Data? Is there a crew more emblematic of the message of diversity in the face of adversity? TNG dominates best episode lists for a good reason: it’s the best.

TNG eschewed the cowboy justice of TOS for a more rational, measured approach to problem solving. The crew had a voice and cooperated, teaching us that intelligence and empathy overcome traditional irrationally and hatred.

TNG defined the spark of TOS and made it a mature, consistent drama, rather than a brief spark. It was Help, Rubber Soul and Sgt. Peppers if Trek were the Beatles: still Rock and Roll, but something more.

It was a TV phenomenon that defined what science fiction on TV would be. It was the first in an onslaught of pretenders,  none who captured the place in culture it holds, and none who spoke so clearly.

Deep Space 9:

DS9 is the best series because it transcended the teenage philosophy of its predecessors and told stories that had consequences. No reset button, no magic solution that wrapped things up with a bow: DS9 showed us a real world instead of an implausible utopia.

DS9 was full of real people, with real struggles, but it never lost the optimism that defined Trek. It was a mature discussion of how that optimism could work, of how it could be implemented in the face of bigotry and violence.

DS9 pushed the edges of storytelling, daring to be serialized in an era that still clung to happy endings and the status quo. It offered us a Black Captain, strong female characters, who weren’t defined by female tropes like mother, lover or rape survivor, and gender fluid characters. And they actually explored what they meant. They weren’t a token, they had a story that related to that part of their personality, and didn’t relegate them to side characters who weren’t allowed to transgress cultural norms.

DS9 wasn’t afraid to interrogate itself, to question assumptions of what utopia is, and to give credible voices in support and defense. It gave us a real dialogue about where we were going, and whether we wanted it.

It was a mature storytelling, well beyond the simplistic moralizing that came before.

Voyager:

Voyager was the best series because it took the Rockwell perfection of TNG and put real people, with flaws and merits in the place of rosy perfect paragons. It told clear, coherent stories that carried a message that didn’t bludgeon you.

It gave us women who weren’t defined by their relationships, men who expressed themselves outside of machismo acts of physical prowess and sexual dominance, and made the ship feel like a real community of many cultures.

It taught us how important a moral compass was, and how to preserve its integrity in the face of adversity. It didn’t rely on violence and war to tell compelling stories, and emphasized exploration and making friends in your journey in a way no series had before.

It was a maturation of the original series, a proof of concept of the unity and cooperation of a fully developed crew and meeting adventure with an open mind and a desire for knowledge.

It refused to surrender to darkness, and remained a beacon of hope in a world leaving the optimism of the fall of the Soviet Union and entering the age of terrorism. 

Enterprise:

Enterprise is the best series, because it showed us how much we were capable of.

This isn’t some distant future, with perfect people who attained perfection without explanation, these were the children of the apocalypse, deciding to look outward rather than inward. Curiosity and Exploration, embodied as a virtue.

Enterprise showed us a roadmap for the future, the struggle of finding common ground without surrendering what makes us unique. That conflict of selves that requires an iron will but doesn’t require violence: rationality, openness and patience will overcome the difference and arrive at a new synthesis.

It wasn’t preaching from perfect people, it was real people, behaving in admirable ways, a true paragon of where we can go

Discovery:

Discovery is the best show, because it teaches us how to keep our self in the midst of darkness. In a world where it can be so easy to compromise your values, to follow a crowd of people who aren’t looking out for your best interests, where violence is such an easy solution, Discovery tells us to stay true to the message of hope. Of the strength of a diverse group united overcoming adversity. 

It warns us about the dangers of surrendering agency to authority without questioning it. That freedom requires dialogue and questioning authority. 

It gives a diverse crew effortlessly, a variety of problems that put us in the shadows, then show us the light. It isn’t afraid of giving us ugliness, of sanitizing reality, but it always shows us a path to the light.

Discovery is the best show because it emphasizes free will more than any Trek before it.

Picard:

Picard is the best series because it’s willing to tell us that failure isn’t permanent. That no one is perfect. That the essence of humanity isn’t succeeding, it’s persevering in the face of failure.

The characters of Picard are far more human than any we’ve seen in Star Trek. They are fuck ups and failures, struggling to cope with the weight of the world. And in the face of all this, they still prove to be excellent.

They refuse to give up, they learn from their mistakes and they push past the anxiety and the pain and help other people. 

Picard teaches us that no mistake is permanent and forgiveness and redemption are quintessential to the human condition, with a depth no other series approaches. 

Humanity is flawed, but those flaws are the keys to our success.

The Lower Decks:

The Lower Decks are the best because the Cerritos is pure ship porn and the sexiest ship since the Enterprise A: Fite me!

35,Why Star Trek: Enterprise is a Great Series,1596673389,"While I'm not as much of a hard-core Treky as some people here, I grew up on Star Trek. I'm 17 now, and from a very early age, Star Trek has been a huge part of my life and development. I was a pretty mature kid, and that's my Mom's fault, because she had me hooked on Sci-Fi as soon as I watched Anakin Skywalker's melting body crawl from lava at age 3. Star Trek was a huge influence on me as a kid, and the various series really inspired me. By the time I was sixteen, I had seen all of the series, and all of the episodes. (at least those available on Netflix)

Except Enterprise.

Why? Because I was told Enterprise sucked. When I finally grudgingly convinced myself to watch it, I was in that mood where one tries to find everything wrong with the show. ""That's not right!"" ""That's dumb."" ""That episode sucked."" Working so hard to nitpick the show. But within the first few episodes, those preconceptions faded (after all, that's what Star Trek is all about - no more preconceptions! lol) and I grew to love the show.

**The Premise**

People have a lot of disdain for prequels in general. I've never understood this. Sure, I knew Enterprise would *have* to end with the foundation of the Federation, because, duh. But I was quickly sold on how much of an adventure that could be. Just because you spoil the end doesn't mean the journey means nothing.

The Federation, before it was founded, was a *radical* idea! All these conflicting species, working together as one? Getting the insanity of the Federation to actually work is worthy of its own adventure.

TOS (and Discovery, in between the two) just force the viewer to accept the current state of galactic affairs. This isn't a criticism, it's just incomplete. Enterprise filled in an important gap.

**The Plot**

Early Enterprise was rough. They wanted to do the dumbass Time War, which made me think of that song every time they mentioned it and made things hard to take seriously. The Time War would likely be used as a ploy to cram in as many references to TOS, TNG, and DS9 as possible. It's the perfect plot to guzzle fan service.

But then, by Season 2, the show realized it was good enough to stand on its own two legs. The cast didn't need to lean on fan service to drive home an impact. (Discovery, lol) The Enterprise NX-01 had plenty of new things to explore and discover, without needing to travel far into the future.

Most importantly, Enterprise proved that Star Trek could evolve to survive. Prior to Enterprise, Star Trek strictly followed the ""villain of the week"" format. An adventure took one hour and one hour only. This format was popular until streaming services destroyed it, rendering shows like TNG non-viable if they aired today. The death of the week-by-week format could easily have been the death of Star Trek, since it so heavily relied on that medium. But the long-term harrowing plot of Enterprise allowed the franchise to be updated into a modern context - it proved that Star Trek could keep going, boldly.

Further, Star Trek has always been topical. The Xindi weapon was of course an allegory to the 9/11 attacks, and Captain Archer's actions emulated America's response. Throughout the show, Starfleet made mistakes in their crusade for justice, demonstrating a dark nuance that had only been touched on in the other shows. Morales were twisted and rules bend. Bottom Line: Starfleet was allowed to make mistakes but still served as a beacon of hope and optimism.

**The Characters**

Lots of people hate the Enterprise characters. Here's why I love them.

Newsflash everybody, culture changes! Lol. But seriously, by the 24th century, it's reasonable to assume that mannerisms &amp; pleasantries would change from their modern ways. Starfleet officers of TOS, TNG, DS9, and Voyager are all loveable and rightfully so. But, they demonstrate what I believe to be Gene Roddenberry's vision for a ""future culture."" A culture that is reserved, intellectual, and proper. Even Kirk, the jaunty space-cowboy, speaks and moves with military precision. Riker can be horny at times, but generally maintains that same clean &amp; proper Starfleet feel. Hell, let's take a look at the costumes and sets! Starfleet society clearly values a clean and crisp starship.

But not Enterprise! The people in Enterprise act much more like 21st century humans. Maybe it's the hat, but I would not be at all weirded out in a conversation with Archer. And I'd love to hang out with Trip. If I spoke with anyone else in the franchise, I'd likely be a bit weirded out by that laminated feeling.

This down-to-earth-quality makes the characters relatable to me. I feel more comfortable with them. And, to some degree, I feel like they don't know what they're doing in space but living it up anyways. Unlike any other characters, they're not larger than life.

**Conclusion**

Currently, Enterprise is tied with DS9 for #1 in my rankings of Star Trek series. TOS isn't included in that list, because I feel like its own animal, and deserves to be excluded from the ranking because its beauty comes in different forms. If you guys appreciate this post, I'd be happy to give a follow-up regarding DS9.",startrek,ultrawesley456,False,/r/startrek/comments/i4hblq/why_star_trek_enterprise_is_a_great_series/

""You've failed as a trekkie"" ""no trekkie worth anything would enjoy that flop of a timeline"" ""and anyone who likes it is an improper trekkie""

Just stop this in general. Just say ""I personally don't enjoy it, I'd like to stick to my prime timeline, but I'm certainly glad you enjoy it!"" It's so easy to be a considerate human being.

Watching the episode Dear Doctor, Dr. Phlox is trying to help a population that has gotten sick. The planet has two sentient humanoid species on it, something fairly uncommon. Phlox realizes that what is ailing the more dominant species is a genetic disorder, and though he does have a cure, he refuses to share it since he believes that he would be messing with the natural evolution of the planet. 

This is supposed to represent a difficult situation that the Prime Directive would have aided them in. 

However, I can't help but find fault in the moral logic of the episode. Phlox says that he doesn't want to play God by helping these people, but he's also playing God by refusing to help them. 

It seems to me that Phlox would have given the cure if there was only one humanoid species on the planet. Instead of giving both species the opportunity to continue thriving together, he chooses one species over the other. (I know that he doesn't see it that way, but it's effectively what he's doing.) 

I'm not convinced that the Prime Directive would have prohibited Starfleet from helping out as well.

Idea that if Russia is not communist (because Lenin died early) Hitler will leave it alone is dumb. Hitler's ideology was based on race and he hated slavs, not to mention wanting ""living space"" from the east.  So I am not convinced Hitler would ignore Russia if Bolsheviks never gained power.

Also idea that Hitler could invade UK and eastern USA if he focused on them early is fucking stupid. There is no way he could invade UK and it is easier to go warp 10 than to Germany to invade USA in ww2.

Battle of Britain already showed that Germany did not have the navy to invade UK and failed to destroy RAF even when they were focusing on them. Also we can expect that USA joins war early so Germany maybe faced  both UK and USA navies at the same time. 

Even if they somehow won against UK, Germany cannot invade USA, no matter how much they focus on them. Germany could not support their troops with supplies and even less cover the actual naval landings from USA navy and airforce.

72,“Yesteryear” - First Time Viewing Reaction,1596624263,"Noob Trek 81 - Yesteryear

Isn’t this opening theme also used at Miss America pageants?

Oh, DC Fontana, I remember her from TOS, she was good. I didn’t pay attention to who wrote the previous episode but it’s cool if the writers have carried over from TOS.

The time vortex planet looks cool. Oh look, it’s the gate from City On The Edge Of Tomorrow! The new voice sucks though. It’s good that the federation is revisiting it, it seems so bizarre to discover technology as amazing as that and just forget about it and OH MY GOD WHAT IS THAT THING? BEGONE FOUL TWISTED BIRD DEMON. I still remember Sulu’s bizarre co-pilot from last episode. Is introducing outre species we never see again going to be a thing with TAS?

Wait, what, Kirk and Spock’s journey into the past has just FINISHED as we arrive? That’s bit of a gyp, I wanted to see that adventure.

I wasn’t feeling too good about this at the opening. Camera is moving around oddly, character movement is inappropriate, flat voice acting, suddenly no one knows who Spock is, I’m a bit lost. The pacing is off, it feels airless. And given that we have no idea what Kirk and Spock changed in the vortex, I feel little connection to the new timeline. There‘s also a weak link in the voice acting and it’s Kelley. Good as he was on the live-action show, Kelley is letting the side down with his consistently casual line readings.

An Andorian first officer? What? Oh, Spock and Kirk have accidentally come to another timeline. They do something interesting with Thelin, and that’s to not make him a villain. He gets red herringed with multiple shots of his Scooby Doo villain eyes, but he turns out to just be a regular guy doing his job. And if I suspected him of foul play because he is an Andorian, a race previously portrayed as psychotic, it’s an ironic example of the racial prejudice that will affect Spock during the flashback.

I’ve just realised the artists have made the amateurish mistake of not contouring the clothes over the characters figures. This gives the impression that they‘re naked and wearing body paint rather than uniforms. Subsequently many of scenes can become nightmarish. That guy who calls Kirk in the briefing room is beyond depressed. Mind you I wouldn’t feel great about having to gaze upon Shatner’s nude, body-painted torso either.

Vulcan reaction to his mother’s death is so minimal it is almost amusing. See also later Salek noting his son has likely been abducted with all the emotion of someone remarking that it’s raining. However, these events become recontextualised when Spock notes that it is not that Vulcan’s do not possess this emotions, but rather that they control them. They still feel. I mean if your kid was abducted you might want to faint and run adound screaming and punching holes in things, become violent, demand of the sky that your be kid be returned etc, but what results would spending precious minutes doing those things garner? Keeping a level head is much more likely to secure a positive outcome.

If you forgive the cod science, explanation of what has caused the time distortion is sort of creative, how Spock was in the past of Orion while the past of Vulcan was played out, meaning he could not rescue himself. Wait a minute, is this actually cool or does it really not make much sense? I have a feeling this plot will shatter into pieces if I think about it too hard, but I won’t do that because it’s irrelevant to the real point/themes of the episode. However if the guardian can change history like this it’s absurdly powerful, and the federation could do all sorts of things such as “accidentally“ push a nuclear bomb through the portal onto a prehistoric Klingon.

I’m delighted that we’re going to get such an extended look at Vulcan, and also that Kirk \*doesn’t\* come along as I feared he might. I have nothing against Kirk but that would really detract from what makes this episode special - it’s Spock’s story and it’s about the Vulcan culture and making it about Kirk’s heroics would undermine all of that.

It’s neat to hear actual kids voices being used rather than the usual adult-impersonating-child stuff, and it’s a boldly frank look at racial bullying that they're doing too. Already the episode is leaving it’s dicey opening behind and entering more mature, intriguing waters. The sense of delight continues when I realise that Mark Lenard has been retained as Sarek. He does a wonderful job too - it would be easy for his lack of reaction to his son being bullied or possibly abducted to come off as comical, but Lenard makes the characterisation work, holding true to Spock’s statement that it is not that Sarek is emotionless, but that he is controlled. I love the actor/writer commitment to Vulcan dialogue/delivery, but the excessively articulate and neutral writing and performances must have bemused the hell out of anyone who saw it and wasn't already familiar with TOS. This is surprisingly heady for what appears to be a Saturday morning cartoon, but I’m not entirely sold on the bondage gear and underpants that Vulcan children wear.

OMG it’s the pet bear monster thing Spock said he had as a child in an episode of TOS (don’t remember which). Great piece of continuity! And what I think is a throwaway gag turns out to be the heart of the episode when after a monster fight that gives a bit of punch to an otherwise fairly cerebral cartoon story, Achaya’s life is in danger. Spock goes across the desert on foot to fetch the healer, who has a totally pimped out spaceship by the way. But then I’m shocked when I realise they’re going the full Old Yeller here - this must have upset some kids when it was aired. In just a few moments of screen time, they imbue Achaya with tragedy  - he is fat, old and past-it - and his death at Spock’s request is a powerful moment. It also models Spock’s growth as he able to express love for Achaya by ending his suffering in a logical way as sustaining his agony will benefit no one. A logical decision which conveys a sense of love, Spock’s two halves moulded together

Ending on the ”times change“ joke is pretty clever, and I was surprised that after the “I just killed my dog“ scene they were still able to land an effective chuckle.

So yeah, despite a misleadingly iffy opening, this developed into a daring and stimulating adventure which was more grown up than some live-action TOS episodes, as well as providing an unexpected prequel story which gave more insight to a crew members history than ever before.

Why are they just now going in this direction? What’s the reasoning for everything from Enterprise onwards being a prequel of sorts? Enterprise itself is understandable, even if it didn’t really make the most of it’s premise a lot of the time. However, Discovery and upcoming Strange New Worlds are also set before TOS, and not even that long before the events of TOS. 

Why so many prequels? Why wait till now to move forward instead of backwards?

# My Credentials

Hello all, you don't know me, but I'm a frequent visitor and sometimes contributor to both the *startrek* and *daystrominstitute* subreddits. I have been a lifelong Star Trek fan and have watched **every** episode of every series/movie ever made. I've even watched/read related stuff like many books/comics/video games, that one Reading Rainbow episode where they go on the set, cast interviews/convention appearances, documentaries, even that weird episode of Webster.

# Get to the Point

I'm unsubbing for a very simple reason: the recently released \[CENSORED YOUTUBE CHANNEL\] video on favourite TNG episodes is completely blocked, banned, scrubbed, dematerialized and erased from the pattern buffer.

What the hell? I understood that (in a sense) when \[CENSORED YOUTUBE CHANNEL\] were doing very critical reviews of Discovery and Picard, they were being very harsh and negative. Some mods may have thought it was a bad look for the sub, what with toxic fandom being a thing.

I disagree, but an argument can be made.

No argument I can think of could warrant blocking something that sounds like: ""Bike *and Mitch's Top 5 TNG Episodes*"" (Part 1).

# Who Cares if You Want to Leave?

No one. I'm sure. But I'm making this post because I think me unsubbing is crazy.

As I said in the intro, I'm the type of person who should never ever leave this sub, the fact that I am says something terrible about the slippery slope this sub has slid down. One of the episodes the guys discuss in the video is ""The Drumhead"", I think this sub is right about the point where they've run out of even remotely legitimate targets and they've put a metaphorical ""Picard"" on the stand.

The video that CAN NOT be posted here is just two huge Star Trek fans talking about what they love about Star Trek TNG, my favourite series.

That's insane to me, and I want to be no part of a subreddit that would do that.

# For Shame!

Hopefully this isn't auto-banned, or I'm not banned before I can reply, OR I'm not shadow banned in some sort of Section 31-style assassination of my account.

I just watched *Necessary Evil*, which is a fantastic episode -- a perfect film noir that's perfect homage with zero parody. But after watching and reading the background info on Memory Alpha, I still have two questions:  


\- Since Odo let Kira go... who did he end up accusing of the murder? No one? Gul Dukat said the alternative was to execute ten random Bajorans. Is that what happened? I doubt Dukat would let Odo just shrug and drop the case.  


\- How was Kira able to come and go to the station? She didn't seem to be slave or POW. She just showed up -- and I assume she left when her assignment was over.

24,My Lower Decks Predictions,1596565972," It feels like it has been a lifetime since I sat down and wrote my predictions for the Picard series back in January. Who could have predicted what a wild and rocky year we would have way back then, when our biggest worries were how CBS was going to handle the Jean-Luc Picard character. I was almost certain that we were going to get Star Trek Discovery season 3 in the spring and then Lower Decks in the fall, but as we hit the dog days of summer, we are about to embark on twenty three straight weeks of new Star Trek!!

First and foremost, I think that an animated Star Trek show is an excellent idea! When I first heard that they were doing an animated show, I thought that it could be a great opportunity to dig into elements of the series that would typically be too expensive to shoot. Bizarre aliens (potentially quadrupeds, bug like, or plant based!), huge battles or wars and travelling to planets that would be far to expensive to construct. When it was later released that it was a comedy based show like Rick and Morty I had three thoughts 1) I have never watched that particular show, but know that it is known for being extreme 2) It would probably use low brow humour to lure in new fans and 3) It will probably laugh AT Star Trek rather than WITH Star Trek. This all makes me very nervous, as the trailer and subsequent TV spots have done little to quell those fears. I am using all of my cognitive energy to stay positive, but a third Star Trek show that alienates the fans and dumps on cannon, is the last thing the community needs. So without further ado, here are my predictions for Star Trek: Lower Decks....

The Characters 

       We will get lots and lots of who we don't like and very little of who we do. This seems to be a running theme with new Trek; the writers can write interesting characters, but they are typically left in the background, while they jam some annoying character down our throats. We saw this in ST:DISCO, where we were constantly barraged with Michael Burnham, Tilly and Spock while other characters like Detemer, Airiam and Bryce were barely mentioned or only seen in the background. Worse still, if the fan base really liked a character, like Lorca, Georgieu, Airiam or Culber, they killed them off pointlessly. All of the trailer and promotional material revolves around Ensign Mariner, who, to me, just seems annoying. Bouncing around being loud and painfully unfunny. Almost everyday I see a clip of her putting the blast shield up and down, up and down....if this is the best they've got, I am definitely worried. More so, I have a sinking suspicion that the ""main"" crew will all be really well written and interesting, but we won't see them that much, leading the fan base to ask the question ""Why did you saddle the show with this Lower Decks gimmick?"". Not to pick on Discovery, but this exact thing happened with this show. They went out of their way to make the first officer the show, only to realize that it doesn't work. We have spent years associating the shows with their captains at the helm, and so when you try and put others front and centre, everyone spends their time craning their neck to see what the Captain is up to. Don't believe me? How many people preferred Lorca, Georgieau and Pike over Michael Burnham? Oh yeah, everybody.📷

The Stories

       I think that the stories will be fine, but eventually get hamstrung by the gimmick of having only following the Ensigns. There is a reason why over the course of the seven season of The Next Generation, there was only ONE episode that focused on the lower deck crew. It's because it's not that interesting most of the time. I am almost certain that they are going to start off great, looking at the daily comings and goings of life on the lower decks before swiftly running out of ideas and forcing reasons for the lower deck crew to interact with the main crew and to be part of the action!

The Ship/Locations/Look/Feel

  This is one thing that I am pretty sure they are going to nail perfectly! They have had so much push back about the blue uniforms on Discovery and the lens flares on Picard, they are going to just give us what we want! I can already tell from the trailer that the show will look beautiful, but I think that they will go the distance to make sure the uniforms, the sounds, the planets and everything else are all amazing and will scratch every Trek fan where they itch. Setting the show slightly after TNG (the most successful Trek), and building slightly on that universe is a brilliant move and will no doubt be the thing that everyone likes the most about the show. 

The Comedy/In jokes/References

        One thing that New Trek loves to do is self reference itself. Youtube is filled with Trek fans that painstakingly go through every episode and point out the call backs, references and nods to old Trek shows. I think this trend will continue with Lower Decks, and that we may even be lucky enough to have some great cameo appearances from Trek alum, that they have snuck in to surprise us! As for the comedy, I don't think that it will work for Star Trek. I know the kind of comedy that they are leaning towards, the Rick and Morty, Family Guy shock comedy that is super hyper and in your face. I don't think that it will blend well with your average Star Trek fan, who is used to more subtle, clever humour that is sprinkled in amongst a good story. Sadly I think that the show will too often make fun of the Trekisms that we all hold so near and dear, and rather than get a laugh from a hardcore Trek fan like myself, it will more feel belittling and insulting. I also highly doubt that it will draw in fans of other shows like Family Guy, because without the deep Trek knowledge, the jokes will fall flat or not make sense. 

In Closing

       I am super excited for Lower Decks, and I want so badly for it to be a great addition to the Star Trek universe! That being said, I don't think that it will be, and will more than likely be shelved after one season. An animated show is a great idea, and using the ensigns of the show is a great idea, and having it be a comedy is a great idea, but that doesn't mean it is going to work. I am not the first person to point out that this show is not aimed at anybody. If you are a fan of zany cartoon humour, there are so many other shows that probably do it better and are not limited to Star Trek jokes. If you are a kid, it is probably too vulgar for your parents to allow you to watch it. And sadly if you are a die hard Star Trek fan like me, you are probably too sensitive to laugh when a show takes the piss out of something that you love and devote so much time to. In the end, only time will tell, and this is an instance where I will happily admit that I'm wrong if none of these predictions come true!

&amp;#x200B;

The enigmatic Garak - Cardassian-in-exile on space station Deep Space Nine - refers to himself as just a simple tailor, but everyone knows that there's more to him than that. Why was he banished from his home planet? And why does he choose exile on Deep Space Nine?

During his years playing Elim Garak on television, Andrew J. Robinson wrote a biography of his character in the form of a diary which was published by Simon and Schuster under the title: A Stitch in Time. Deep Space Nine’s popularity as a television show skyrocketed once it was taken off the air in 1999. Netflix allows for easy access to all episodes, and a strong, enthusiastic fan base has sprung up all over social media platforms. Ever since the book went out of print in the early 2000s, used copies sell online for over $100 USD. The book has gained a near cult following among Star Trek fans, making it a treasured collector’s item.

Robinson gave Garak such a distinctive vocal cadence that made his performances on the show spellbinding. During a reddit AMA in 2016, Robinson was asked several times if he would make an audiobook of A Stitch in Time and he replied that nothing would give him more pleasure. However, it is unfortunately not up to him, since Simon and Schuster, who own the book, would make that decision. Robinson's birthday is on February 14th. Let's give him the amazing gift of coming together as an enthusiastic and supportive community to ask Simon and Schuster to make this audiobook a reality! ",startrek,Woollarding,False,/r/startrek/comments/i3o3xo/a_stitch_in_time_audiobook_petition_i_need_this/

30,Thoughts on ENT-DISCO Era Trek Series and Why I think that they are a separate (and rebooted) timeline from TOS-VOY era Series.,1596559688,"I'm going to put this out there and this is just my opinion, but I think that Enterprise (2001-2005) is the first series in a soft reboot of the Trek TV Universe, since Enterprise has a lot of tech that Spock said on TOS, that ENT era ships did not have, like ship to ship visual communications, transporters or phasers, and Spock mentions that history recorded that 22nd-century tech used primitive warp drives powered by atomic engines and used atomic weapons as standard shipboard weapons during the Earth-Romulan war of 2156-2160.  Enterprise as depicted used Phasers (in the form of Phase Cannons), Warp Drive powered by dilithium and deuterium, and Had transporters and, visual ship communications. Discovery has HOLOGRAPHIC COMMUNICATIONS which TOS did not have and EVEN TNG did not have. the only mention of Holographic Communications was in DS9 episode ""For the Uniform"" and it was a prototype installed on the Defiant, DS9 and, the Excelsior Class Ship, U.S.S.  Malinche (and later Starfleet Command in the episode ""Doctor Bashir, I Presume"").   
Now I get that when they were filming TOS, TNG, DS9, VOY, that the production values were different and they didn't have access to the CGI and all the VFX/SFX that we have today, but a lot of this theory is built off of Spock's Dialogue in ""Balance of Terror"" and, the FASA RPG materials (which fit better with the TOS canon).

In Memory Alpha the Cardassians are listed as reptilian, Andrew Robinson (Garak) also stated in his book that Cardassians have reptilian ancestry. 

Watching DS9 for many years, I've never viewed the Cardassians as a reptilian species. Sure they prefer the heat and have scales but they also have hair, whiskers (Gul Macet), sweat, give live birth and breastfeed which suggest they are warm blooded endotherms. Essentially Cardassians are just primates with scales and a spoon forehead. They seem to have no problem reproducing with other mammalian like species (Bajoran, Kazon).

That dumb cyberpunk secondlife ripoff Freecloud was just dumb.

They made most of the crew in their uniforms from The Motion Picture and did a few in the maroon uniform from Star Trek Generations.

To complicate matters other figures from those films have been made (Khan, Saavik, General Chang etc).

My best guess is that there was a licensing issue for the main crew in those designs (hence why they only made them for Generations and not the other films featuring the uniforms and why side characters could have been made as well) This is of course just that, a guess.

I used to scoff when people said The Orville was truer to Trek than the new series are.

The scripts feel like they're having a dialogue with the franchise and its fans, and honestly, they feel more aware of the history, spirit, and lore of Trek than the new Trek series we've seen.

Maybe it's not all MacFarlane, I know there are other Trek alumni associated with it, particularly Brannon Braga and Johnathan Frakes, among others. But, unlike JJ Abrams, I feel like being given creative control over the Star Trek franchise would actually be a lifelong dream come true for MacFarlane. 

One argument against handing the franchise to MacFarlane may be his comedic roots. However, the Orville plays like solid Trek, even without the comedy. In fact, according to the episode of Geek's Guide to the Galaxy which reviewed season 1 of The Orville, MacFarlane had not intended for the show to be a comedy at all, but the network insisted, so it could be classified as parody, and thus protected from any copyright infringement litigation.",startrek,zen_mutiny,False,/r/startrek/comments/i30yup/finally_started_watching_the_orville_can_we_give/

In my opinion, Discovery just works better if it's not Prime cannon. We all know that the differences are due to modern production and modern tech being projected into the future. Plus rights issues when CBS and Viacom were separate entities. But to try to fit DSC Enterprise in with Prime cannon is a feat of mental gymnastics I'm not capable of. Like when the Eaglemoss book on the 1701 tries to put DSC Enterprise in line with the 60s version, then tell me it got refit back to the one we see in TOS.

However, if you make it a separate timeline, then everything just works. I know there was backlash to the Kelvin films being a new timeline, but if you're going to try to bring the 21st century Trek ascetic and tell me it's the same ship for the cage, I think that's just a mistake. Plus, new timeline give you freedom to tell whatever stories you want without trying to cram it in to established cannon. And they seem to want to tell large stories.

Prequel series are always difficult. I say, don't  hamstring yourselves with it. Plus, then you can take established events and change them. Play with audience expectations.

Give lower decks a chance and just maybe it might be good. I’m still going to watch it to se how it is because I like all trek for what they are.

She reveals that she has the same (as a female of course), then a sad ending as she too is sent to conversion therapy.

Back in 1992, this was a relatively progressive episode, being a metaphor for homosexuality. It went not quite as far as it could have gone - Riker's love interest was still played by a woman - but it was enough to get hate mail from conservative people so I guess progressive for its time.

But now, this episode seems to really miss gender identity - and it could even be interpreted as an argument against it. I bet there have been folks watching this story, who interpreted the androgynous leadership as ""dem liberal elite"" who suppress ""natural gender roles"" in favour of unnatural equality.

55,"Forgive me for gushing, but DS9 is (so far) the best Trek series ever.",1596339328," \*\*MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD\*\*

Just finished a 4-episode night, beginning with ***The Begotten*** and ending with ***By Inferno's Light***.

I can't think of any other show that has had a perfect stretch of 4 episodes in a row (admittedly an objective thought). I have a habit of scoring every episode of every TV show I watch on my IMDB app after watching, and so far for me these are my perfect 10's (from latest to earliest):

By Inferno's Light

In Purgatory's Shadow

For the Uniform

The Begotten

Trials and Tribble-ations

Apocalypse Rising

Crossfire

Paradise Lost

Our Man Bashir

Whispers

The Visitor

The Way of the Warrior

The Die Is Cast

The Search: Part II

The Wire

Necessary Evil

Duet

\*\*\*\*

I don't think I've ever watched a show (let alone a Trek) that has this many ""perfect"" episodes. Obvious standouts so far are:

***The Visitor*** \- Tony Todd is fantastic, and just hits deep especially for someone who has regrets about their own relationship with a parent

***Duet*** \- The first episode that really showed how awesome the writing could be, and also the point when the show first tells you that it's willing to blur the lines between good and bad by its own terms. That ending is killer too.

***Whispers*** \- The paranoia that just builds and builds and never lets up, and then suddenly pulls the rug from under you with another gut-punch of an ending.

***For The Uniform*** \- Two words: BAD-ASS SISKO. If Duet was showing you that DS9 was willing to blur the lines between black and white, this was the episode that showed you there was no line after all; and everything is just a shade of gray.

***The Die Is Cast*** \- The first large-scale space battle of the show, this episode truly blew me away with the Battle of Omarion Nebula; but it was the interplay between Garak and Odo (including the preceding episode) plus that shocking last-minute twist that makes this an all-time classic.

***Our Man Bashir*** \- Holodecks episodes are hit or miss (especially during the TNG era), but when a holodeck episode manages to both be so much fun and tense/nerve-wracking at the same time then it's a special mix altogether.

***Trials and Tribble-ations*** \- Is there anything else to say that hasn't been said about this one? So much fun. And bonus points for foreshadowing Terry Farrell's marriage to Adam Nimoy unintentionally years in advance.

***Crossfire*** \- I love me a good Odo-sode, and this one was no exception. A very simple title for a heartbreaking episode. Makes you wanna jump into your screen and give the Changeling a big hug.

***In Purgatory's Shadow/By Inferno's Light*** \- And this brings me to the latest amazing two-parter I've seen so far. One jaw-dropper after another. The Bashir was saw on DS9 for the past few episodes was a changeling! Garak is Tain's son! Dukat (and Cardassia) joins the Dominion! Jeebus. What a doozy. Even the sight of the Starfleet Armada warping in with the Romulan contingency was freaking awesome.

Then one evening you happen to see the 1957 classic The Enemy Below on public broadcast and you think to yourself, ""Man I wish I could see the crew of the Enterprise go up against an enemy like that.""  

Well on December 15, 1966 your wish became a reality when The Balance of Terror aired.  The entire crew of enemy German sub that you loved so much in The Enemy Below are back transformed into Romulans and recast with different actors.  

Captain von Stolberg originally played by Curt Jurgens has been reborn as the Romulan Commander and is now played by Marc Lenard.  Just like before he is an old warrior who is devoted to duty to his homeland but disillusioned with the present leadership that the homeland is in. 

The loyal First Officer Heinie Schwaffer is now the Centurion.  Played at first by Theodore Bikel now played by John Warburton.  In addition to trusting him with his service the Romulan Commander confides his innermost feelings to him just like before.  

Then there is the Führer-loving Von Hole played by Kurt Kreuger in the movie has become the Praetor- loving Decius played by Lawrence Montaigne. He is every bit as dedicated to the regime as the Commander is disgusted with it. 

Now instead of fighting Captain Murrell they have to go against Captain Kirk. What is better than this?

Dude, have you ever watched Star Trek before!? Like, any of it?
It has always been political. It has always been Leftist. Gene Roddenberry was a Socialist. TOS had the first interracial kiss on TV. All TNG era shows covered multiple political and social topics from racism, to POW handling, made some points toward same-sex relationships with the Trill, to the Horrors and demise of morality in War time- in short, Star Trek has always been political and always had an agenda.

We learn he's created a ""newer"" version of Data which can experience emotion (often to the detriment of himself and others).

We also see Data create a ""child"" of his own, which is again described as something both amazing, unique and a possible window into understanding Data himself as well as the nature of sentient life.

We simply cannot get enough. So now, for a little bit of fun and an excuse to re-watch some Trek episodes again, went back to TNG's 'Chain of Command' in Season 6 to start viewing TNG/DS9/VOY in chronological (star date) order, based on the viewing list from the website [The Star Trek Chronology Project](https://thestartrekchronologyproject.blogspot.com/2009/09/and-now-conclusion.html).

We just finished watching DS9's 'Invasive Procedures' (2x04), with TNG's 'Interface' to follow (7x03). I have to admit, watching DS9's 'Emissary' (1x01/02) right after TNG's 'Chain of Command' (6x10/11) was an awesome transition and a great introduction into Deep Space Nine; and watching DS9's 'The Passenger' (1x09) and TNG's 'Birthright, Part 1' (6x16) right after is *perfect*, since Dr. Crusher, Picard, Worf, and Geordi visit DS9 and Dr. Bashir visits the Enterprise D with Data.

What we are also looking forward to is watching Star Trek: Enterprise's 'These Are the Voyages...' (4x22) right after TNG's 'The Pegasus' (7x12) because the series finale of Enterprise is better off as an in-season episode of The Next Generation versus being the series finale of Enterprise. We also plan to watch the TNG movies between the TV episodes, which will be exciting to experience, and finish the TNG-era with Star Trek: Picard once again.

Finally, we plan to go back and watch Enterprise again (because it's such an awesome show) and follow-up with 'The Cage,' followed by Discovery Seasons 1 and 2, which will then allow us to transition to The Original Series, which we both have not watched in it's entirety.

Denise Crosby was awesome, Jonathan Frakes loves every fan, John De Lancie talked to me for 20 minutes (I was the only person in line), and I bonded with Mirina Siritis over soccer and teasing my brother who loves her but couldn't come.  

But by far the best interaction I ever had was with THE George Takei.  I went to his autograph table and I was wearing the yellow TOS uniform and had a picture of him to sign.  As soon as he saw me he stood up and said with his silky voice, ""That is a great uniform, I know because I wore it.  So you get a 'Galactic Greetings' on your picture. Only people who wear that uniform get it.""  And he shook my hand (convention goers know most celebrities even the nicest won't shake hands because they don't want to get sick, understandable).

I then told him he inspired me and my family in so many ways, I joined the Navy in part because of Star Trek, he helped my little brother feel ok about being gay but masculine, and he inspired me to work with the Japanese Internment remembrance group in Central Valley CA.  He stood up after signing my picture, grabbed my shoulders and said, ""Son it's people like you who inspire me too.""

11,Opinion on the Star Trek XI (2009),1596229198,"As a huge fan since the very beginning of my childhood (of all the Star Trek content) but especially to TOS and TNG,  I watched the first new Star Trek movie today again, Star Trek XI (2009) and wanted to share my thoughts on the movie with you. Please tell me, what you think about it.

I saw the movie eleven years ago as a 14 year old boy, and of course I loved it. But I must tell you, what I saw today is absolutely different. Currently I am rewatching TNG right now and sometimes moan about those passages, where they talk about feelings and drawing all those lines between the series and the former situation on earth. But now, I really see now, what a quality content this is. In TNG and also in TOS. The characters are evolving, sharing their thoughts, there is disagreement between the officers and deeper discussions what to do next. There is no ""hero"", who decides everything, but the people, who makes a decision and has to live with the consequences. It actually really feels how humans would act in normal life.

Star Trek XI is a great movie, it looks good and stuff, but to me, it appeals to catch up the absolute mainstream not to continue the original messages of Star Trek. All those dialogues are absolute crap, not interesting discussing between Kirk and Spock and on top of all that: That last scene, where Kirk offers Nero his help, he refuses and Kirk gives the order to destroy the whole ship ""with everything they have"". I am wondering if ""the real Kirk"" would ever give such an order. I don't think so.

So, to sum that a little up. Its a nice movie to watch it casually, it seems to me to simply catch up as many visitors as possible and to be a CGI festival, but to me, it is not giving me any of that original Trekkie feeling. But maybe, I am just too harsh with it. Its a movie, with lots of less time to develop, compared to a full series. On IMDb, Star Trek XI hast 7,9 and all the other movies before it have mostly 6,x or even 5,x. Its absolutely unintelligible to me.

The A-plot of the episode had Kira go down to Bajor at Winn's request to try and convince her old cell leader to return some farming equipment that the government wants back.

Long story short, she ends up on the run from Winn along with Shakkar.  Sisko has a few good scenes where Winn tries to convince him to use starfleet resources to hunt down Kira and her friends, and Sisko says no.

Meanwhile, on the station: O'brien is good at darts.  That's it.  That's the whole plot.  Quark starts a betting pool on how long Miles will win at darts, and then he injures his shoulder and stops winning at darts.

27,What do you think happens after 'Star Trek Beyond'? (Kelvin-verse),1596207349,"Part me of me really needs to know what happens in the Kelvin timeline post-Beyond. Like do some of the events from the movies still happen? If so, how would it be different? 

Like does the Kelvin-version of the Enterprise-A eventually get a prime Enterprise-A refit? (The nacelles at the end of Beyond always bothered me, because I love the Enterprise-A nacelles, if you're going to do a new version of that ship, at least update that)

Is V'ger still a thing? (Presumably) 🤔

""Into Darkness"" ended with Khan being frozen instead of being dropped off on Ceti Alpha V, so I guess that would nullify the events of STII and STIII, right? Because the Genesis torpedo isn't stolen and detonated, so the Genesis Planet is never created out of the Mutara Nebula. Captain Tyrrell is still flying around with Chekov on the USS Reliant, Carol and David are still working on perfecting the genesis matrix from Regula 1, Kirk remains Admiral, Spock doesn't die, Scotty's nephew doesn't die, maybe Saavik eventually takes command of the Enterprise-A? Vulcan is still blown up though... ☹
(Unless of course Kirk randomly decided to relocate Khan and his crew to Ceti Alpha V? Idk if this Kirk could trust this Khan after what happened in 'Into Darkness' tho)

Now what about the whale probe thing? What happens there? The only reason Kirk and crew were able to stop it is because they were hiding out on Vulcan at the time with their stolen Klingon Bird of Prey, but the events of STIII didn't happen, and they're already on their replacement Enterprise, so they might have been caught off guard along with the rest of the Federation. Hmmm

Anywho, then there's STV, which is barely cannon to begin with because how did they manage to get to the center of the galaxy in a matter of hours, when according to Voyager that would take decades? 🤷‍♂️

Ok, then there's STVI, which is pretty hard to extrapolate, because... according to the IDW 'Into Darkness' comic tie-in &lt;googles title&gt; ""Star Trek: Khan"", Admiral Marcus used Khan (after giving him a genetic face lift) to blow up the Klingon moon of Praxis! - but that was like... waaaay earlier in the timeline! Like before their 5 year mission! So it's really hard to even speculate on just how completely trashed the interstellar politics are at this point, but I feel like Praxis being destroyed 30 years early would've maybe accelerated the Federation / Klingon Cold War. Who's to say if Kirk and his crew would even be a part of these events in this timeline? Kelvin Kirk might not even have the same bias against Klingons because in this version, they didn't kill his son... supposedly. 

Does the timeline eventually correct itself? Do the events of TNG, Generations, First Contact, DS9, Voyager, etc mostly play out the same way?

28,What is your favourite small moment in Star Trek?,1596206821,"I'm currently on the second season of DS9, and I don't know why this struck me so much, but I now think my favourite 'small moment' in all of Star Trek is at the end of the episode Armageddon Game. The episode itself is pretty decent, even though the speech by Bashir in the middle of it is TRULY cringe worth. But &lt;spoilers ahead&gt; ...

The plot revolves around Bashir and O'Brien getting trapped on a planet, and their deaths have been faked. Proof is provided to DS9 in the form of a video recording that shows some sort of pulse vaporizing everybody. Nobody questions it, because, well, why would these people lie? That is until Keiko watches the video and sees her husband drinking coffee ... IN THE AFTERNOON!

She rushes into Sisko's office and shows the video, with the proof that the video has been doctored, because her husband would never, ever, EVER drink coffee in the afternoon. She knows him too well! So off go Sisko and Dax, they discover the ruse, and rescue Julian and Miles at the very last second.

The episode ends with Miles and Keiko laughingly talking in their room. Keiko hands Miles a cup their daughter has made.

""Man, I could go for a coffee right now"" says Miles.

""But ... you don't drink coffee in the afternoon?"" Keiko says.

O'Brien scoffingly laughs. ""Of course I do.""

Keiko - ""WHAT????""

I really love that the entire reason O'Brien and Bashir were saved was because Keiko *thought* she knew her husband's habits so well, but it turns out she really didn't. It was a very believable moment for me, and ended off this relatively decent episode with a huge laugh.

29,My favorite TOS viewing experience (share yours),1596205207,"In the 80s, TOS was still huge, near the top (if not the top) rated show in syndication.  I was in college and used to catch it occasionally in a TV/leisure/common area in the dorms where I lived.  Usually about 5-10 other people would be there, some as ""regulars"" and others who were walking by and stopped to watch for a while.  The common area was near the cafeteria so there was a fair amount of foot traffic as TOS came on around dinner time.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sure we've all had the fun shared experience of watching a good TV episode or movie with a group that includes a mix of repeat viewers and first-timers, and these TOS get-togethers were usually like that.  It was always nice when a particularly good episode came on, as the crowds were usually a little bigger and more enthusiastic for those.  My favorite episode is ""Doomsday Machine"" (DM), and I was disappointed to see that the day it was airing, there was to be a ""theme day"" at the cafeteria with some planned events, so I figured dang, the whole area will be busy with other stuff, so no shared DM experience.  What unfortunate timing.

&amp;#x200B;

But:  the day came, and it was very crowded, but I noticed that despite this, the TV area wasn't being used.  So right on time, I turned the TV on and there was DM starting, and a few people came to watch as usual.  I expected that somebody would come over to tell us we had to go, the area was about to be used as part of the event, etc, but no... we got to watch the whole thing.  In fact, the ""bad timing"" turned out to be a wonderful thing, because there were far more people around than normal, and many stopped what they were doing to come share the viewing experience.  By the last act, it was standing room only, 50 people or more!  It was so fun.  When Sulu was counting down to the Constellation explosion, ""five, four ...,"" the crowd chanted along, and kept going during the final outside shots of the Constellation, ""Three!!  Two!!  One!!"" and then a little laughter when the explosion was a few seconds ""late.""  It was a really fun and spirited group, and one of the best shared viewing experiences I've ever had.

49,"Theory: The TNG Films and ""Picard"" take place in an Alternate Universe",1596173007,"The Star Trek TNG Films, from Generations to Nemesis, take place in an alternate timeline, perhaps the Kelvin timeline, but not the original. By extension, Star Trek Picard takes place in this alternate universe as well. 

Call this a shower thought, or more appropriately, a stay awake in bed and stare at the ceiling thought, but I believe this theory reconciles the inconsistencies and plot-holes that the respective movies and show brought up, and gives hope to a possibility of seeing a happy future for all our favorite characters.

It begins with Star Trek Generations, the movie that never should have been. Following the weirdest plot contrivance in any Star Trek film, that being the newly christened Enterprise B not having a full crew, missing features and being the ""only ship in range"" to help people in danger despite still being within the solar system (THE HEART OF THE FEDERATION) the film jumps forward to the Enterprise D. Picard gets an emergency communique from Star-fleet about his dead family and immediately you can tell something is off. Initially, you can notice that the bridge is different, from the additional crewmen positions, the lighting, the paneling, etc. This extends to the rest of the ship, including Data's quarters, which are bizarrely dark. Perhaps it's all part of the stylistic decisions by the filmmakers to make the Enterprise seem more cinematic, or perhaps they're minor clues. The other times we saw these sorts of changes included the episode ""Yesterday's Enterprise"", which showed a darker, almost Terran Empire-like Enterprise D, with a rearranged command bridge, moody lighting and a more emotional Picard (more on that later). These changes are all present because of this Enterprise being from a different timeline. Additionally, in the episode ""Parallels"", we see Worf transported ad nausea between different universes, which often included many different looking Enterprise D bridges, the exact same detail to emphasize that this isn't the prime universe. I think it's a logical extrapolation that the movie's bridge is different for the exact same reason.

Next change of note is Data's emotion chip, which has somehow become much larger and now fits inside his head instead of his neck. This change could have been made to help the audience understand what's happening, or perhaps it's the second clue. Perhaps this is another universe where technology is less advanced than what we see on the TNG show, which is further backed up by the Enterprise D getting wrecked by an old Bird of Prey and ""transparent aluminum"" windows shattering like glass when the Enterprise crashes. None of this would ever happen on the show. There are plenty more examples with the other films, such the totally useless EMH in First Contact or the stupid dune buggy Picard drives in Nemesis. 

The third clue comes in the form of Captain Kirk. Back in the TNG episode ""Relics"", a rescued Scotty exclaims that Kirk must have taken the old Enterprise out of moth balls to come looking for him. However, in Generations, Scotty explicitly confirms Kirk's ""death"" and never sees him again, first hand... Movie mistake? Maybe, or maybe not. Perhaps Kirk never got sucked into the nexus...in the original timeline. 

What I am proposing is simple. Star Trek Generations onward to Star Trek Picard, we are watching an alternate universe from the original TNG, as well as from Deep Space 9 and Voyager. In this different universe, technology is less advanced, Picard is an overly-emotional captain, which explains why movie Picard doesn't line up at all with the man the show portrayed him as (him vehemently hating and fearing Borg in First Contact despite having gotten over it on the show; acting with his dick instead of his brain in Insurrection; and him somehow loving children in a Christmas story while in the nexus despite making it clear many times that he doesn't like kids in Generations), and conflicts are always solved with violence, not negotiation. 

This theory also clears up some inconsistencies between DS9 and Voyager in regards to Star Trek First Contact. In First Contact, the USS Defiant, made specifically to fight the Borg, gets its ass handed to it. This makes no sense for the original universe, where we see it kick ass, but does make sense for a universe where technology is less advanced. Also in First Contact we meet the Borg Queen, who, spoilers, dies in the end. Strangely enough, though, the exact same Borg Queen is alive and well during Voyager. It never made sense to me that she'd be in two places at once unless Voyager takes place in the original universe where she never led the mission to assimilate Earth and stop First Contact. Perhaps she only did that in the alternate universe where the movies took place, and she instead she tactfully stayed put in the heavily fortified Unimatrix One. 

The point of what I'm saying is that the horrible future that awaited the Enterprise D crew in the films didn't happen to the characters we know and love from the show. Instead, it only happened to a very unfortunate Enterprise D crew in a darker universe, the Darkest Timelime™ as Abed once put it. The events of that universe were similar (likely not the same) up until the end of ""All the Good Things"" where things took a turn for the worse for the TNG movie crew. For all we know, everything is fine back in the prime timeline. The Enterprise D got a proper send off, Data is alive, Worf didn't get fat, a supernova didn't go off millions of years early and wipe out a race that is technologically advanced enough to know about and stop it before it would happen and is widely spread across the galaxy anyway so they have enough ships to escape and losing a single planet is no biggie, racism against Androids isn't a thing and Hugh and Icheb didn't die unnecessary and rather pathetic deaths. Also, spoilers.

If the current Star Trek writers were to adopt this theory into canon, I am willing to be this would make a lot of Star Trek fans happy.

50,Why does enterprise have visual hails?,1596171174,"does it bother anyone that enterprise from “star trek: enterprise” somehow has visual coms despite the canon being that in that era even throughout the romulan war they only had the ability to communicate through audio to other ships not visual? however the enterprise often hails ships with a visual channel, despite this. 

for me it itches me a bit everytime they use a visual communication because it reminds me of the episode in TOS when the enterprise first re-encounters the romulans. because its a big plot point that no one even knew what romulans looked like until that moment. enterprise also doesn’t show visual coms of romulans so technically canon conserved there, but its still not quite right imo.

76,This is a story about the time I set a tourist boat to battle stations,1596128554,"Several years ago I had a job as a tour guide on a boat. Our audience was mainly families and elderly people who we would take along the river for an hours cruise. My job was to provide the commentary about the wildlife on the river and the history of the local area over an the boats PA system, as well as doing various safety checks and procedures. I was pretty good at my job and always earned far more tips than any of my colleagues. At the halfway point of the tour when the skipper would turn the boar around I would usually take a minute to stop turn off my microphone and have a drink of water. For obvious reasons when doing the tours I would always turn my phone off. However, on the day this story takes place I forgot to turn off my phone, I also forgot to turn off the microphone when I grabbed a drink of water (you can probably already see where this is going). At this time my text message alert was the classic Star Trek red alert sound. During my mini-break I placed down the microphone next to my phone and of course at that exact moment I got a text message.  


The red alert noise boomed out of every speaker on the boat and for a split second I had a choice to either profusely apologise and assure everyone there was nothing to worry about or to lean into my error and hope for the best. I chose the latter. I gave the order ""Red alert! All hands to battle stations!"". Cue a few awkward laughs and confused looks from the tourists. Except for one middle aged dad with his kids who got up and announced ""Romulan Warbird de-cloaking off the starboard bow captain!"". At this point I was already committed to the bit so kept going with an increasingly hammed up Picard impression ""Arm photon torpedos and fire at will Mr Worf"".Without missing a beat the dad, who was also clearly enjoying this back and forth as much as me, replied ""Their shields are holding captain"". With the boat now completing it's turning process and about to being heading back along the river I saw an opportunity to wrap this up and restore the regular tour for the rest of the increasingly amused/bemused tourists, ""Helm bring us about, evasive manoeuvres!"". With the boat now straightening up and coming back up to cruising speed (about 4 knots) I waited a moment before announcing ""Get us out of here! Heading &lt;random numbers&gt; maximum warp. Engage!"". At which point I smoothly (in my mind at least) announced ""Apologies for that brief interlude ladies and gentlemen, Romulans are an operational hazard along this section of the river but we seem to have escaped so let's get back to the tour...""  


At the end of the tour the middle aged dad approached me and told me how our little Trek interlude had made his kids day he is a big Trek fan and introduced them to Star Trek a couple of years previously and then gave me the 2nd biggest tip I ever got whilst working in that job. I expected that the skipper was going to give me both barrels for messing around like that whilst giving a tour but he said absolutely nothing.

87,"I doubt I’m the first one to think of this, but First Contact should have been a joint TNG/DS9 movie",1596110582,"I’m currently watching DS9 for the first time, having only gotten into Star Trek in the last two years. I started with TNG, then watched all the movies and a bit of TOS. I’m currently on season 6 of DS9. 

And as I’ve been watching it (I love it btw!) I was thinking that if some of the crew of DS9 were in First Contact, i think it would have worked quite well. I think Sisko, Dax and possibly O’Brien could have fit in the movie.  (If O’Brien did come back, it would have been in Broccoli’s place I think). 

For Sisko, I think that a lot of Lily Sloans scenes actually fit him. Especially the “Blow up the damn ship Picard!” Scene, I can just picture that coming from Sisko. It also would have been a cool dynamic for worf, having his current and old commanding figures at odds with each other for a bit. I think Sloane could still be in the movie, but her scenes obviously would need to be changed for it to make sense. 

And for Picard, it would still kind of work for him. Instead of an old human who he maybe views as naive of the situation, it would be another starfleet captain, and he knows Sisko has a grudge against him for mildly killing his wife. 

I’m not too sure how Dax would fit in, I’m not a writer by any means, I just think she’s a great character and probably could work, provided it’s a good reason.

Would that be considered a violation of the treaty? If said Romulan was not affiliated with the military and was just living their life.

0,Star Wars: Phantom Menace is high-key a Star Trek movie,1596088002,"For the most part, Star Wars and Star Trek are opposite ends of the sci-fi spectrum in many ways. Star Wars is a Romantic series featuring the dilemmas of ultimate good vs ultimate evil, the power of family and love, and space battles with starships and lightsabers. Star Trek is an Enlightenment series featuring morally grey discussions, the power of the individual to make a difference in society, and the postponement of violence unless there is no other alternative.

So I'm re-watching The Phantom Menace and I have to admit that there's a lot of Star Trek influences in the movie. For one is the focus of inter-galactic relationships, with the Federation Trade blockade in the opening scenes. The heroes attempt to negotiate, which in itself looks like a Star Trek plot itself. There's a diversity of aliens unlike the Original Trilogy, which was humanoid dominated, with all these Gungans, Neimodians, Toydarians and what-not. There's a greater thematics of politics and the corruption within a seemingly stable society and whatnot.

It's just me, but I really do feel like that a lot of the Phantom Menace works better as a Star Trek movie than a Star Wars movie.

1,"Were there any characters who had to ""grow on you"" over time before you began to like them?",1596087144,"Who and why? 

For me, the one that stands out the most is Dr. Bashir. I simply couldn't stand him in the first season of DS9 and even now when I re-watch those episodes, I cringe. 

I was immediately put off by his aggressive advances on Jadzia Dax. That behavior was sexual harassment at the worst and inappropriate towards a coworker at the least, and as a medical professional he should have known better. He even displayed a potentially dangerous mindset and behavior in one episode when he asked if he could walk Dax back to her quarters and she said: ""That won't be necessary, Julian, thank you"", but instead of hearing that as the ""no"" it was clearly intended to be, he thought about it and said... ""not necessary, but not forbidden"" and followed her. Yes, he did witness her kidnapping right after that and alerted Sisko and security so they were able to prevent her from being taken from the station. Which is, I'm sure, why the writers had him follow her. I still think that there were plenty of other ways to make that happen that didn't involve a medical professional being incapable of setting aside his own desires and hearing what was clearly being said. In the real world, people who think and behave that way often become abusive and violent when they don't get what they want. 

That was my starting point with Julian Bashir, but I do feel like the writers improved his character and he became a much better person, professional, and friend to those around him, even the beautiful women he was attracted to. This did balance him out for me, so by the time season 7 came around, I was ok with Bashir. I still can't say he is one of my favorite characters, but I didn't despise him anymore. I even began to like him because of his friendships with O'Brien and Garak and then some of the selfless behavior he eventually displayed.

Well...at least no worse than any other series that's just getting kicked off (looking at you, DS9). There is one thing I'm wondering about though...

The last episode of Voyager ended with BAMF Admiral Janeway kicking Borg ass while equally-BAMF Captain Janeway made good on her promise to get her crew home. The first handful of Enterprise episodes introduce T'Pol and Hoshi largely as props to demonstrate the threat of the Suliban and the difficulties of 22nd century space exploration. Hoshi goes on an away mission for the purpose of getting scared, T'Pol takes a steamy shower with Trip...it goes on.

I know that part of Enterprise's ethos was to demonstrate the ""long road getting from there to here"" and part of that was showing how the egalitarian 24th century came to be, but the writing doesn't exactly point out the flawed thinking of 22nd century Enterprise's treatment of its female characters. In fact, in their treatment, the show becomes internally incongruous (in S1E5, why does Ah'Len have boobs if the male Xyrillians carry the child and sprout nipples for their nourishment?) without a nod from the writers in the direction of ""hey look at these silly 22nd century people being silly 22nd century people.""

32,My pitch for an Klingon Cardassian Alliance post Picard,1596051555,"I always loved the Klingon Cardassian Alliance in the DS9 Mirror Universe, and since the show set a precident of the two races being able to work together I came up with a brief synopsis of how we could see a new Alliance between the two in the Prime Universe post Picard.

After the end of the Dominion War, the Federation and Klingon Empire vowed to help rebuild Cardassia after the Dominion decimated the population and infrastructure on Cardassia Prime.

When news of the Romulan Star Empire's upcoming disaster became known, and Picard leading the Federation into a massive rescue mission, the Federation diverted almost all available aid and manpower away from Cardassia. The Klingons still having bad blood with the Romulans, refused to help the Romulans and stayed on Cardassia. This caused some hard feelings between Cardassia and the Federation, and strengthened the ties between the Klingons and Cardassians. Even after the Mars attack and the Federation canceling the Romulan Rescue Armada, the Federation spent no real effort to return to keeping their agreement to help Cardassia Prime.

Garak, the major voice behind the new Cardassian Civilian Governent, became quite close to the new Chancellor of the Klingon Empire, Martok. Manybtimes things were settled for the two powers just in conversation between the two men..

In a stroke of genius by Martok, the introduction of the Klingon House system to the Cardassians worked like amazing speed and enthusiasm. With centuries of Military State control, the Cardassian population was comprised of millions of former military members that had no idea of how to proceed after the Civilian took over and cut the Military massively. Popular Guls and Legates found it easy to recruit former comrades into their own private armies and resource building conglomerates.

The thing that no one saw coming was the embrace of Klingon religion that the Cardassian people gave the Klingon war monks. Emperor Kahless petitioned the Cardassian Civilian Government for the chance to open Klingon Temples to help with reconstruction and to build ties between the two peoples. The Cardassian State for centuries stifled any religion on Cardassia Prime (The State is more important than any God), so the Cardassian's were thirsting for a spiritual part to their everyday lives. The word of Kahless spread like wildfire and became the ""IN"" thing in their Cardassian high society. Suddenly many Cardassian children were being taught Bat'leth skills in temples all over Cardassia. Cardassians, well known for their artistry quickly adopted the blades to their own cultural identity making Cardassian versions of all of the traditional Klingon blades. This in turn, caused a trend on Qo'nus, with Klingon Houses investing in artistic expressions in their armor and weapons to match that of the new Cardassian art movement.

Martok, understanding the importance of Klingons embracing paths that may have been frowned upon before (he himself being with out Noble blood and ascending to the Chancellor of the Klingon High Council) made sweeping change in Klingon laws regarding the different classes in Klingon society. Lawyers and artists were suddenly being encouraged instead of being scorned. Chancellor Martok will be forever seen as the Klingon that led the Klingon Empire to be a leader in the Alpha/ Beta Quadrant, instead of just a bully that fought for scraps.

25 years after the Dominion War, the two powers formalized a Union between the two powers. The Cardassian Civilian Government officially handed over power to Chancellor Martok, and in turn the new Klingon Cardassian High Council was expanded by 50% and Cardassian Houses were given seats. Chancellor Martok declared that all Cardassian Houses would have the same rights as any Klingon Houses. The two people would become one in the new Klingon Cardassian Empire. 

It was something that the Federation should have seen coming, the two races are a perfect match for one another. Cardassian don't have to bother lying to the Klingons, as a Klingon will kill you whether you are truthful or not. And Klingons can't bully the Cardassians as their strength and military prowess equal to their own. 

The first marriages between Klingon and Cardassian Houses have only just begun, but with the technology that facilitates hybrid births between races being perfected, the alliance is showing stability for now.

There has been a rush to exchange and share technology in the new alliance, including new Cardassian built ships with cloaking devices and some ""raptor inspired design"" as well as new Klingon ships with more precise designs and much heavier armors.

Martok, mainly due to Captain Worf and the ties built during the War, has kept somewhat good ties to the Federation vowing to direct all expansion of the Empire away from Federation/ Empire borders. For the time being the Federation seems content with the Empire's diplomatic ties, but some are concerned that now that Cardassia and Qo'nos have one focus, the Romulan territories will prove to be a temptation that Empire will not be able to ignore.",startrek,jmsturm,False,/r/startrek/comments/i074xf/my_pitch_for_an_klingon_cardassian_alliance_post/

It comes down to the main character's point of view.
In Enterprise they were a novelty, truly alien compared to Vulcans
In TOS Kirk was scared of them so they looked kind of human
In the TOS movies he grew weary of the cold War between the Federation and the Empire and his mistrust grew ti hate which leads to fear(tgis was when they were still figuring out the ridges and some of the earlier stuff was pretty scary/rough compared to 90s Trek
90s Trek we've been in alliance for decades and while there were still mistrust on both sides the look softened a bit and us probably closest to their objective appearance. 
In Disco Michael's parents were murdered in front of her by Klingons of course they're going to look scarier to her.

46,Similarities between the 2005 DW reboot and the Star Trek reboot in the 90’s,1596044518,"Is it just me or are there many similarities in the ways Doctor Who and Star Trek franchise were successfully rebooted for new audience in the 2000’s and 1990’s respectively. Both had the tremendous task of rebooting the classic original runs of staple sci-fi franchises roughly 15 years after they had last aired. Both reboots produced one main show (Doctor Who, TNG) that ran consecutively with 2 spin off shows that shared many carefully planned plot points that tied them together. The Next Generation and RTD’s Who both replicate the format of their respective original runs, whilst updating for a new generation of fans, and are largely family oriented. Deep Space Nine is analogous to Torchwood, in that both were the first spin offs to be produced from their respective franchises, and both focus greatly on grittier character based drama plotlines. Voyager is analogous to SJA, in that both are the second spin off, and both feature lighter storylines (this thematic split is more strict in RTD’s universe that Trek’s, but nevertheless is present in both). Both also happen to feature female leads, and are centre around more isolated settings (Bannerman Rd, Earth and USS Voyager, Delta Quadrant). Both were greatly successful in revitalising their respective franchises, and spawning new “golden eras” so to speak. I wouldn’t be surprised if RTD used the reboot of Star Trek as a case study and an example to follow, since prior to his success with Doctor Who, the reboot of Star Trek was the prime example of how to do a reboot. Regardless, they were both faced with heavy burdens of rebooting loved television series, and both were inordinately successful. Thoughts?

59,Let's take a moment to appreciate the eye candy that Star Trek throws at us.,1596024664,"Hear me out. While Star Trek has always been about the human condition, bettering ourselves, discussing controversial topics and a positive future.... since the Original Series in the 60's, attractive people, attractive bodies, revealing clothing and suggestive themes and, well, Sex, has always been there.

Maybe not directly, or thrown in your face, but it's always been there, lurking in the background and suggested in ways most younger kids may not get until they're older.

And I'm not just talking about the ladies of Star Trek and I'm not just making this out as something just for the guys to hoot and go on about all the catsuits and cleavage. While early on it was primarily all about the women in tin foil bikinis or semi miniskirts, as more series came about and times changed, the eye candy for women also started to increase and perhaps almost on par.

Almost. I'm not here to split hairs. But from Kirk going shirtless or shirt torn, to Riker's hairy chest outfit, Data and Yar, or the form fitting uniforms, to the catsuits, to the holodeck/holosuite programs, to Trip and T'Pol greasing it up in their underwear in the decontamination room, Mirror Kira, the list goes on.

Heck, even the camera work in episodes are specifically designed to include someone walking away from the camera while it's focused on their wedgie butt (DS9 episode where Dax was almost kidnapped for a murder Kurzon didn't do) before they pan to the main cast discussing something. You'll have a shot of Archer talking on the com with T'Pol's boob just hanging off to the side, or even Archer in the shower with a small section of frosted vinyl on the glass to cover enough up to stay PG-13.

Of course you got the notorious scene in Into Darkness of Marcus changing clothes. Was it necessary? No, but it's Star Trek and it never was, but it's always been a part of what Star Trek is.

You hear from time to time about the old Star Wars vs Star Trek, and how some think ST is boring because there's less action and it's more about thought. People like Star Wars for the action, lore and drama. That's cool. People like Star Trek for different reasons, but what some seem to forget is that where Star Trek may lack in constant action, it makes up in sexual references, which Star Wars kind of avoids as much as possible.

Hell, the Planet Risa is basically hinted as one big orgy planet.

Star Trek has even started to open up to all this towards the LGBTQ community here and there, but wherever you stand in your orientation and gender, there's always been something nice to look at.

Holosuite Kira with Quark's head? Mmm Herrmm, you betcha.

So let's take a moment and appreciate this aspect of Star Trek people tend to tip toe around or simply overlook.

Sex and nice looking bodies / people / aliens have always been a part of the shows.

60,“Beyond The Farthest Star” - First Time Viewing Reaction,1596023803,"Noob Trek 80 - Beyond The Farthest Star

And so I begin my first time viewing of the Star Trek animated series. Now this is the most rasa of tabulas for me because this is the one Trek show I knew NOTHING about before beginning the marathon. All the others I had some inkling of their characters and premise, whereas I literally did not know TAS existed - I’d never seen a single reference to it. This led me to suspect that it must be garbage or not canon, so I decided I’d skip it, to which million of voices (well, five people on this reddit) screamed out in horror, saying it is canon and is actually quite good. We’ll see - it’s 22 half hour episodes so it’ll only take the time it took me to see 11 episodes of TOS. Hence, if I do end up detesting it, it’ll be over pretty quickly anyway.

So, it’s 1973 and TOS has been off the air for years but is doing really well in repeats. (I’m reading Marvel comics from 1970 and the ads have regular postings for Star Trek fan activities and merchandise. That‘s pretty good for a dead show.) Roddenberry, looking for a more cost effective way to make good on the show’s popularity, decides to do an animated version. (How do I know this if I’ve never seen it before? Because I read the comments on my 79 TOS posts and you guys love to tell me stories.)

Note: When I did my Doctor Who Marathon, I watched all of the missing episodes through “recons”, full length audio recordings of the episodes matched up with still photos intended to recreate what the lost shows might’ve looked like. I watched literally 100 of them. If I can do that I think I’ll be ok with this.

Anyway, off we go....

Oh dear. The introduction. Now it’s not the animation, although the animated storyboard approach isn’t the most impressive thing. It’s this godawful remix of the music with some of the corniest horns in existence before David Foster met Chicago. I have to clean out my ears, this is sacrilege, give me the beautiful 60s version anytime. Strange that I hate this so much as I’ve actually previously composed an essay about how 1973 was the best year music ever had, but maybe this is the kind of drek all that good stuff was reacting against. I don’t know if I want to hear this 22 times. Maybe it’ll wear me down.

Oh no, this is the meme animation Adult Swim style would frequently use for Sealab and suchlike. That’s going to make it hard to take this seriously. It’s great that they’ve got the original voice cast, although Kirk doesn’t look quite right and WHAT THE HELL IS THAT SITTING NEXT TO SULU? Do we ever get the backstory on how Jarjar Binks and ET had a baby that grew up and joined Starfleet?

The animation isn’t bad as such, I’ve seen much worse, it’s just stiff. Characters often feel frozen rather than fluid, breathing. Honestly the voice acting feels a bit stiff too. Again, it’s not \*bad\*, but with the exception of Nimoy whose character was intentionally stiff, and Doohan who seems to be trying, lines aren’t being delivered with the drama or emphasis they would have been in the live show. Here the crew seem pretty matter of fact about being dragged unwillingly across space.

OK whoever did the music needs shooting. These random horn blares that have no relationship to the onscreen drama are getting to me. Shame, as the scoring on TOS was pretty good.

Uhura sure has a pointy badge. Kirk’s sitting posture is bothering me too, as are the frequently recycled shots/frames. Brrr, I’ve just noticed the flesh eyes too. And the weird ass running where they hold their elbows above their shoulder level.

Oooh, the alien ship they encounter is actually really interestingly designed and pretty. And they’ve got “life support belts”, an improvement on beaming willy nilly into certain death as they used to do in TOS. This crazy ship is making up for how wooden the Enterprise scenes were. In fact it almost makes it seem like the beginning was dull on purpose, to create a contrast with the main action of the show. This has gone from 0 to 60 - I’m now filled with a sense of wonder, and thrilled about meeting the creatures that made this, especially when I realise this is an egg hatching nest. Despite the show’s technical limitations, it’s effective, I feel the same dread the crew must as they explore this astonishing dead place, not sure whether wonder or horror awaits them.

They go through a door and find themselves in a Jack Kirby laboratory. Aside from the over excitable music, the audio is actually really well designed.

What bizarre explosions. Cool design on the aliens though.

One phaser shot destroyed that entire ship?

The condensed running time makes Kirk more decisive - what seems to have been cut out of the show are the moments/dialogue where Kirk discusses or wonders what to do. Now he just spits out the orders.

Alien voice is silly. Reminds me of a Dalek a bit.

Kirk’s “And if I refuse” immediately before he gets sconed by a laser is hilarious.

I’m a bit disappointed that this has become another “random powerful evil entity” story. The ship scenes were leading me to expect something more original.

Creepy ending, though disappointing lack of aftermath. It has a similar arc to Wolf In The Fold, though is less exciting than that was.

So that was ok. You could see the seams in places, but it was not embarrassing and I was quite engaged in places. I think Trek probably does need 50 minutes to properly tell the tales it does, but there’s also something refreshing about getting a run of bite sized stories like this. It’s could that they’re using the affordances of the animated medium to be creative - I don’t think we’d ever get that nutty alien ship set on the live action show. I just hope that we see some similar creativity with the plots of upcoming shows, as the narrative here was a bit standard.",startrek,Kayfim20,False,/r/startrek/comments/hzzew7/beyond_the_farthest_star_first_time_viewing/
61,The United Federation of Planets is perhaps the best setting in all of science fiction.,1596022962,"This will be long, but I wanted to share one of the things I love most about Star Trek. With Star Trek Discovery Season 3 soon to drop, I wanted to take a moment and appreciate and explore just how unique and hopeful the United Federation of Planets is. Outside of some examples from literary science fiction, I can't think of many other works that look at humanity today say, ""we're going to do better than that, and we can do that, because it's in our nature"" and then imagine a world unequivocally improved on ours in every way. 

Briefly for context, it is far more common in sf to imagine the future as a place where the powerful forever force their boot on the necks' of the powerless. I don't even have to list them, you all know these stories by name; they're often taught in English classes as saying something truthful about our future: a warning of the dark heart at the rotten core of human nature. Even if these fictional futures aren't run by post-apocalyptic warlords or fascistic empires, they're at the best immensely corrupt ""democracies"" (or overrun with malevolent amoral megacorporations) with out-of-touch bureaucrats making distant decisions at the expense of their free people, injustices often ignored, covered-up, or perpetrated. 

So what does the Federation accomplish that is often treated as so routine and treated as matter-of-fact by its citizens (unless they're talking to outsiders) that you might not even notice during the course of a typical episode? 
- While the Federation is centered on Earth, humans aren't politically dominant. On the contrary there are 3 other founding member species (two of which spent decades on the brink of war before the UFP was founded) and by the time of PIC, it encompasses thousands of member worlds and just as many or more sapient species. TNG demonstrates that in order to join prospective members have to have accomplished several societal benchmarks (which I will lay-out in a later point). While the systemic mechanisms of its democracy are vague, it's fairly clear members and individuals can be guaranteed participation in an egalitarian system of diffused power.  
- Its antipathy towards civilizational enemies is not eternal; the Federation is far more interested in building alliances than grinding axes forever. Two examples are the Xindi and Klingons. The former, after their devastating genocidal attack on Earth, end up joining the Federation, and in spite of several brutal conflicts, the latter become close allies (with the implication that they will join the UFP later). 
- What are the societal benchmarks that a species has to dedicate itself to, and also become beneficiaries of, by being a member of the UFP? These include the eradication of poverty, homelessness, preventable illness, systemic racism, systemic sexism, and mass (and unjust) incarceration. The pyramidal power structures of economic disparity are thus rendered inert, and the bottom foundation of Maslow's hierarchy of needs is obliterated. Furthermore, it's implied that most of this is accomplished before the invention of the replicator; while special relativity might be an economic law by TNG, most of the above is the result of policies enacted in full by the time of DIS or TOS. 
- These policies (and replicators) make conspicuous consumption obsolete. If O'Brien wanted to get a gold Rolex or if Geordi LaForge wanted to buy a sweet Audi, no one would care; no one would be impressed. You could just replicate those no problem. Social capital must be accrued in other ways, for example Picard earning captaincy of the flagship, Worf winning a Bat'Leth tournament, or Tom Paris building and helming the Delta Flyer. Value, in a way, is determined by how much you better yourself or others. However one also does not ""lack"" value; there is no failure that results in your life being ruined. 
- These policies also dilute swaths of economic and generational trauma, leading to the types of well-adjusted (and ""boring"") characters typical to TNG/DS9/VOY. Without having to worry about their next meal or where they will sleep or what profession pays the most, people are free to pursue whatever skills or interests they want. People are free to work as much or as little as they want, and therefore have more time to dedicate to ""unprofitable"" but psychologically rewarding leisure activities, and forge healthy and fulfilling relationships with friends and family. With open borders within member states, citizens are free to move unopposed and build their best possible lives. Such existences absent want or need aren't dissimilar to the types of aristocratic environments (freed of time otherwise dedicated to labor) that cultivated historical ""geniuses"" in the past; imagine the civilizational power of diffusing that to every single individual.  

The Federation however, like all systems, is imperfect. It makes mistakes. The Maquis would likely disagree with many of the benefits I laid out. However, few of Star Trek's heroes would disagree with the philosophical core of their ire. On the contrary, it's often incumbent on the protagonists and individuals to hold the Federation accountable and demand it be better - that's true in each series thus far. It's that challenge and scrutiny that ensure that the Federation avoids the darker impulses inherent to systems and remains on the side of justice. 

Why is this valuable? I think fiction has the potential to inspire us and can warp reality around it if enough people believe in it. I think a lot of sf assumes the worst in people, and people watch or read it, shake their heads in disappointment and disgust, and think ""humans truly are the real monsters."" This in turn leads people to cynical inaction, or accepting the injustices of systems as natural. The Federation boldly proclaims the opposite; that people are mostly decent, and thoughtful, humane policies and systems can direct or embolden that decency. It in turn says something truthful about humanity that often gets overlooked; People are, for the most part, pretty good and try to do the right thing. This is mirrored in the antagonists; the ""enemies"" of the Federation tend to be systems full of individuals convinced they *are* doing the right thing.

And we've seen Trek inspire people before. It's good for us to see characters living out positive lives in as just a system that can be conjured as possible, in the same way that it's good that we see them use technology in helpful, non-detrimental ways. Trek makes the case that technology can cure all disease, automate labor, be our friends, and make people's lives better. In turn, people have been inspired to develop technology to improve lives in ways that are routine for us now. I think the Federation is that same aspirational goal, in the form of systems. There's no reason for it to serve any less of a blueprint than the communicator was in inspiring the cell phone. 

Is it realistic? I think studies suggest as much. There are real world theoretical policies that mirror what the Federation does. A Universal Basic Income is reminiscent of the Federation's lack of currency and providing for its citizens' every need. People don't starve because there isn't enough food, they starve because the system is unable to allocate enough food to them. The same is true of housing; in the USA, there are more empty homes than homeless people. That's a failure in allocation. Ensure that people are housed and that they have the basic income to feed and clothe themselves (studies show people use the houses as a base to find work and the excess income to improve their lives either materially or mentally), and you're well on your way to a civilization of happy, well-adjusted, boring nerds like in the TNG era.

So yeah, it's really cool we have this and that it's prospered in the public consciousness. That tons of creators and writers over several decades decided to collaboratively construct this future society. It's also just really cool that, for a genre so commonly fearful of making contact with alien civilizations, the future in Star Trek is one where humans (a species of social animals) use their main strength - being friendly - and venture forth to go out and make friends with thousands of alien species. It also shows us that part of the human adventure is building and crafting this world we can believe in; a Federation that each of us can contribute to every day. 

TL;DR The Federation is a beacon of hope for us in the real world. If we can follow its example, we could make realistic strides in improving the quality of life for all people.",startrek,the_c0nstable,False,/r/startrek/comments/hzz8i2/the_united_federation_of_planets_is_perhaps_the/

IRL, the reason why the same species looks different over the years is because of changing budgets as well as available special effects and makeup technology (the Saurians between TMP and DSC being the most obvious example or at least the one that inspired this post).

So in my head, the in-universe reason is that these are the same species, and different ethnic groups within that species. The Saurian from TMP is from one continent, while the one in DSC is from another and so on. 

There is zero evidence for this in Alpha-canon as far as I can recall, but that has been a headcanon explanation for this since I was old enough to notice the differences.

**Michael Burnham**  
central lead character in discovery, she is strong, smart, beautiful, has a couple of love interest and knows her stuff. Her only weakness is that she is a mary sue  
**Star Trek 2009 film reboot series**  
Nyota Uhura another smart, beautiful female led character, has a couple of love interests, dates Spock secretly and does her job well.  
**Raffaela Musiker from s=Star Trek Picard**  
Another strong second led black female character and more  interesting than Soji and her twin. she is one of the few characters in  Picard who actually had depth

Beckett Mariner  described the character as irreverent and someone who does not  follow the rules, though she is actually ""very good at all things  Starfleet, she just doesn’t care"" and has been demoted several times.

74,"Thanks to the Voyager finale ""Endgame"", Discovery S3 can truly have blank slate if it wants it.",1596010324,"We've seen two pieces of material that take place after Voyager returns home: Nemesis and Picard. These both take place in the altered timeline created by Admiral Janeway traveling back in time and getting Voyager home earlier than it otherwise would have.

Any glimpse of the future shown before that can be seen as having taken place in the original unaltered timeline in which Voyager takes several more decades to get home. This includes the Voyager episodes ""Futures End"" and ""Relativity"". More than that, we don't actually have a date for when the Doctor's back up module was lost in ""Living Witness"". Memory Alpha dates it at 2374, but the only thing that it's based on is Voyager's stated distance from home in the holographic recreation...but virtually everything about the recreation is shown to be wildly inaccurate. It could have easily been lost in the original post-Endgame future. Either way, it can be argued that the events were altered by Voyager's early return.

Additionally, while Enterprise obviously takes place well before Voyager it is truly meant to be a prequel. It could therefore be argued that any post-Picard future shown in it also takes place in the original, unaltered timeline.

Would Janeway's actions actually have changed any of this? Not necessarily. Is there any reason to believe that they specifically took place in the unaltered timeline? No. All I'm saying is that these could all reasonably have taken place in that timeline and therefore the writers and fans have the ability to easily explain away any potential continuity errors.

By that same token, if we use the Enterprise argument that even though the audience was shown the events AFTER Voyager that it is a true prequel and can be altered and retconned by the events of ""Endgame"" you could argue that the same is true for Discovery i.e. that the future we are to see in Discovery S3 is one that doesn't take into account events that ""haven't happened yet"". In this case, fans who may take issue with the depiction of that seemingly bleak future can have the headcanon that it would later be altered by time travel events in the 24th century.

As depressing as that is, I was thrilled when Discovery launched. Yes, I was skeptical, but by halfway through the season I could see where they were going and was fully on board.

Yes, Voyager had some real stinkers, but it was still a fun show, and at times highly enjoyable. One of the best episodes was ""Living Witness"" where a backup copy of the Doctor wakes up around 3074, fact checks some history books, hangs around for a few decades, then takes off towards the alpha quadrant. Let's peg that date at the year 3100 for the sake of conversation. The trip could take anywhere from a few years (Voyager was home 3 years later) to maybe 35 years (roughly 35k ly to Earth from there, given it's place in the season).

Discovery enters the Giant Swirling Toilet of Time in, what, 2257ish? To jump forward about 930 years. That puts us about 3187, roughly. They have a spore drive that there's no reason they can't continue to use, and we know they do because despite popping out 50k light years away in the beta quadrant, we know they go back to Federation territory because, well, we saw it in the trailers.

Seems to me the Doctor and Discovery could intersect quite easily in time and space with absolutely no stretches of the imagination necessary. In fact, it's entirely plausible if Discovery trips over a ""Starfleet Medical"" facility somewhere run by the Doctor who has been trying to rebuild and run a medical school for the past 30 or 40 years.

This is an important fact. The planet is mostly a desert planet, with jist enough resources to substain the population. So because of that, a resource they do have to exchange with other species is themselves. Not as slaves, but as mercenaries. 

Things probably changed if they have colonies or if they managed to terraform to a degree their main planet.

But still, what would be their relation to the rest of the galaxy? Would they be allowed into the Federation, and if so, how would it ve possible? What would they gain and what would the federation gain?

It seems at some point Star Trek tried to start being more like Star Wars in its space battles and I don't know if we are better for it.

37,Knowledge of the Augment virus and smooth headed Klingons outside the Empire?,1595919838,"So we know why TOS Klingons had smooth foreheads while TNG/DS9/VOY Klingons had the bumpy ridges. An episode of DS9 acknowledged the difference but didn’t give an explanation, and then a two parter episode of ENT gave us the official in universe explanation. Long story short, it was basically genetic engineering gone wrong.


When the TOS style Klingons are seen in the DS9 episode, Bashir and O’Brian are caught off guard and ask Worf what’s going on. Worf confirms they are indeed Klingons and that the reason why they look different isn’t discussed outside the Empire.

Here’s the thing, it’s understandable why the explanation for the lack of ridges would be obscure information outside the Empire, they did their best to keep it under wraps. However, I find it a little hard to believe that StarFleet or the general Federation public had absolutely no knowledge of this, especially, given that ridge-less Klingons were the only Klingons most non-Klingons encountered for about a hundred years.

You’d think the knowledge of ridge-less Klingons would be passed down in some way. At some point in that DS9 episode, Bashir or O’Brian could’ve said something along the lines of “I remember reading about this somewhere, there are accounts of more humanoid looking Klingons back in Kirk’s time, but no one is sure why”.


TL DR, to what extent was the Federation/Star Fleet aware of the Augment Virus and smooth headed Klingons in the years after ENT but before the TOS movies when forehead ridges started to appear again? Did non-Klingons from the TOS era pass their knowledge of ridge-less Klingons to relatives and friends who lived into the TNG era? At some point, did someone from later on in Kirk’s era who had seen ridge-less Klingons see ridged ones years later and say/think “Huh? That’s new?

54,Dukat and Garak,1595906072,"Has anyone noticed how Dukat’s and Garak’s arcs are actually mirrored? As Dukat falls, Garak rises. Let me explain:

Dukat: he starts off the series as someone akin to a fair weather friend to the DS9 crew. While they are mutually distrustful of each other due to his role during the Bajoran occupation, they often work together in the earlier seasons and sometimes have common interests. During the Klingon war it actually seemed like Dukat was aligning himself with the “good guys” of the show. That is until he takes over Cardassia and it just goes downhill from there. As Dukat gains more power, the mask begins to slip. When his daughter is murdered, he goes batshit. His true intentions begin to show and he is revealed to be a very unstable man who had everything and lost it, twice. A man who was going to be redeemed, and fell from grace. After becoming the Bajoran version of the Antichrist and fights Sisko, the man that in his eyes caused him to fall, he is cast into Bajoran hell. 

Garak: he starts off as a very suspicious “plain and simple” tailor. His true intentions are never really known. His background details are very muddy, why was he exiled from Cardassia? As he strikes up an unlikely friendship with Bashir, an man who he is practically in love with, we begin to learn more about his past. He is a former Obsidian order agent. His father is the head of the Obsidian order. The more we find out, the more we begin to suspect and mistrust him. Bashir, whether through naïveté or sheer curiosity, counties to “court” him in order to find out more. As the series progresses and the Federation is in dire straits, Garak proves to be an important figure. While his ways of doing things do not exactly align with Starfleet guidelines, Sisko realizes that this is a necessary evil. (Watch “in the pale moonlight” to see this at play) Fast forward to the fall of Cardassia. After almost being genocided into nonexistence, who is left to lead Cardassia? Garak. He ends up being the hero and actually is in the process of redemption as he no regular Cardassian. Much like Damar, he too realizes the faults of the Cardassian race and appears to understand that the next time must be different. He saw what happens when Cardassians go off the deep end. 

To sum up, Dukat is a former oppressor turned hero turned villain, only to become a deeply broken man turned demon who is cast to hell. Garak is a morally ambiguous spy, turned morally ambiguous actor doing things that which the means justify the ends, to ultimate savior of his race.

I've always felt that the placement of Dr Bashir I presume, A Simple Investigation, and Business as Usual right after Cardassia joined the Dominion was really odd. It seems like these episodes would have made more sense earlier in the season.

In season 3, after the Dominion was discovered traffic to the station was slow due to the threat. In season 5, right after Cardassia joins the Dominion, Dukat threatens Sisko, and they tried to destroy the entire Bajoran system, it's just ""Business as Usual.""  After all this, civilians from Earth (Bashir's parents) still go to the station and act like everything is normal.  A line from Bashir's mom or dad about how they were nervous because of the Dominion threat would have made sense. I think the only reference to the previous game-changing episode we get are some Klingons playing Dabo and perhaps some Klingon ships outside the station.

Also, in Business as Usual, why not throw in a line about how arms dealing has become more profitable due to the dominion threat?

People who express that opinion have a very myopic and incorrect view of the franchise imo.

It often means an attack on the franchise's recent lack of idealism, its darker tone or its love of adventure over the quieter cerebral tone of 90s Trek. As if Trek has always been nothing but some high minded Enlightenment exploration of the Human Spirit.

Star Trek TOS was often a silly comedy, episodes like ""A Piece of the Action"" in which a whole planet decides to become Chicago style gangsters because someone dropped off a noire novel.

TOS was also often just an adventure program, such as the amazing submarine battle film for television, ""A Balance of Terror.""

The episodes that we remember as the High Minded Exploration of the Human Spirit were actually a tiny minority of episodes. For every one ""Let This Be Your Last Battlefield"" there were two or three ""Sulu gets high and runs around the ship with a sword because Asians are like that.""

The show also had a fair number of bleak, almost horror episodes like ""Dagger of the Mind.""

My point is TOS was a very big tent in terms of tone and genre.

Even the High Minded Idealism was often deconstructed in Star Trek. DS9 was a seven season long attack on the franchise's humanism, how it gets a lot muddier the closer to real life emergencies you go. ""In the Pale Moonlight"" for example.

In short, hate the recent franchise if you like, but don't cheapen Star Trek by saying it is too small to tell bleaker, or more action based stories.

Simple, but discreet version of my question with a reference: Why would that ever be the first action or of a species when in contact with another alien race — whether or not it is a privilege, tradition, or a maybe a way of communication or understanding a species? Similar to how — in the Teen Titans back in the 2000's — Starfire's species Tamaran, needed to understand Dick Grayson when she first landed or crashed on Earth. She kissed him in order to understand Dick's Language. But reverting back to the topic, it could of been any kind of feature of Riker — despite the fact that there are occupations in the world of the Malconians — or perhaps the Enterprise, but that would violate the Prime Directive or about the universe.

- Physiology (If given the data): 

Why do you eat like that and why is your mouth there?

Why is your procreation unit between your legs?

What is wrong your fingers?

- Evolution - Clarification:

I'm curious on why they wouldn't request something else. Something of a question, such as questions about species they have encountered or advice when making the first space travel.

19,I think that Star Trek: Prodigy and Lower Decks are both fantastic ideas,1595822691,"I've been seeing a bit of hate towards the idea of a Star Trek show for kids, and a LOT of hate towards Lower Decks, so I want to stand up and defend them.

Lower Decks is a really good idea, from a franchise owner's perspective. A lot of people call Rick Berman out for his BS, but he was somewhat right about franchise fatigue. The average viewer doesn't want to watch 10 people go on the same weekly adventures for 20 years. Each of the 90s shows had a similar vibe. Lower Decks is completely different from anything done before in Trek history (except for TAS, of course). Changing up your show portfolio is a great idea for your franchise. Look at Star Wars, for example. They've had tons of differing media throughout the franchise's lifespan, and they're still going strong. The same should be done for Star Trek.

Prodigy is probably the best idea Trek has had in years. A kids show is exactly the spice that is needed to draw people in. Kids don't wanna watch long, boring (for them) speeches on soundstages. They want relatable characters, and something catered to them. Maybe Prodigy will be a show based in Starfleet Academy. School is always relatable for kids.

47,Thoughts on Deep Space 9,1595794506,"I finished binging Deep Space 9, prior to this I finished TOS, TNG, and all the movies (this year was my introduction to Star Trek and safe to say, I'm hooked) That said, since I just started Trek a year ago, I don't think I have to nostalgia goggles for it yet so I have to say DS9 was easily the best of the 3 shows I've watched. By like, by a considerable margin. I'm suprised I don't hear more about this show while TNG is so iconic. 

First of all the setting was amazing. The space station held several clashing and interesting factions of the Federation, Bajor, Cardassians, the Dominion, the Fergengi etc. There was so much tension and intrigue on. While I liked TNG, an issue I had with it was there was no real conflict on the Enterprise. TOS had McCoy and Spock at each other's throats, and Voyager has the Marcqui and Starfleet (sorta) at odds. Everyone on TNG got along perfectly fine 90% of the time minus maybe Doctor Pulasnki.

Next its easily the best cast I've seen in Trek. There's no real weak link. Sisko was great, tough as nails captain, Quark gave some color to the civilian section of DS9, Odo was great whenever he wasn't being emo af (sorry, he tested my patience a few times), Kira was a cool ex-terrorist the show (mostly) doesn't sugar coat. The secondary characters are amazing: Garak is my favorite character in maybe all of Trek and I really liked the Ferengi like Nog and Rom. Dukat, Weyoun, and Winn were great villains as well.

Also it managed to do more serious stuff while keeping to the core of the previous series: like we had the Dominion War, but we also got ""Trials and Tribbulations"", ""Take me out to the Holosuite"", that one Q episode, and ""Visitor"" 

Naturally I had a few issues with it: sometimes it was so pre-9/11 it hurt (like the characters throwing a fit over taking a blood sample to check for changelings. I didn't love Sisko being half prophet either. Also the ending kinda ripped off the end of Lord of the Rings (I guess the end of the books since Return of the King movie hadn't come out yet I think...)

But it's been fun re-watching the show with that in mind. Some of his earlier scenes make a lot more sense when you think of him as an augment.

- Maybe his love of ""real frontier medicine"" as he calls it was a chance to be far away from the Federation so he could be himself and attract less attention.

- Him famously missing out on being Valedictorian by 1 wrong question. Maybe he did that deliberately so he wouldn't get the attention? He knew Dr Lense would pick the position on the Lexington so he'd be free to go to DS9

- He turned down a chance to be chief of surgery at a hospital on Earth to go to DS9

- His enhanced Eye Hand coordination would have been helpful when he played raquetball, and explains in part why he was so good at it

I believe a couple episodes before the last ep of VOY, Neelix left, which as much as I had my up and downs with his character it was sad but I’m  definitely glad he went back with other Talaxians.

The last episode(s) was definitely interesting, I felt like it was weird how much Janeway changed, yes when Seven and Chakotay died it must’ve changed her but she went back on a lot of her beliefs. I just thought she was a little to “evil.” The last scenes when they destroyed the Borg sphere? (I forget what they call it) and came out after it exploded, I thought was extremely cool way of coming back. I’m also happy that they showed Tom and B’Elanna having their baby, definitely a heartfelt moment.

I was sad that they didn’t show what happened when they got back to Earth but I think it’s good that it leaves an uncertainty that the viewer can always think about. I think it’s better than a failed attempt of showing how their lives were after they got home. 

Thinking about it now, I did watch most of TOS with my dad when I was younger, I might’ve finished it but I don’t remember, I also watched a couple seasons of TNG with my dad when I was young; So I did have a bias going into Voyager but I think it was a good series for me to watch. 

I really enjoyed watching Voyager, it definitely will be one of my favorites. My dad and I just started watching Enterprise, to be exact an episode.

60,Can we all have a minute of silence for Star Trek? [Spoilers maybe],1595779739,"I hope I'm not the only one that feels this way.  


My Star Trek journey started with TOS and I absolutely loved it. TAS next, loved it. TNG next, loved it. Why did I love them? Because they represented hope, excitement, and had overall positive vibes. It's a trend in many scifi shows/movies to either show a dystopian future with a battered society or have a storyline with humanity in line for sure annihilation. Like a diamond in the rough, Star Trek was filled with optimism. Something to look forward to in the future - where Earth unites and wonderful things happen. Of course there are negative elements as well but the entire show was very well balanced.  


DS9 was 7 seasons leading up to just one thing. Thought the overall tone was slightly more negative, no other Star Trek show had such an amazing character development. You eventually start enjoying and appreciating each and every character on the show. On the other hand, Voyager was unbearable for me. Each of the characters was good individually but together they didn't really fit in. Of course, it's only my opinion. Though I enjoyed DS9, the next Star Trek show that got me ACTUALLY excited again was ENT. It had a nice pace and positive outlook with **natural feeling characters**. Too bad it was killed off prematurely.  


Now this is where the problem deepens - Discovery and Picard. Though they are great scifi shows, they're not necessarily great Star Trek shows. The whole outlook is sorta grim and they follow the **regular scifi formula**. Everything is always influenced by something negative and the main characters look constipated with a constant negative thought. Also, Discovery seems to suffer from the same problems Voyager does - some cocky main character who's always impulsive and somehow manages to get their way all the time. Especially the first officer in Discovery.  


Anyway, I think we need another Star Trek show that sticks to its positive core - space exploration and the excitement of the unknown. I believe we need another 5 year mission of hope.",startrek,thesonofel,False,/r/startrek/comments/hy9htu/can_we_all_have_a_minute_of_silence_for_star_trek/

For anyone who doesn’t know/care what I did, I watched TOS from the beginning in its entirety as a total noob. I had seen not a single full episode of any Star Trek prior to doing so, so I was a clean slate. I’m going to do this with the other series in chronological order as well.

Well, it certainly went out with a bang didn’t it? The bang of a punctured tire that is. A dreadfully sexist episode that is somehow simultaneously boring and ridiculous with a laugh out loud performance from Shatner, this certainly isn’t how anyone would want to remember the show. It’s not quite among the very worst episodes, but gosh it’s close.

It actually has quite a good cold opening that really wrong footed me and didn’t prepare me for the pain to follow at all. It’s interesting to get confirmation that Starfleet doesn’t allow female starship captains. That’s surprisingly backward for this show. Still, at least Kirk disagrees with it, and he’s usually very slow to criticise Starfleet. I recall that in The Enterprise Incident we saw a female Romulan captain, so it’s additionally interesting that Starfleet is shown as being behind the times compared to some other civilisations.

The Lester/Kirk old flame dynamic is nice, more believable than typical. I like how Kirk acknowledges that if he was paired with any woman strong enough to be a starship captain they’d kill each other, haha. But then we get the big twist of Lester’s betrayal and we’re not even at the credits. Didn’t see this coming. This is going to make for some interesting acting.

Oh crap, it’s my last chance to see if I can recite the TOS opening from memory. Ok, not looking anything up, it’s “Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise. Its five year mission... shit, I’m losing it, uh, its five year mission to boldly go forth to seek out strange new worlds, new life and new civilisations where no man has gone before.” That was awful, I’ve gotten worse since the last time I tried. (Lets intro play.) Man, how can I hear this 79 times and still get it wrong. I don’t care if I’ve seen all of TOS now, I still feel like I should turn in my fledgling Trekkie card.

Disappointed that Lester-Kirk never looks down the front of their trousers and starts giggling uncontrollably.

Whoa this is going off the rails fast with the strangulation scene. I quite liked the cold open but this getting dark and weird at warp speed. “It’s better to be dead than live alone in the body of a woman”? Holy shit, and it’s being said by a woman too. And why is Lester saving Kirk’s life right after trying to kill him? And what was that technology on the planet? I hold my arms up in front of my face to shield myself pieces of this episode start flying out of the TV as it barrels down the tracks shedding pistons.

I love how Shatner thinks “acting like a woman” means “acting like an utter lunatic, and terribly too.” ”Love? Him?” I had to pause the video to adjust to what I was seeing. This is Shatner’s worst performance yet, what a sad note to go out on. Well it would be sad if it wasn’t so hilarious, I’m roaring with laughter as Shatner turns the overacting up to 11 in both of the scenes where the transference breaks. I wonder if Shatner or the director are chiefly responsible for this interpretation. It’s a shame because Lester-Kirk being loony-tunes derails the dramatic arc of the narrative. Because Lester-Kirk is so implausible, everyone knows what’s going on and Kirk can just sit back and enjoy a coffee and chicken sandwich while Lester-Kirk sets herself on fire.

BTW, why the fuck is Lester doing captain’s logs that acknowledge the deceit? And I’ve gotta love how the call sign of having a female mind is ”Emotional instability and erratic mental attitudes.” I’d be dismayed to see a show made years prior going with these lines. On the bright side, at least Smith is doing a good job with what’s she’s been given. The script might be letting her down, but ironically she’s doing a much better job at acting here than Shatner is. Cool reference to The Tholian Web too.

So being female is a mental illness? And what was Lester’s endgame btw? She’d become captain of the Enterprise and... that’s it? Just hope no one suspects anything despite your making no attempt to imitate Kirk’s mannerisms? And what was in it for Coleman? He’d get to bang William Shatner? It’s not very well fleshed out. 

Sudden shift to another court martial scene is odd, it doesn’t feel dramatically correct. And speaking of dramatically incorrect, what about Smith’s court martial pants. Kirk couldn’t stay with Lester because of her intense hatred of her own womanhood? “Red faced hysteria” means Kirk is a woman? And where is this coming from anyway, we‘ve had decent strong female characters on the show before, why are we suddenly throwing a gender under the bus? Speaking of which, where is Uhura? Wouldn't blame her if she sat this one out.

What is general order four? Shame we don’t see any execution prep, I’m kind of curious to see how they’d do an execution. Does it come up in any future Trek? I also like how they keep four conspirators in a single cell the size of a toilet stall, and I’ve just noticed there’s a chocolate cake in a display case in the lab. And the transference is broken by tantrums?

Aiyaiyai. And I haven’t even mentioned the mass murder, or the lack of consequences for Coleman and Lester.

“Her life could have been as fulfilling as any woman’s... not as fulfilling as mine, obviously...”

You know what, maybe this is one of the worst episodes of TOS. It wasn’t as howlingly awful as For The Romance Is Shallow And I Just Met This Guy but it left a bad taste in my mouth. I think the weight of it being the last episode pressures us to expect more, and while it may be unfair to do that, psychologically it’s unavoidable. A loud proud wet fart and an ignominious end to a great series.

But not Noob Trek! No that shall continue! I’m off to start a “I watched all of TOS and all I got was this lousy 1k Karma“ AMA thread on the reddit, because by public demand (1 guy) it was requested that I do something like this as a recap/summary of the first stage of the journey. After that, the animated series awaits, which I really don’t know about, but we’ll see. Can’t be worse than this.

&amp;#x200B;

...

&amp;#x200B;

**Authors note:**

As a long-time fan, I was excited as anyone to see Riker in the Captain's chair in the last episode of Star Trek: Picard. But I couldn't help wonder: how would the the crew of the *USS Zheng He* (""the toughest, fastest, most powerful ship Starfleet ever put into service"") feel about being assigned a new captain on a whim? So I wrote a short story about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

...

&amp;#x200B;

**""Zheng He"" - A Star Trek: Picard Short Story**

&amp;#x200B;

“Captain’s log; Stardate 7625.4; *USS Zheng He*.”

“Today marks my third anniversary as commander of this vessel. On this occasion, it is only fitting to record that the ship and its crew have served Starfleet with distinction.”

“Earlier this morning, we initiated first-contact procedures with the Iurgians, the inhabitants of the third planet of the Novalis system, inside the former Neutral Zone between the Federation and the Romulan Empire. However, I have since received new orders from the CNC and have asked my senior officers to assemble so I can relay them.”

Captain Fatema Basu turned her chair at the head of the table in the *Zheng He*’s senior-staff conference room to have a better view through the transparent-aluminum windows along the room’s starboard wall. The lower half of the panorama was taken up by the Iurgian homeworld, the turquoise ocean of its Northern hemisphere visible in patches through the cloud cover. The upper half showed the space beyond, a black curtain penetrated only by the occasional flicker of distant stars. Basu’s gaze instinctively sought the mid-point, where the planet’s ionosphere melted into the black. Through the atmospheric mist, she could just about make out the outline of the planet’s second moon.

She slumped back in her chair and straightened her uniform jacket with a brisk tug of its hem, a gesture her officers would have known to interpret as a sign of tension. But for now, Basu was alone in the room. She was bracing herself for an uncomfortable meeting.

The muffled sound of approaching voices alerted her to the first arrivals moments before the conference-room doors wooshed open. Her first officer, Commander Themba Radebe entered, apparently in animated conversation with Lt. Commander T’Pring, the *Zheng He*’s science officer. They had clearly expected to find the room empty. When they saw their captain already seated at the far end of conference table, they abruptly fell silent and stiffened visibly.

“Captain.” Radebe nodded formally. Basu thought she detected the slightest hint of an irreverent sparkle in his eyes. She had known Radebe since he joined the Academy as a freshman during her senior year. As cadets, they had struck up a superficial friendship over their shared love of Parrises squares. As officers serving on the same ship, their bond had evolved into something much closer. Three years in, Basu often felt she could read Radebe like a Betazoid, and he seemed to have developed similar telepathic skills when it came to her. They had already used this tactical asset to their advantage in several sticky situations.

Lately, Basu had started to wonder whether Radebe and T’Pring where sleeping together. T’Pring was your typical Vulcan scientist: controlled, logical to a fault, and with a sense of humor deployed as rarely and as precisely as phaser fire from a Suurok-class light cruiser. If you weren’t paying attention, you could easily miss it all together. Basu had noticed that over the past months T’Pring had let her hair grow from its original bowl cut into shoulder-length bangs. To the best of the captain’s recollection, the transformation had begun shortly after a shuttle crash had stranded Radebe and T’Pring in the Breen arctic for a week.

Sexual relationships between serving officers on a starship were neither uncommon nor taboo. But if Radebe and T’Pring had become more than colleagues and friends, they had done well to hide it from the rest of the crew. It was considered good form for senior officers not to provide fodder for gossip on the Lower Decks.

“Number One. Commander T’Pring.” Basu gestured for them to get settled in, and they hastily took their seats at the table – he to Basu’s right, and she to the captain’s left. “Report?”

“Our first meeting with the Iurgian delegation went smoothly,” Radebe began. “It is a pity you couldn’t accompany us. The Iurgians have evolved in near-perfect symbiosis with their underwater habitat. Our host city has naturally grown out of coral to form a structure three times the size the Earth’s Great Barrier Reef. The dive into the Central District is… nothing short of spectacular.”

Basu was about to make a disparaging remark about Starfleet protocol concerning the captain’s involvement in away missions when the door wooshed open once again. Lieutenant Torak entered, followed by Doctor Dietrich. The two nodded a greeting and took their seats at the conference table.

Torak was a Cardassian, one of the cohort of young officers that had made their careers under the new civilian government. He was an avowed humanophile, and enjoyed boring his crewmates with his encyclopedic knowledge of early 21st century Earth literature. Knausgaard was one of his favorites. Torak had asked for, and been granted, a permanent secondment to Starfleet. He served the *Zheng He* as tactical officer.

Hildegard Dietrich was an old-school army doctor. She had started her career as a field medic during the brief Federation-Klingon War of 2372, re-attaching limbs while covering from disruptor fire. During the Dominion War, she had received countless decorations for valor. But she was uncharacteristically tight-lipped about this part of her personal history. In all other contexts, she enjoyed the dubious distinction of being the bluntest person in the room – notwithstanding the fact that there was generally a Cardassian present.

“Commander Radebe was just briefing me on the first meeting with the Iurgian delegation,” explained Basu. “Please continue, Number One.”

“As I mentioned, we received a warm reception from the delegation and the meeting went well. However, the Iurgians have made an unusual request.” Radebe paused. “Iurgian society is organized in loosely federated city states, without a central government. The delegation we met represents approximately half of these city states. They would like to commence accession talks with the Federation at the earliest opportunity.”

Basu arched an eyebrow. “What about the other city states?”

T’Pring and Radebe exchanged meaningful glances. “They do not wish to seek diplomatic relationships with off-worlders.” Radebe finally said.

“Let me get this straight,” Basu folded her small hands on the conference table. “Half the planet wants to join the Federation as soon as possible – and the other half wants nothing to do with us?”

“Correct.” Radebe nodded.

“That’s unusual.”

“Highly unusual, Captain.” T’Pring confirmed. “Psychohistorical studies show that there are broadly two archetypes of pre-warp societies. Those with persistent national, religious and ethnic cleavages that ultimately hasten a distinction-level event. And those that eventually become warp-capable. Societies in the latter group almost universally unite behind a common planetary purpose around the time they develop warp drive. The most prevalent theory for why we observe this empirical regularity is known as the Kessler Conjecture: the scientific and societal efforts necessary to foster the development of warp drive are so great that a planet can only shoulder them if, at a minimum, the seeds of planetary unification have already been sowed.”

“The Iurgians have developed warp drive,” T’Pring continued. “But the different Iurgian city states clearly have a very different vision for the future of their cultural development. To borrow a human phrase, the Iurgians are ‘the exception that proves the rule’.”

“Fascinating!” Torak exclaimed, clearly delighted by the use of a human idiom. “What is the nature of relations between the different city states? Are there diplomatic or military tensions?”

“None we are aware of.” Radebe stated, turning to the Cardassian. “The Iurgian city states are all connected through a complex web of bilateral treaties and deep commercial ties. They are mutually aware of differences in certain… fundamental values. But they are equally aware of their interdependencies. You could say that they have found a way to interact fruitfully with one another from a respectful distance.”

“But this is preposterous!” Dietrich burst out. “If what you say is true, Commander, we cannot admit half of these city states into the Federation. It would inadvertently spread off-world technology and culture to the other half, which is precisely what their citizens are seeking to avoid.”

“What are you suggesting, Doctor?” Radebe asked, taken aback. “That we deny billions of people the benefits of Federation membership only because there are a few corners of their planet that don’t trust off-worlders?”

“Starfleet General Orders are of no help in this situation, Captain.” T’Pring stated coolly. “The circumstances are so unusual that there is no relevant rule on the books. We face a conundrum.”

All eyes turned to Basu, who nodded slowly. “I agree, Commander. It is a conundrum – and I sincerely wish we were able to explore it further.” She took a deep breath. “Unfortunately, I have assembled you here to inform you that we have received new orders from Starfleet. The *Zheng He* is being redeployed.”

“Redeployed?” Radebe’s eyes widened.

“Starfleet has received a distress call from the Ghulion system. We are to report there immediately.”

“I see.” T’Pring cocked her head. “I assume we are the only ship in range?”

“Not quite.” said Basu, gazing at a holo pad in front of her to avoid the Vulcan’s probing eyes. “Starfleet is rerouting two hundred ships to Ghulion. All of them will be *Inquiry*\-class, or of similar specifications.”

“Two hundred ships?” Torak repeated in astonishment. “This must the largest fleet deployment by Starfleet since the end of the Dominion War! Why?”

“I am not certain.” Basu looked up from her pad. “Admiral Clancy’s message was very brief. But I understand the small population of the fourth planet of the Ghulion system is under threat from a similarly sized fleet of Romulan warbirds.”

She paused to let the information sink in.

“How the hell did the Romulans build up such a large fleet?” Radebe asked at last. “The core of their Empire was crippled by the supernova. Many Romulans are refugees, scattered across the system. Rumor is that there are former Romulan senators eking out a meagre living on barely terraformed planets. The whole reason the Neutral Zone collapsed is that the Empire no longer possesses the resources to patrol the perimeter!”

“A very good question, Number One.” Basu rubbed her brow absent-mindedly. “It doesn’t make much sense to me either. But I am sure we will find out the answer eventually. For now, we have a rescue mission at our hands.”

Radebe nodded, and tapped his communicator badge. “Radebe to helm. Lay in a course…”

Basu gently touched his arm. “There is one more thing.”

“Helm, belay that order.”

*Here it comes*, Basu thought. “We have been asked to stop off at the Planet Nepenthe.”

T’Pring raised both eyebrows. “A trip to Nepenthe implies a significant detour on our route to the Ghulion system.”

“I’m aware of this – thank you, Commander. Our orders are to pick up Captain William T. Riker, who currently resides on Nepenthe.”

Radebe thoughtfully stroked his shaven head. “The name sounds familiar.”

“As I recall, he once stole a Starfleet warship to wage a private war on Cardassia for the Marquis.” Torak volunteered.

“No,” Basu shook her head. “I believe you are thinking of a… close relation. Captain Riker used to command the *USS Titan*. To all intents and purposes, he has been retired for the past ten years. But he remains on active reserve duty.”

“I’ve heard of Riker.” Dietrich interjected. “Admiral Shelby occasionally talked about him while we served together. Apparently, he was seen as a bit of a hotshot in his youth: great things in his future, and all that. But he plateaued. Spent almost 20 years as an executive officer, mostly under Picard on the *USS Enterprise*. Shelby said he just got too comfortable there. Dithered over three opportunities to get a command of his own, and turned down all of them. When he did finally become captain of the *USS Titan*, he held the position for barely a decade. Something about his family.”

Radebe shrugged. “There is nothing wrong with prioritizing family over your career. But why is Riker crucial to the rescue mission?”

“Captain Riker will assume command of the *Zheng He* and the deployed fleet for the duration of the mission.” Basu watched calmly as her officers exchanged baffled looks.

Radebe was the first to speak. “But Captain, he hasn’t commanded a starship for nearly ten years.”

“Moreover, the *Zheng He* is a brand-new ship. Its warp drive and weapons systems are at the frontier of Starfleet technology.” Had T’Pring not been a Vulcan, Basu would have sworn there was hint of irritation in the Commander’s voice. “Captain Riker is unlikely to be familiar with its tactical capabilities.”

“Does he have any privileged information pertinent to the mission?” Torak asked.

Basu sat back in her chair. “Not that I am aware. But he has specifically requested this assignment, and the CNC has granted it.”

A frown appeared of Commander Radebe’s brow. “What about you, Captain? What will be your role while Captain Riker is on board?”

“For the duration of the mission, I will act as Captain Riker’s executive officer.”

Torak made an astonished noise. “Even a temporary demotion like this would be considered a deep personal humiliation for a senior officer in the Cardassian military.”

“Thank you, Lieutenant, for this perspective.” Basu immediately regretted the sarcasm that had crept into her reply.

“I have to agree with Lieutenant Torak.” Radebe said hotly. “I struggle to see why Captain Riker is relevant to this mission, or how he is qualified to lead it. You have commanded this ship for three years! You know its systems inside-out. Heck, you helped design some of them during your stint at Utopia Planitia!”

“And the crew trusts and respects you, Captain.” Dietrich added.

“Besides,” T’Pring intervened, “You have a reputation with the Romulans since the provision Pro-Consul awarded you the Sotarek Citation. You are the *logical* choice to confront them the Ghulion system.”

“This is not up for discussion.” Basu said sharply. Although she was the second-youngest person in the room after Radebe, and at 160 centimeters by far the smallest, her training, experience and a natural maturity had endowed her with a unique command presence. She was deploying all of it now. “We have received our orders, and we will follow them. Captain Riker is a decorated fellow officer, and we will do our utmost to make him feel welcome and help him settle into his role.”

Her officers had fallen silent.

“Are there any further questions?”

“No, ma’am,” they responded, almost in unison.

“Good.” Basu straightened up. “Lieutenant Torak, please relay our orders to the helm. Commander T’Pring, I would like all information about the Ghulion system on my desk by 1600 hours. Doctor Dietrich, please put sickbay on standby: there may be casualties.”

There was a general commotion as her officers rose from their seats and shuffled out of the room to fulfil their orders. Only Radebe lingered in the doorframe.

“It isn’t right, Fatema,” he said. “You graduated top of your class from the academy. Youngest Starfleet Captain since James Kirk. You earned this command. Only in the time we have served together, you’ve saved the CNC’s bacon on at least three occasions.”

“Thank you, Number One,” Basu smiled weakly, “but I don’t require a recap of my service record.”

“You shouldn’t have to babysit a retiree who wants to play Captain one more time.”

“Themba,” Basu said softly, “let it go.”

He shrugged his shoulders and turned.

“One more thing, Number One.”

Radebe turned on the doorstep to see his captain once more intently focused on her holo pad.

“Captain Riker has sent me a personal message ahead of our rendezvous. He requests for the ship to be put on a three-shift rotation in time for his arrival.”

Radebe rolled his eyes. “No one has run a three-shift rotation on a Starfleet vessel since I graduated from the academy…”

Basu raised her eyebrows in admonishment.

“Aye aye, ma’am.” And with this, Basu had the room to herself again.

She slowly rose from her chair, clasped her hands behind her back and stepped closer to the window. The Iurgian second moon had now almost fully emerged from behind the planet.

Although she couldn’t admit it, Basu shared her officers’ unease. It wasn’t so much that her pride had taken a knock. But there was something altogether strange about this rescue mission. The vast Romulan fleet whose existence no one could explained. The staggering number of Starfleet ships that were being diverted from their essential humanitarian, peace-keeping and scientific missions on a whim. The retired captain who was being handed her command codes. The message from Admiral Clancy that had been composed in a distinctly late-20th century vernacular. Viewed uncharitably, it gave the impression of a top brass that had lost the plot and was trying desperately to please a few old boys while engaging in vanity fleet operations to show off their latest tech.

*Perhaps it is only human*, Basu thought. In any organization as large and long-lived as Starfleet, senior leadership was liable to lose its way at times. How fortunate then that Starfleet was more than a handful of men and women in a Californian office block. Its true strength and impact had always derived from its officers on the ground, from the brave souls of all species and genders who boldly carried the flame of Federation values into every corner of the galaxy. They were the face of the Starfleet, and the arbiters of its ideals on strange new worlds. And for any common enterprise, these ideals remained the soundest bedrock that had been discovered in nearly two and half centuries of space exploration.

Basu smiled as she recalled the words committed to the Change inscription by Admiral Zheng He, on the eve of his seventh grand voyage in 1431. “If men serve their prince with utmost loyalty there is nothing they cannot do, and if they worship the gods with utmost sincerity there is no prayer that will not be answered.” Starfleet’s prince was the Federation, a democratic union of species dedicated to peaceful coexistence, justice and infinite diversity in infinite combinations. Its gods were scientific truth, professionalism and self-betterment. These ideals were sound enough to withstand a few poor decisions at the top.

She turned towards the door to take her place on the bridge. As she walked, the *Zheng He*’s impulse engines hummed into action. Under their power, five million metric tons of tritanium and duranium slowly gathered speed, taking the ship out of orbit, and thrusting it towards Tomorrow.",startrek,CptRobertApril,False,/r/startrek/comments/hy5iik/zheng_he_a_star_trek_picard_short_story/

11,A thought I had regarding the DIS era Klingons.,1595703260,"So we know about the augment virus that caused the head ridges of many Klingons to vanish, leading to the version we see in the original series. And when Discovery came out their appearance was a big point of contention. But I think it presents an interesting story opportunity.

So the easy explanation is that there were Klingons who weren't affected by this virus. But why are there absolutely none like that in Discovery? Well I think discrimination may have had a part to play. After all, in Enterprise, the High Council opted to kill off the infected by force. And once the cure for it was distributed, I feel like it was a likely source of ridicule and probably put them in a lower social standing. Most of the Klingons we see have a fair degree of social standing and thus under this theory TOS Klingons would ever come close to those positions.

So why do they become so common in TOS then? I say a shift in the balance of power. The smooth Klingons, tired of the years of discrimination, start making some noise/forcefully taking their place in the high ranking positions. This could also be the cause of the sudden shift in culture we see. And then by the time of the motion picture, either a proper cure  was found or the balance of power shifted again. Or perhaps some of both.

So when it comes to the American frontier and Cowboys and Indians, Troi actually is the crew's expert! Suddenly her knowledge in Journey's End made sense as a subtle callback and character detail.

28,“All Our Yesterdays” - First Time Viewing Reaction,1595677516,"Noob Trek 78 - All Our Yesterdays

An interesting character piece with a plot that doesn’t quite hang together, as well as something of a callback to City On The Edge Of Tomorrow only with Spock as the focus, All Our Yesterdays features a range of engaging performances and intriguing ideas, yet didn’t quite thrill me the way it seems to do others.

There certainly are plenty of cool concepts straight off the bat. The cloned librarian is an interesting idea. The budget conscious way they stage it so that you only see one Atoz (A to Z? Get it? At the library? A to Z? Get it? Do ya get it?) is a little disappointing though, I would have liked to see a swarm of Atozs. (I know they had this facility, as we got multi-Kirks in Whom The Gods Destroy.) It’s still executed cutely, and I like how actor Wolfe performs differently when he’s the real Atoz. It was also neat when I realised that it was a library of actual historical times and locations you could go to. The science here is very wobbly/vague - how exactly this is done, the gubbins about needing your brain patterns altered lest being in another time somehow destroy you, the thing about how angry Vulcans existing 5000 years ago make Spock sympathetically angry, etc. - but I forgive it because it’s interesting. But you do think a society capable of this technology would, I dunno, just build a ship and flee the planet before it explodes. Also, won’t all these little simulations stop after the explosion anyway, making this pointless? Unless the machine ACTUALLY opens portals to these places but that makes it the most incredible piece of technology in the show ever and Kirk barely seems interested in it. Also, the title All OUR Yesterdays initially made me think that the machine would throw them back into their personal histories which I was excited by, but obviously the episode goes in a different direction.

There’s a lot of effort put into the 17th century setting, from the sets and costumes to Anna Morrow’s perhaps over-enthusiastic accent. The same is true too of the ice age set which looks pretty good, compensating somewhat for the sparse, faintly dull-looking library. Kermit Murdock has an odd but entertaining turn as a... judge? Lawyer? I liked him anyway. Our other star is Mariette Hartley (who, interestingly, would go on to found the American Suicide Prevention Foundation). She’s not a great actress, though she does grow on me - I take the fifth on whether the moment when she takes the big fur cloak off had anything to do with it. She’s enthusiastic at least, which is something of a theme of the episode, as this an episode with quite a lot of emoting in the script, and the cast is game.

The parallel action where our separated characters share audio but not location is different, though problematic to explain. I felt for poor dying McCoy in the snow. He shares a touching scene with Spock where he tries to sacrifice himself to give the Vulcan a chance to live but Spock won’t have it. Despite their bickering, they are dear friends. The episode is clever to include this moment, because the friendship’s testing later on when Spock turns will be a key moment in the dramatic arc. Also, Spock’s frostbitten ears are a nice touch, and Kelley looks like Bea Arthur when he lies down.

The episode is a bit slow, with scenes like the romance between Spock and whoops I forget her name - Zarathustra or Zoroastrian or Zara Larsson, yes that’s it - anyway, the romance between Spock and Zarabeth drags. It’s not badly acted or written, it just goes on too long and it’s another in a string of incidents this season where the babe of the week falls head over heels for a protagonist for no reason whatsoever. They could‘ve spent some of that lovey dovey time justifying the lovey dovey stuff rather than just wallowing in it. However, interesting that it’s Spock who pulls again this time, so at least it’s less monotonous than the early days of the show where it was Kirk week in and week out.

Its cute how the woman hears Kirk call his familiar spirit “Bones”.

”You make it sound like an equation!” “Well it should be an equation!” says Spock, vexed at his inability to decide between his duty to the Enterprise and saving McCoy. This exchange is a great insight into his character, and it’s a good episode for Spock and Nimoy, somewhat atoning for the indignities of Spock’s Brain. We get the interesting aside that Vulcans are vegetarian (I didn’t know that - was this established before?) which makes sense given their peaceful, empathic nature. But Nimoy acts Spock’s gradual transition to psycho very well here. At first I thought he was just being badly written, but then the line about “being prepared” echoed in my mind and I went “ohhh”. When he says “Get this through your head” and squares off with McCoy, Spock drips with menace and we are subtly reminded of how physically powerful Spock is - McCoy wouldn’t stand a chance. Which makes the scene with the rare sight of McCoy snarling and giving Spock a sincere, not humorous, tongue-lashing even more bold on McCoy’s part. Kelley does it well, the lines dripping with acid.

Meanwhile I was telling myself a more interesting story in which Atoz is a bad guy, sending and sealing the inhabitants of the planet to their fate so that he alone can control the portal machine. Or perhaps he is in fact the mysterious tyrant Zorkon that is mentioned several times, but in a really peculiar piece of writing, is never sighted or dealt with. What’s going on there? It‘s so odd for a story like this to establish a villain and then just never deal with him in any way.

At least we get the clip of Kirk on the trolley being wheeled into the portal, another out of context classic.

I found the ending very anti-climactic. There’s no twist or reveal or action. Kirk opens the portal, Spock and McCoy go through it. Now, while the “five thousand years ago” line is poignantly delivered, I’m not sure it’s well written. Isn’t she alive in parallel in a simulation? Wasn’t that the point of the exodus through the portals? Why wasn’t the history of the planet altered if they were genuinely sending people willy nilly into the planets actual past? We also get what must be the most abrupt ending in the series thus far. I dunno, there’s a lot of good things going on in this episode, but a tv episode is at its heart a story telling endeavour and there’s something off about the story here. Dont get me wrong, it’s not terrible, I quite liked it, but it didn’t have the cohesion or the payoff I was hoping for.",startrek,Kayfim20,False,/r/startrek/comments/hxleyp/all_our_yesterdays_first_time_viewing_reaction/

46,On Star Trek as escapism,1595656942,"I was on my DS9 rewatching span, something that I do occasionally with Star Trek series to keep my mind at ease.
And I got to the It’s Only A Paper Moon episode in the last season. The One where Nog has a PTSD. 

What a powerful subtle peace of writing. I completely forgot how it had played out. Magnificent how the episodes you didn’t invest in fully the first time, grows on you later. 

The story is continuation of the bleak and severe episode about the defending the array on the far outpost. Representation of the casualties of war stylistically rare for the Star Trek franchise. Perfectly done by putting often comic relief Ferengi characters in the centre of the story. Great contrast, no laughs, straight drama on aftermath of the bloodshed. 

And then comes Nog’s story, as a traumatized 
idealist forced to meet with harsh reality. 
And all that him avoiding to leave the holosuite and face his fears made me think I’m doing the same thing here, just by watching the very episode. 
What a meta. Because it what is. Star Trek was always the perfect getaway to the optimistic future where humanity prevails on all of its ills. 
And revisiting it is like Nog playing the same song round and round lying in his bed.
But finally he ought to acknowledge that he hides from the real world and step down his save fantasy. 

And that is something every escapist should do eventually. Something I felt I should do by finishing the episode and turning off my pad and meet the real world. To work on that promising future we have in fantasy. To really live. 

Thats why I freaking love Star Trek. No matter how naive or idealistic it sometimes can be. But it always delivers the story hitting you in the right place when needed. It can be a therapy and escapism, but it also can be a real catharsis. 
Something I wish you all.

48,Let's give Star Trek: Lower Decks a chance.,1595650624,"I'm seeing a lot of negativity about the upcoming animated Star Trek: Lower Decks series, and I think it's important to at least wait until the show is out before we form an opinion. A lot of this is very vocal, and that's disheartening. We can be better.

For context, I'm a life-long Trek fan, and have watched all of everything there is. That is a lot of Trek. Yet, despite this, I'm more excited about Star Trek: Lower Decks than I have been about *any* other upcoming series in the entire franchise. For me, the series appeals to me greatly.

Rather than write a giant essay about it, I'd just like to outline my opinion as to why we should give it a chance:

- Star Trek: The Animated Series faced similar criticism about ""not being Trek"" and it is now a cult classic.
- Animation allows the creators to do things that otherwise destroy the budgets of classical shows, such as have regular non-human crewmen (Ensign Tendi) who would otherwise require full-body paint every day of filming.
- Every show is different, and every show brings something new to the table.
- Many shows have ""tried something different"" and had the fanbase crying that it had jumped the shark (Enterprise's Xindi arc, Seven of Nine's introduction, DS9's Dominion War arc, Gene Roddenberry leaving TNG and Riker growing the beard, etc). Yet in hindsight, many fans now consider these things improvements over what had come before. Even the absolute classic ""Best Of Both Worlds"" was met with a large amount of hesitation because it was the first time they had done a two-parter over a series finale. That is now considered the best of Trek.
- The show is more than just funny and animated; it is a view into a part of Starfleet regularly unseen. That, on its own, is worthy of investigation.
- Shows like The Orville (which I consider to be Trek with the serial numbers filed off) have shown that humour can not only gel well with serious stories, but enhance them; humourous series can still have insightful, relevant, extremely serious plotlines (""About A Girl"", ""All The World Is Birthday Cake"", ""Firestorm"", etc). I suspect Lower Decks will be no different.
- Infinite Diversity In Infinite Combinations. Not every fan can like every series. Some people hate Voyager, some love it, *and that is perfectly okay* because every series *is for someone*. Some people even think *Threshold* is a great episode, and there is nothing wrong with them having their wrong opinions.
- In these troubled times, some humour (even if it's not your thing) would be more than welcome.
- Often, a new series has ""early installment weirdness"" while it's still finding its feet. Most series have a weak first season (Discovery, TNG, Enterprise, DS9, etc). For shows like The Orville, and I presume Lower Decks will be no different, the show sometimes has to find its feet. Let's not make up our mind before we get a chance to see it.
- The show is a labour of love from a die-hard fan who *insisted* the show be canon or it would not be made. He's one of us. They even bought in Star Trek author David Mack to make sure that the series will fit into canon.
- ""Complaining about shows you don't watch"" (or in this case, shows that aren't even out yet!) is a fan tradition, but still. We can be better than that.

And finally, if you don't like it, you don't have to watch. This show is *explicitly* about the ""least important ship in the Federation"" and is *explicitly* about the nothing that happens in 99% of the fleet. They aren't going to be saving the Earth from being Borged, they aren't going to be leading the Second Romulan War, etc. If any series can be safely skipped, I'm presuming it will be this one.

I just think we should give the show a chance before making that determination.",startrek,DavidAdamsAuthor,False,/r/startrek/comments/hxgkg0/lets_give_star_trek_lower_decks_a_chance/

1 - I would like to know about the obsession with the word ""nacelle"" ... it's used VERY frequently, and if im not mistaken, it refers to the housing of an external storage space.. correct me if I'm wrong.  My question is - why do they use this word so often? Voyager always seems to take damage specifically on the nacelles.. it's a word I didn't know existed until watching voyager, but it comes up so often in the show that it confuses me. And if it's that vulnerable, why not engineer better nacelles?!

The second question I have pertains to the pronunciation of the word ""sensor""

2 - Often, it is pronounced SEN-ser, but some of the main characters (other than tuvok) will pronounce it sen-SOR once in a while. I've heard it a few times now and I don't understand why they would change their pronunciation of the word, but it absolutely happens several times throughout the series. Why would this happen?

So, now I'm a nurse in the USAF. I have had several patients with a disease many of you may have heard of. This particular patient, while asymptomatic, is projected to be in isolation for an extended period of time. When I entered the room in my full PPE, I noticed the patient watching ""The Office."" I asked him if he had any other shows in mind while he's in isolation, and he said ""no"", so I humbly suggested DS9 and the dude was said ""Is that the one with the Enterpise and the bald Captain?""

Me: ""Captain Picard? no, it's Commander Sisko of the space station, he later gets promoted to Captain""

Patient: ""I thought this show was about Picard and the Enterprise""

Me: ""No, that's TNG, but also Capt Kirk was the Captain in the original series. But before him there was Captain Archer in the prequel series Enterprise.  But then before Kirk was Capt of the Enterprise 1701, There was Capt Robert April, then Christopher Pike.  Then after the Enterprise A was decomissioned capt Harriman was the captian of the excelsior class Enterprise B, then the ambassador class Enterprise C was captained by Capt Rachel Garrett as seen in the TNG episode 'Yesterday's Enterprise' and the Capt Picard of the Ent D and E (galaxy and soverign classes, respectively).""

Patient: ""........ you know a lot about Star Trek, huh""

Me: ""Hahaha, yeah, I know more about star trek than nursing!""

I’m in my early 30’s and I was first introduced to Trek via TNG in the early 90’s.

My dad is a huge Trekkie having grown up watching TOS when he was a kid.

Any who, Star Trek has always provided a certain comfort for me.

Perhaps it’s because I didn’t really have a grandfather figure in my life as a kid, but I sort of always looked up to Captain Picard as sort of a surrogate grandfather, and the characters on TNG felt like a bit of extended family in a way.

I remember my brothers and I as kids used to build various Trek-inspired ships from Legos as kids, and used to pretend to be flying our own star ships.

And sitting down and watching Trek each week was always a nice bonding experience I got to share with my father.

And especially now with all the craziness going on in the world, it’s fun and cathartic being able to come here and just talk about Trek, talk about those various plot holes, weird idiosyncrasies, and other nerdy things we’ve thought about over the years, and even look back and reflect at how when rewatching Trek as adults, our perceptions have changed.

I’ll be the first to admit, it’s definitely a different experience viewing Trek through the lens of an adult as opposed to a child.

Anyhow, I know that I am relatively new here, but just wanted to express my appreciation.

I’ve had a very stressful week, and it’s been cathartic being able to participate in this sub. I just wanted to express my appreciation as I dip into my second ~~Romulan~~ Pale Ale.

When Janeway and her crew arrive in the delta quadrant one of the races they encounter are quite antagonistic. They give off a very space pirates vibe. They’re also fine with slavery and consider water a valuable resource(when we’ve seen whole asteroids made of ice irl?).

Anyway when the voyager crew give them what for one of these aliens is like “We’ll tell the whole quadrant about you!”

My question is this: Why did that work? They had so much trouble from a poor reputation in the early parts of the show because some backwards society of space pirates talked some shit.

If it were me and I was told 
“Hey you know those guys that regularly attack strangers for their stuff?”

“Yeah?”

“Well they’re going around telling people about this ship that did (presumably some atrocities)”

I’d have two reactions:

1. I’d very much like to meet this enemy of my enemy

2. Yeah these guys aren’t a good source of information, especially with a bias like that, why would I believe them?

What reason would Data have to not consent to sex? In fact, I imagine he would be quite enthusiastic about engaging in an activity so important to humans. I'm rewatching TNG and I can't help think that Crusher and Troi maybe sometimes when they're feeling a little lonely or horny, they give Data a booty call. That also goes for any off screen members of the crew.

EDIT: So, many of the responses are referring to the holodeck. So that I'm not repeating the same thing to every response, I just want to mention that sex with Data, a sentient being who would independently choose to have sex with you or not, would be a very different experience than whatever fantasy you can program in the holodeck. Holodeck simulations are, well, simulations who were programmed by you to consent to sex. You can program them as realistically as you want and create the chance of a rejection sure, but it's still not the same. A huge part of the pleasure of sex is that you're having it with someone who wants to have it with you. That whole idea of another person desiring to be naked with you and have orgasms with you is what sex is entirely built on for me anyway. This is what led to my question as crewmembers being interested in having a sexual experience with Data. Enquiring about his consent would also be completely devoid of awkwardness.

Through their music, they believed they could build a new Terran-Vulcan-Romulan civilisation free of the logic extremism of Vulcan and the dictatorship and imperialism of Romulus. John Lennon and Ringo Starr were Romulan, and Paul McArtney and George Harrison were Vulcan.

This project whithered with the break up of The Beatles and as the idealism of the '60s faded out and effectively ended with the assassination of John Lennon by the Tal Shiar.

* I can't match the font 1:1, but I tried to get as close to _spiritually_ possible with what I could find among free block fonts.

* I took some liberties with the species on display. But only in a couple places. Mostly because I had discrepancies between the names and the visuals. I found out a lot of them are incorrectly labelled (e.g. ""vulpes velox"" is a fox, but is represented by a lion).

He sucks so much, that because he's  in the federation he's a terrible Klingon, and because he wants to  retain his Klingonness he's terrible at being in Starfleet.  He  disgraced his whole family.  He's terrible at having a child, he's  terrible at love (perfect pairing though, Worf and Dax, great couple)  like remember when he made an ass out of himself on Risa?

Worf  sucks SO MUCH, his brother wanted to die and then he messed THAT up.

My question is how? It's explicitly stated that Terra Nova was 9 years away form Earth by Earth technology at the time. There's no indication the colony was that old when it was destroyed, and all contact happened over subspace. Clearly there were no regular cargo runs, otherwise somebody would have been on their way already to check on the colony, or a ship in orbit could have gone ""Hey, this asteroid is ganna hit the planet in a few years. Want us to help?""

For Terra Nova to believe Earth attacked them there would have had to have been a threat, and then for 9 years the argument over new settlers would have had to go unresolved and stayed in heated argument (otherwise Earth would have warned the colony or sent a Vulcan ship to stop the missile or whatever Terra Nova thinks they sent).

You may say warp speed had been improved so it would take less time. But in First Flight we learn an adult Archer's friend broke the warp 2 barrier 100 years after First Contact, and Travis's grandfather remembered when the colony was founded about 73 years prior to this episode. Also the distress call from Terra  Nova specifically requests a ""Vulcan ship"" be sent to save the children. Implying Earth has no ship that could reach Terra Nova in time to do anything.

Terra Nova is 20 light years from Earth, so a light speed weapon is even worse. How could anybody, let alone a sizable enough portion of adults to convince the children, believe Earth attacked the colony? Isn't it far more likely some other power, or even... idk... an asteroid impact, created this disaster? We know Earth has no weather control system in place yet (as Trip mentioned tornadoes in Florda a few episodes prior), so Earth likely had nothing to cause ""poison rain"" on another planet anyways.

33,Who's your pointless headcannon characters?,1595546004,"So occasionally, when watching an episode or movie, I'll notice something a little strange about an actor's performance or bit of scenery that I like to imagine a little bit about that character, and how that scene might have been profoundly impactful on the character's life without the intention of the main character's interaction. Occasionally, I'll give them names. 

For example, one character I think of every time I watch Insurrection is someone I named [Ensign Sonia Castro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAWjxTxVtU&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=251), whom happens to be deeply involved with another crew member on the Enterprise. That person? The chef de cuisine of the Enterprise galley, whom had been designing the meal for the reception for a new species to join the Federation - a highly prestigious engagement for a chef. Now, his girlfriend is about to call him and have him cut a major part of the meal because nobody bothered to tell him about the specific dietary needs of the people he would be feeding, hence, Sonia's reaction to Picard telling her to contact the galley and skip the fish course. 

Another that I love is Lieutenant JG Mark Davies, unseen at his post, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-8W0uTV19M&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=401). This unlucky son-of-a-bitch barely squeeked through the Academy. Never bad enough to throw out of the service, never good enough to secure a solid exploration gig on a starship. Several weeks ago, he finally had a good crew evaluation, having excelled at his most recent posting, night watch in the spacedock door control room, and he was informed that a posting aboard a starship as a security officer was being offered to him. Unfortunately, he decided to go out for Curry with his friends that evening, down on Earth in India in order to obtain authentic flavors in celebration of his promotion. What he didn't realize is that he had a nasty allergy to Ginger, which he would discover would cause him to violently void his bowels, causing him to run to waste extraction at the worst possible moment - the moment when Jim Kirk decided he would steal a starship out of Spacedock, something that had never been attempted before. Mark's dietary choice that evening would earn him a dressing down, demotion, and loss of his position he had been seeking for years, and causing him to take unimpressive, menial assignments for the rest of his career.

35,Highlights on Sharing TNG with Mom - #2,1595545075,"Hi everyone. I'm an old trekkor in his late 40's who recently took his old trekkie mom through The Next Generation while she healed from a medical calamity. These are our stories.

You can find Part One right here, if you like: [https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/hvz2f6/highlights\_on\_sharing\_tng\_with\_mom\_1\_encounter/](https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/hvz2f6/highlights_on_sharing_tng_with_mom_1_encounter/)

You know, people often remember the first two seasons of TNG as rougher seasons before she show really hit its stride, and that's true. The second season, in particular, was shortened due to the writers strike at the time. And the chemistry between the characters in the cast was upset when Dr. Crusher was replaced for the season by Dr. Polaski.

For my mom this was a troubling development and she wondered how Beverly could leave Wesley behind to be raised by, essentially, the rest of the crew. I didn't have a good answer, really, the show didn't either but gave it some lip service about a study program? It was a relief to her when Beverly returned in season 3, but in the meantime season two labored under character moments with Polaski that were just vexing: like her constant needling of data for being an android. Little work was done to make Dr. Pulaski likable to anyone, and thus, my mom didn't like her. She did recognize her from L.A. Law, however.

Yet the death of Tasha Yar and the departure of Dr. Crusher also meant that Deanna Troi would stand a bit more front and center for the season, and really for the remainder of the show. My mom, always one to share a frank opinion on the attractiveness someone on TV, was pleased. She found Marina Sirtis utterly beautiful and her character a delight throughout the run of the show. 

This makes a lot of sense. Sure, there's the fact that my mom is a woman and was just looking for the female characters to empathize with, and most of the others had dropped away by the start of season two. Marina commented herself about the departure of Denise Crosby and Gates McFadden at the time, and how it led to her stepping a bit more front-and-center as the ""sex symbol"" of the show (something she referred to with a proud laugh in the interview I saw). Her character was competent, and professional, yet eminently feminine. And she wasn't afraid to go ahead and be openly attractive.

Now, there's a lot of legitimate questions we ask these days about objectification and the male gaze. But my mom is and has always been a proponent of allowing the male gaze relatively unimpeded and allowing women to flaunt and be proud of, and in fact profit from, their beauty and sexual appeal. After her stint at college in the 60's watching original Star Trek, my mom spent much of the 70's as a Playboy bunny, living with Hugh Hefner in the mansion in Chicago. She met celebrities, shared a kiss with Elvis Presley, asked Sammy Davis Jr. to bus a table for her because she wouldn't wear her glasses while working (he graciously did so, she says, before a coworker pointed out her gaffe), and generally had a great a time living at the crest of the wave of an era of sexual liberation.

I think, to her, Deanna Troi represented the survival of sexy, feminine, feelings-focused women in the future, who are on-purpose feminine and feelings-focused, and valued and rewarded for that as part of the team. I for one share her hope for a future where woman have the whole range of choices available for whomever they want to be, including that!

Aaaanyway, this led to a lot more investment and fascination with episodes I largely snoozed through in the past, like The Child or Loud as a Whisper, which gave me a fresh eye on episodes with which I had long-since disengaged. The drama about possibly losing Will Riker in Shades of Grey affected her, whereas I had always just thought of it as ""the clip show."" The Troi/Riker relationship dynamic was to her liking throughout the series.

Data also remains a high point to her. She loves Brent Spiner's comedic talents, and so The Outrageous Okana was genuinely enjoyed while i was cringing at Joe Piscopo. It's kind of hard to believe that The Measure of a Man would come just six episodes later. Before that, The Schizoid Man made my mom ask, like I did, how it could take so long for everyone to notice Data was acting strangely. But Measure of a Man, as an episode, did solid work, not only in bringing the story of Data and what it means to be him to a more serious and thoughtful level, but also really securing the noble nature of the character of Jean-Luc Picard. Guinan was added this season, and her character deserves a lot of credit for giving the Picard character a non-subordinate sounding board he needed to flower as a character whose head we could finally see inside.

The Borg appeared, when Q reappeared. And Q Who is a masterpiece. I couldn't help but telegraph that an extra good one was coming, but nonetheless she sat raptured and watched it because of its own merits. Looking back, it really is the most pure and uncompromising version of the concept, directed with a radically different tone than most of the season, and scored by Ron Jones was such fantastic, spooky riffs. In some ways, Q Who is the high point of high concept Star Trek: The Next Generation. The only way to improve it, looking back, would be to make Ensign Sonia Gomez a casualty of the encounter, since the episode featured her so prominently only for he rto disappear from the guest character roster. Consistent in noticing and starting to care for female characters, my mom noticed her and started to care for her. Then she was gone, without reason. Q Who could have killed her and used that against us!

In general, as she was healing and becoming more consistently alert, my mom seemed to like TNG season 2 more than I remembered liking it, and I must admit there were definitely signs that the show was settling into its groove of how to pepper interesting character work among compelling episodic adventures. The poker game appeared and was welcome. The holodeck made its comeback and Professor Moriarty appeared, and my mom was plenty fascinated with him, making it a shame he'd take so long to return. Worf got a romantic interest, and my mom was happy for him. I was sad, knowing how that would turn out.

The season is a mixed bag but seeing it with fresh eyes brought out a lot of its merits. It laid a lot of solid groundwork, and had two of the best episodes out of the entire show. As a kid I was all about sci-fi concepts. At the time I really liked Time Squared, even though so little actually happened in the episode, whereas she found it kind of went nowhere. She really enjoyed The Icarus Factor and Riker hashing it out with his dad, which helped me appreciate that story arc more than I had before.

Off the couch, up and about a bit more, my mom healed as we continued. She relied on me to tell her which season we were on, such a contrast to waiting all summer for the next one to start! This would really work to her benefit next season with the cliffhanger!

In comparison to Picard, Janeway was never really the model Starfleet captain, and i don’t think she was meant to be. She was someone who was very flawed, and was dealt a very bad hand (in terms of, well, getting stuck 70 years from home). And she had to carry her feelings of personal loss, and her feelings of failure to her crew, while still trying to maintain the ship and get them home somehow. 

And, she makes a lot of mistakes, but I think that’s her character. That’s why she leaned so much on chakotay and tuvok - because they were able to maintain a sense of logic and calm that she knew she wasnt able to. She was very headstrong and sometimes rash. But, i always felt that she did the best she could for her crew, despite her own personal limitations. 

Plus, i always try to think of how I would act in her shoes. She is very obviously depressed in many of the episodes. Crew members die, they’re stranded with no concrete way home. She lost her fiancee, and she feels responsible for getting them all stuck there. That’s a lot of grief to carry.",startrek,Cxndymoon,False,/r/startrek/comments/hwn258/more_love_for_janeway/

*If Spock could contact New Vulcan, why couldn't they contact earth which they seem to have a line of sight.

*Captain Krik seems to kick the core in the wrong direction and yet the core snaps back to place. 

*Why couldn't they save Krik from the core, it seems like he's locked in passage chamber and he did close something which was behind him. 

* He seems to invulnerable to stun guns from spock's girlfriend's gun yet scotty stunned him.

68,Patrick Stewart. Captain Picard. Patrick Stewart. Captain Picard. Patrick Stewart. Captain Picard.,1595514514,"I decided years ago that during the late eighties, Captain Picard and Optimus Prime were the greatest role models in pop culture for a young boy.  Optimus Prime I was never really even exposed to, I just know enough about the character to know how selfless he is.  But Picard, I grew up watching TNG.  

I was in Rhode Island, where there were so many broadcast networks overlapping that if the weather was good, I could watch three hours of Star Trek on a Wednesday, choosing between five episodes.  The rest of the week was four.  I had very little to feel good about as a kid, and escaped into the world of TNG every single day.  

I loved Picard.  He did everything right! He was kind but stern, he used his intellect as a weapon, never raised a fist.  He was clever, and strong.  He knew how to say no without being hurtful, because he lived outside of his own ego.  He's kind of what I wanted in a dad, not a mean alcoholic.  So for years, I just laid on the couch, in a single parent home, watching Captain Picard do his thing.  In a way, a weird, embarrassing way, being raised by the values of a make believe starship captain.

I wish I could say that the values stuck, but I have bipolar I and borderline personality disorder.  I wish I could say I think as clearly as Picard would have.  I don't.  I can be mean and selfish.  But I always go back to WWCPD.  

I didn't realize until I was almost thirty that Stewart has spent his entire life fighting for battered women, because of what his dad did to his mom.  I didn't find out for a few years after that that he has spent a large part of his life fighting for messed up veterans, because of what the world did to his dad.  

I think the only member of the Trek family who can compare is Nimoy, because he was truly a remarkable man.  I don't know what I'll do when Patrick Stewart passes.  I don't give a shit about celebrities really.  I don't care about Kanye, or the lady who wrote Harry Potter.  I care about Patrick Stewart.  He means so much to me.

Patrick Stewart is a good man.  HE IS Captain Picard.  And this video presents everything I love about the man.  His class, his care, his dry humor.  It's perfect.

Do you think Voyager might have had more luck or been a more interesting show if they’d really leaned into the “our ship was **NOT** designed to last so far away from regular maintenance or starfleet resources.”

My idea was that post Ep1 Caretaker Voyager would’ve been more heavily damaged. It still has its warp capabilities and shields/weapons but sub systems like replicators, internal force fields, holodecks are either destroyed outright or so badly compromised they can’t function effectively.

This would give us a more battered, living on the edge version of Voyager (not dissimilar to Year of Hell) where resources are truly scarce, bulkheads and components can’t just be reproduced or repaired. We maybe see different parts of the ship repurposed into hydroponics, extra crew quarters and traditional manufacturing. It’d be a much more dirty and industrial version of the ship where life in the Delta Quadrant is less “*perfect, functional, clean ship but isolated from home”* and more “*ragtag ship cobbles together repairs and dangerous tech to get by while crew lives on top of each other with minimal resources”.*

I think this kind of scenario could help build more believable bonds between Maquis and Starfleet survivors as they struggle alone in the dark and make the whole dilemma of “do we find somewhere hospitable to settle or continue home in hopes of someday getting there” a more hard hitting decision.

It was explained by Geordi that the Enterprise got caught in the loop after the initial collision with the Bozeman, which triggered the temporal loop.

So what got the Bozeman initially trapped in the loop for 80 something years before the Enterprise came along?

Also, I’ve always thought it’s sad that they missed a perfect opportunity to throw in a quick TOS reference.

When Picard says he’s commanding the starship  Enterprise, it would have been nice if Captain Frasier Crane had been like “Isn’t that Jim Kirk’s ship?”

I recall the ship moving very slowly through this cloudy green (maybe orange?) nebula.

Maybe it's a phantom memory...

However, because of this memory, my sister and Ma and I instead started saying ""I love you to the cabbage patch and back,"" because this Star Trek episode showed the edges of the universe as looking like a load of cabbages or lettuces. We now sign off every text message with a lettuce emoji because it means (to us) that ""I love you to the universe and back."" 

Anyway. I now live in the U.S. and they're in Britain and I have no idea when I'll next see them because of Covid.

No Prime Directive and Captain Archer is a Mad Dips-hit.   
1 - Archer is a Mad Dips-hit it makes perfect sense, because he is the first, there is no training, no basis of reference and no command who has the safe option on hand. He is just the lucky guy who got the job.   
2. No Prime Directive. That's pretty cool, Captain Archer... and the crew for no that matter have no idea what to do when placed in a complex situation. Like Season 3 when they returned an asylum seeker who gets Epsteined.   
3. BEST PART!!!! NO FUKING TECHNO SCIFI BABBLE!!!!  I get so sick of star trek techno babble. Its like there is a formula for every other star trek. The Quantum-Defribulator I mean... Siliconide-Datatronic-Pumperator Or. Electro-organoid-computational-abacus, OMG Miceluium-Network.., Like what the hell are these words. It's formulaic and overused. 

4. Good use of time travel - They did a good job ripping other scifi. Like death stars, so many death stars!!!! 70 fukin death stars!!! Oh! and Dune they got the fish people from dune. OMG the Fish people from dune travel through rifts in their Giant mothership that fits enterprise. Total ripoff!!! Over and over, you can tell that the writers knew their scifi.

27,Highlights on Sharing TNG with Mom - #1 Encounter with Health-Care,1595442244,"Hey all. I'm in my late 40's. I first watched Star Trek with my mom, local 3pm reruns here on KWGN Denver's 2, back in the day. She loved sharing with me those old reruns, as she used to watch Star Trek in the dorms when they aired in the 60's. Later, I discovered the Saturday morning animated show, which was a cartoon, and thus mine alone. Then, in the late 80's they put out Star Trek The Next Generation. I was rounding out high school and the show became my main Star Trek, an instant love. [Captain Picard was my TV dad.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtfxYRkMmnc) I had a dad, of course, a good one. Just, you know, not as good as Jean-Luc Picard, as a role model for certain things that were increasingly important to me in my idealistic and impressionable youth.

This show was also mine alone. For whatever reason, busy with life and moving in separate circles at the time, my mom didn't tune in with me. So I went along on the journey of all the Star Trek that followed, while my mom left off probably around Star Trek IV: The Voyager Home, before.

Anyway, in mid 2018 my mom, now widowed, a city council alderman and in her 70's, was diagnosed with cancer. She underwent a successful operation for removal, but at the end of that year the operation had an unexpected life-threatening complication that nearly killed her. I found her on the floor in her bathroom (during an arbitrary visit I almost didn't make) and called for an ambulance, and escorted her to the emergency room where she no doubt would have died had I not been there to relay the information of her earlier procedures. 

On a side note, Star Trek has ruined modern medicine for me. The compassionate, confident Trek doctors with access to databases with all current medical information--including those of their patients--are a far cry from the overworked emergency room doc who had no database to consult to find out why this woman was screaming and dying in front of him. There is no such database in our world unless you pay a subscription service that provides it; it's like we live on Ferenginar.

Aaaaanyway, thus began a long, slow recovery where I largely became live-in with my mother while we worked towards recovery. So, It took the opportunity to see if my captive audience wanted to go through Star Trek: The Next Generation. Rather delirious, she agreed. 

Thus began our adventure through something we probably should have shared a long time ago. By the end of the journey her delirium and passed and the weight of the endeavor (and, possibly, my anxiousness to conclude it) became clear. She's part of the old TV generation: shows on at certain times; appointment television; weekly chapters. Soap operas get the dailies (the few good ones that are left). She's not really a binge-watcher and thus despite my best efforts (I assure you) it took us just over a year-and-a-half to get through TNG and all the movies (we rewatched old movies 2-4 and 6).

My mom wanted to watch the whole series, and we did. For much of season 1 she was on some heavy medication. She enjoyed it, of course the gems The Naked Now and 11001001, and Encounter at Farpoint and even the lesser Hide and Q. She remembers John De Lancie from his old soap opera days.

In fact, a great many of the guest stars we would see in subsequent season of TNG were moonlighting soap stars whose faces my mom would recognize. It became clear as the series went on that casting for romantic guest stars would often plumb that pool.

Datalore seemed to pass right through her. She loved Data and Brent Spiner for the whole series but she never seemed to take to the Lore storyline, whereas I was so compelled by it. We both felt like the guest admiral for Too Short a Season turned in a riveting performance, I found myself getting much more into that episode than I had before. Aging, as a topic, means a lot more now, really.

She took to Worf. Klingons were not just bad guys, to her, over the years. The word had become an affectionate G-rated derision, like ""dirtbag,"" you could say to someone: ""You Klingon!"" I don't know that I've seen anyone else ever do that: it might be unique to my mom! In any case, Heart of Glory really seemed to compel her with this story of this orphan Klingon who wasn't sure what he was, or what he should be. She would follow his story with interest throughout the series.

I'm not sure she knew what to think of Picard yet. You might recall he was a bit unclear, early on. I think it was the death of Tasha in Skin of Evil, Picard's revenge on Armas, and the subsequent eulogy, that helped her see his merits. Main characters didn't die on Star Trek. She left the episode not believing it. Denise Crosby ironically deserves a great deal of credit for creating a watershed moment for TNG and Picard in season 1 by quitting the show. 

She loved Wesley, and Beverly, from the start. Mom was a red-head in her youth (so was I!), and I was precocious and smart as a kid. Here we are watching together, small wonder! Wesley had a lot of moments in Season 1, good stuff as well as bad. As these faded, she missed them, and she was pretty upset when Dr. Crusher left for season two, not liking Dr. Polaski at all. Fortunately for her I had the foreknowledge to let her know our beloved Dr. Crusher would return shortly.

The Romulans returned and the Borg made their first blips on the radar in The Neutral Zone, but as we rounded out season one she felt sorry for the housewife whose husband froze her without even asking. Hey that was really messed up!

Season 1 she watched largely from the couch, healing and snoozing. I would try to rouse her not to miss stuff, turn it off and try again later if needed. I suppose, for me, I wanted to have something with an in-reach goal, that we could share together, to compel her to stick around and keep enjoying the world with me. In the time since, she has healed, but the world has gotten sick.

Star Trek, and particularly TNG, has always been a bit of a fable that has brought me hope. A fable about a bright future for humanity. And it may just be a fable, really, in the end... and maybe even one that has more holes in it and seems a lot further from our potential future as time moves on.  But nonetheless it's one that's brought me hope and encouragement throughout my life, and lent me an idealistic framework wherein I can view our present folly as future growth. And I think I've been able to share that a bit, with people I've loved in my life, my wife, my son, and now, reciprocally with the person who started me on the journey of appreciation in the first place.

36,Some meta commentary on the DS9 episodes “Far Beyond the Stars” and “Rejoined”,1595430852,"So in Far Beyond the Stars, which takes place in the 1950’s, where it would not have been socially acceptable at the time to publish a story where a black man was captain of a space station, at one point one of the characters suggests that they may be able to get around that by having Benny Russell’s story end up being “just a dream” of a black child, as that would make it more palpable for a 1950’s audience.

I recently made the connection that the creators of DS9 sort of did this same kind of thing with the season 4 episode “Rejoined” which famously, and somewhat controversially for the time, featured a lesbian kiss on screen between Dax and another female character.

Keep in mind, although most people wouldn’t think much of that in 2020, back in 1995, this would have really been a big deal, where there was still very much this “don’t ask, don’t tell”, “won’t somebody think of the children?!” attitude towards homosexuality.

So to get around this, the creators basically played it off that these two female characters are Trill symbionts who happened to be in a heterosexual relationship in a past life, so they aren’t *really* homosexual.

Any thoughts?

Edit: also just to clarify, in no way am I defending these past intolerant social mores.

Especially where the Trek franchise is generally supposed to be more progressive and “woke”, how was this blatant whitewashing still greenlit?

This basically changes the movie to a great episode of TOS.

You also get pulled in more to the confusion when Kirk is contacted by Carol about Genesis. But the best part of the movie is the attack from the Reliant. Like Kirk, you have no idea why it is behaving strangely, and then you get floored with the Khan reveal. Really good stuff.

When I first read that I was annoyed, like it was an objectification.  But then I started to think, of course they did.  She's gorgeous.  Stunningly gorgeous.  And it's in a way that is in no way related to the viewer, as an object of desire, but entirely  herself, and how Farrell as a performer carries herself.  She presents a beauty to be admired, not desired.

And the character herself, able to show the depths of conscious expression, everything from manic enjoyment of the present moment to the deepest, knowledgeable compassion. Dax is deep as hell. She's a queer icon, a feminist icon, probably an icon of other things I'm missing.

Farrell did a great job with the character.  Truly one of the best things about Star Trek, and certainly DS9.

51,What would a realistic version of Wesley Crusher look like?,1595416925,"So there's this kid. He's super-smart, and super eager to learn, especially about science and engineering. He's not old enough to have a driver's license, but he's given the job of piloting the Enterprise without any training. What would a more sensible role have been for him?

&amp;#x200B;

First, he should be stationed in Engineering, not the Bridge. This would mean he gets less screen time. This would also mean his primary role model would be Geordi, rather than Picard. Or maybe Data, but that would require some very good writing to not come off as cheesy.

Since we wouldn't see very much of him in most episodes, perhaps he'd be featured in a few episodes, where he's properly involved in solving a problem, sort of like how we never see Barclay, and then suddenly he's the focus of an episode.

He should not be given the role of Children's Ambassador. For example, in ""Justice"", he's asked to join the away team to decide if the planet would be an appropriate place for kids to play on shore leave. That episode is terrible for a number of reasons, not least of which is that I don't think Wesley would be the type who relates well with other children. He's really smart, grew up as an only child to a single mother. I think a lot of children growing up in this position would not be good at interacting with other children. On top of that, he's interacting with adults, and trying to prove himself in an adult role. It would be insulting for his commanding officer to constantly treat him as a kid. And since most of the senior staff does not have much experience with kids of their own, I think they would more likely make the mistake of giving him responsibilities that he isn't emotionally developed enough to handle. 

I do think he has an unfair chance to get close to the senior staff, but this is unavoidable for a character with regular screentime. And even though it might be unfair, it is believable. He's the son of the chief medical officer. His mom and the captain were close.

Hollywood CGI was ready to put this universe on display and was especially impressed with how BA the ships were.  Really loved the cast too.

I didn't watch much Star Trek before watching the films, but recently been watching a lot of sci-fi including ""Enterprise"", and now in retrospect, I see how bad these films were on a whole other level.  

When searching for news about the film, it appears if there is another film it will be in the same universe and tap the same cast.  

But can this storyline be saved?  

I am not sure, I think to put out a really great film worthy of the franchise would be a massive shift from what they have built, and while they have a cast of good actors, they really trashed most of the main characters and built a storyline which is mostly throwaway.  

The only saving grace may be gap in time between releases which having older versions of these actors could be used to portray these characters differently and tell a more compelling story.  

IMO this franchise thrives in telling longer stories, and deserves treatment on par with ""Lord of the Rings"", building out a much more expansive universe and building up to really epic battles would really be something else.

It manage to be simultaneously the sweetest and saddest. Watching Data bond with his daughter as they figure out the parent-child bonding relationship was incredibly sweet. Then there's the hilarious scene where Riker is kissed by Lal and Riker noping out of the bar fast upon Data seeing it. Wait does that technically make Riker a pedo? 

The part where Lal is interviewed by the asshole Starfleet Admiral and then rush to Troi from feeling fear. Wow, you just don't expect to see her experiencing emotions like that. It only makes her death scene only more sad when she tells Data she loves him, while Data struggles to feel it. I do love how the Admiral redeems himself at the end given how torn apart he looked with Lal's death. 

Yet as with most Star Trek episodes, it still ends up a bright note though with Data saying how Lal will be with him always akin to how our memories of our loved ones will always keep them with us. I can only imagine how this episode would feel if you watch it as a father with a daughter.

29,"For a lot of people, it's not their cup of tea, but there's so many subtle details that I love about Voyager, and I still discover new ones now",1595292350,"I was just rewatching the series again on Netflix, and came to the season 3 Episode ""Before And After"". It's about Kes living her life backwards from the time of her death because of a complication between an experimental life extension technology and latent chroniton poisoning she suffered during an attack from the Krenim.

What really made me marvel at this episode is that when it aired, the *actual* ""Year of Hell"" two-parter that shows the interaction with the Krenim hadn't aired yet. So what the writers did, essentially, is they showed the audience a ""what if"" episode for an episode that hadn't aired yet. It wouldn't be until the middle of season 4 that this episode with Kes would truly make sense.

When the ""Year of Hell"" finally did air, we finally understand that it wasn't even truly a ""what if"" episode about what would happen if Voyager hadn't ""reset"" the timeline with the Krenim... it was a ""what if"" episode about what would happen if Kes had remained on the ship and Seven hadn't.

In ""Year of Hell"", the critical moment that allowed Voyager to take the fight to the time ship and defeat it was *Seven* cataloging the exact flux of the Krenim's torpedoes so that Voyager could create shielding that protected it from both the torpedoes and the time weapon. We see in this episode that without the presence of Seven, not only do they not get to reset the timeline, but both Janeway and B'Elanna die.

This would be interesting on its own, but the conflict with the Krenim is the *central* idea behind this Kes episode.

The first half is like a normal Trek episode and really has good pacing. The tributes to the old crew and Nimoy in particular were heart warming without being over the top. To an extent I also found this movie appealing due to the fact that the literal earth shattering implications of the last two films weren't present here, it was more localized to a Star Fleet outpost/base. They managed to use modern music in a really nifty and cool way in this film rather than the other times where it was just forced/conveniently there. The ending of the film and the coming together of the crew/rebuilding of the enterprise and accepting of this unknown person(Jaylah) into Starfleet and the overall vision that Roddenberry would have envisioned for the future was nicely done too.

66,I'm ashamed it took so long...,1595257045,"For years I've considered myself a ""Star Wars guy"". I'm 35 and have had a deep love for the origional trilogy for a really long time. And I used to be a pretty die hard fan... until the prequels when I was in high school. It slowly started to fade for me and has been downhill ever since. For YEARS my stepdad would tell me that I'd probably really like Star Trek, and for years I was resistant because of some preconcieved notion about how dorky and campy it seemed. Growing up in the 90s I would periodically catch a TNG episode sort of in passing, so I have always been familiar with the characters to some degree, but not so much the story. I actually really liked the movie reboots that came out about 10 years ago, but those didn't lead to any desire to actually watch any of the seasons.

&amp;nbsp;

Recently I got a wild hair (thanks to covid, boredom, and a weird desire for 90s nostalgia). Netfilx must have read my mind because they put TNG as the front page recommended show. So, it seemed it was finally time to dive in and actually give it a real unbiased chance. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Now I'm rethinking all kinds of life decisions.** It is easily one of the best shows I've ever seen. I've never been so oddly satisfied by a show in my life. It ticks so many boxes for me it is insane!

&amp;nbsp; 

First and foremost, the writing is absolutely top notch. It is intelligent, deep, complex, and rooted in real science (obviously there is some fluff, but not totally outlandish fluff). And the dialogue is rich and interesting, which makes character developement much smoother.

&amp;nbsp;

Second, the character developement is fantastic and well paced. I've gotten to know everyone and I feel a connection with each character and I actaully give a damn about what happens to them (F for Lt. Yar). 

&amp;nbsp;

Third, The acting is superb. Seriously, I'm blown away by how well each cast member is able to really bring that character to life and make you believe them. I honestly thought this would probably be the worst part of the show, but I couldn't have been more wrong. That said, it is worth mentioning that the fight scenes are bad (but hilarious) and, to me, not in a bad way. I know that sounds ass backwards, but I'm glad they aren't going too hard in the paint on fight scenes. The way they are done seems to fit the style of the show and doesn't detract from the story. It is usually quick and to the point, thus helping the story along. 

&amp;nbsp;

Fourth, and probably my favorite aspect of the show, the themes. Most of the episodes are truly complex and actually make you think about philosophical topics (ie Data and his rights as an Android or the episode where nanobots escape Crusher's experiment and become a collective conscience). These are deep and difficult topics that you don't get with most shows and it really makes you think long and hard about how we would actually solve those problems. **The show was so ahead of its time.**

&amp;nbsp;

Last but not least, the show itself has an uplifting vibe. I don't know how to describe it, but it is one of those shows that isn't an emotional drain. My wife watches a bunch of murder, and I'm typically a comedy kind of guy (The Office, Parks and Rec, Rick and Morty, etc.). I tend to steer clear of emotionally taxing stuff. This has a little bit of everything (death, mystery, drama, comedy, etc) and when it is over I still feel really good about it.

&amp;nbsp;

Now I'm finding myself proselytizing to my friends and family about this show and hoping they'll give it a chance. So, I guess I'm a Trekkie now.

&amp;nbsp;

**TL;DR I was a hard line Star Wars fan in my youth and hated Star Trek without ever giving it a chance. Now I hate myself for waiting so long to actually give it a real chance. The show is absolutely amazing.**

68,Some thoughts on Enterprise,1595254733,"I've been going through a first-time Star Trek marathon of all the series and films (yes this included the Animated Series damn it!) since September of last year (ah...pre-covid19 days) and it's been great. So many great episodes and those wonderful feelings of seeing them for the first time. It's been a long time, but I'm almost done and am on the third season of Enterprise

I was curious on the thoughts people have on this show because I honestly didn't think it was that bad in the first two seasons. Granted the temporal cold war stuff was kind of strange, but the overall light-hearted, exploratory feel reminded me a lot of TOS and TNG. I also really liked the episodes demonstrating the tension between humanity, the Vulcans, and the Andorians, which I'm sure will set up nicely when &gt;!the show reveals how the Federation was formed!&lt;. All this feel good stuff and then...the third season. I know this show came out right around when 9/11 and the Iraq War were going on, but my goodness this is starting to get unbearable with the goofy commandos (I hate this Major dude) and all these plots centered on &gt;!punishing the Xindi for destroying Florida!&lt;.

Also, what's the deal with the show just totally ignoring Travis? It was hilarious at first but now it's weirdly concerning as a viewer.

I've done a side-by-side and I am almost 100% certain this voice is Jamie Lee Curtis. In the same timeframe as TMP, she also did uncredited voice actor work as the narrator and the computer in Escape From New York (1981).

Side note: Escape from NY actually had two voice actors. The main narrator and computer voice, and the computer voice for the tracer that Snake Plissken wears to verify his location. That voice is also uncredited, but may be Debra Hill.  The Jamie Lee Curtis voice is credited as Kathleen Blanchard both in Escape from New York and Escape from LA, probably a pseudonym.

Anyone know for sure? This is driving me crazy and I can't find a reference anywhere.  It would be super cool to nail this down.

77,Dr. Pulaski is better than Beverly Crusher,1595221412,"I know many trek-fans disliked Dr. Katherine Pulaski that appeared in season 2 of TNG.

I can imagine some of the dislike by some trekkies is because she is not as ""pretty"" as Dr. Crusher.

However, re-watching TNG again, I find Dr. Pulaski a much better character. First she is not just another ""yes woman"" like Beverly is, she continually challenges Picard and the other staff. She might not always be right, but at least she is strong-willed. Beverly, most of the time, is ""just there"", her only duty as a background healer, and nothing more. 

Some people disliked her because she was ""mean to Data"", but overall I feel that in just one season she showed growth and towards the end of it she seems to show real friendship for him. Fans tend however to forget that Data was an oddity and Pulaski attitude was he norm, not the exception in Starfleet: remember they had to hold a trial to show Data was not merely ""Starfleet property""! 

Her banter with Data is strongly reminiscent of the Spock-McCoy conflict, and as a character Pulaski seems to grow in that respect, starting out as viewing Data as a mere machine but then realizing he's more than that

I think overall Pulaski raises good questions on what and who Data is. All the other members just assume he's ""one of the guys""... but really is he? Are his responses real consciousness or just simulated. These could have been great questions to be explored and I think Pulaski personality and attitude could have made for some awesome Pulaski-Data episodes. 

&amp;#x200B;

More importantly, Pulaski reminds me a lot of Dr. Coy. She is highly focused on ethics and her duty as a doctor above anything else. She addresses the ethical elephants in the room with no hair on her tongue, speaking  her mind. 

What made the TOS great was the conflict between Spock and Bones, with Kirk in the middle. In TNG everybody is mostly a yes-man.

78,Where is the USS Barclay?,1595220689,"After TNG and Voyager it's only logical that Starfleet build the USS Barclay based on engineering designs for a crossover drive called ""Slip Stream.""  Or in other words the Andromeda Slip stream crossover adapted to Star Trek.  

Reginald Barclay passed away and left a life time of Halo research on the subject when he was influenced by aliens in the slip drive technology.  Thus leading to the refit of an old hull with new engine technology allowing for a slip stream that allows the ship to reach other galaxies in very short time.  The slip stream drive isn't practical for short warp drive jumps, but does allow one to go from one quadrant of the galaxy to any other quadrant or other galaxy in relatively a short amount of time.  

The first trip of the USS Barclay is the Andromeda Galaxy to meet the aliens encountered in TOS episode, ""By any other name.""  

The USS Barclay would be one of the best ships for a star trek series as it could really travel the Universe and is a great reflection of the star trek series as a whole and does tie in nicely with the star trek spin off Andromeda.

82,Some episodes of Strange New Worlds should take place before The Cage,1595217114,"Upon looking at Star Trek history I see that the years 2251-2253 are relatively empty and unexplored. Besides Kirk joining Starfleet, we don't know what any of the other characters are up to. In particular Spock. I'm doing some research on Vulcans, and despite having a very detailed timeline, Spock has nothing going on in those years.

Short Treks Q&amp;A takes place in 2254, and that depicts Spock's first day on the Enterprise, but we don't know anything about his time in Starfleet Academy, mostly because Spock is a very reserved person and never talks about his personal life. Even Discovery barely shows anything about him being in Starfleet Academy.  That's why we know more about Kirk during this time, but it would be cool to see a young Kirk cameo on Strange New Worlds.

It would be cool to see Pike and other characters with a blank slate and see how they are before the events of The Cage which happens in 2254. Most people seem to predict that the Strange New Worlds should take place between the other unexplored years of Star Trek history which is 2258-2262. Yet I do not think that Strange New Worlds should be a three season show that just ends at 2253. I think that it should jump around in the timeline between the two empty segments of Star Trek history. That being 2251-2253 and 2258-2262.

Note: It can also be argued that the Kelvin-timeline does a really good job filling in a lot of events that happen in the time period between 2258-2262, but because of the events in those movies the timeline is sped up and everyone advances in their careers much quicker. The Strange New Worlds TV series essentially does not happen in the Kelvin-timeline because Kirk is Captain 2259ish and Pike dies. Spock and Pike never really serve together.

16,My opinion on the JJ Abrams/Kelvin timeline,1595184045,"Having recently gotten on Reddit I was excited with the possibility of discussing Star Trek movies with other users. While I have watched both TOS and TNG and The Wrath of Khan, I must admit I am not the worlds biggest trekkie. I simply love movies. But I see a severe lack of appreciation for these films.

I am young. I was nine years old when the 2009 Star Trek film came out. This was a time after the disappointing Star Wars prequels where my hopes for a space adventure had only diminished. My father, who is a Trek fan was excited to watch the film and I remember being blown away by the thrill of it, the fantastic action sequences, fun lore, amazing music and even the cool filmmaking - the lens flares, handheld shots of the Enterprise in space... it was cinematic heaven from the moment the USS Kelvin was evacuated with Chris Hemsworth remaining on the ship. By the end of the film, I was completely smitten by the Enterprise crew and these new takes on the characters. For me, Chris Pine’s Kirk was THE captain kirk. Michael Giaccibo’s score was THE Star Trek theme. The alternate timeline was a very clever way of passing the torch and rebooting the franchise.

Years later came a trailer for Star Trek Into Darkness. The 2009 cast was back, this time with Benedict Cumberbatch in a trailer reminiscent of The Dark Knight. I showed all my friends. I remember people theorizing that BC was playing Khan. I also remember going to see The Hobbit a second time just to see the first 10 minutes shown before that movie played... and it did not disappoint.

Then, the movie came out. Could it possibly live up to that 2009 film  which I had watched over and over again? It turns out JJ mde the sequels that had all the things I loved about the original film, exploring Kirk and Spock’s relationship further and upping the stakes. Oh yeah, and John Harrison actually was Khan. I didn’t care, I loved it. Cumberbatch’s performance was magnetic and powerful. Threatening while also having our empathy. I loved the story, the third act which remixed WOK and distinctively remember my friends tearing up at Kirk’s death. The blood storyline was a little goofy, yes. But it didnt take me out of the movie as much as it might have some other people. The Dark Knight Rises and had a nuclear bomb exploding on the ocean and people kinda forgive it because Nolan is such a fantastic director and I feel the same way about JJ’s movies on this franchise. Plus it’s a very small part of the film. At the end, they head into their 5 year mission.

Overall I think Into Darkness is more entertaining and just as great in quality as the 2009 film.

Then comes Star Trek Beyond. JJ left the directors chair to make The Force Awakens and handed things over to Justin Lin. The film was madr to bean extended episode of Trek written by Simon Pegg. It has a lot of interesting themes. Even an entertaining story. However, I feel that a lot of the energy from the last movies is missing. The film still has action sequences, but this time they feel a lot less exciting, with JJ’s directing style not being translated over to Justin Lin. The film still has the stellar cast and an interesting story about Kirk coming to terms with being his own man. I would say the film works as a Star Trek film better than the last two but apart from the same cast it doesn’t feel like a sequel to Into Darkness or the 2009 film and more like its own standalone story. Even the musical score plays the same notes, but it comes off somehow less energetic and exciting. And that is fine. There are a lot of things to like about Star Trek Beyond. It’s cool to finally see these characters in a proper Star Trek adventure even if it is in my least favorite film, it’s still a good one.

I wrote this to say that I get that lots of people think Into Darkness is garbage. I get that these films might not resemble in their essence the Star Trek you fell in love with. JJ himsef said that his vision was to make Star Trek as a Star Wars film. But there are those of us out there who fell in love with these movies because of these choices. The original Star Wars was a defining moment for many filmmakers out there today and the 2009 Star Trek film was that experience for me. We may never get a 4th movie with this cast for a number of reasons but I will always cherish them as some of my favorite blockbusters.",startrek,theragingcactusman,False,/r/startrek/comments/hu5kin/my_opinion_on_the_jj_abramskelvin_timeline/

My only guess is that real alcohol is still used regularly &amp; considered acceptable outside of starfleet/active duty (civilian use on Earth for example) and the habit of consuming synthehol acts in a similar manner to vape juice that has no nicotine and instead behaves almost as a habitual substitute where the user simply wants to emulate drug use without any deleterious effects, so maybe the starfleet crews grew up drinking real alcohol and they substitute for synthehol when on duty to give them a type of familiar experience to share and bond over, but even then, *why would people choose to drink fake liquor for the 'taste and aroma' if they're not trying to cut down on the real liquor or deal with alcoholism*?

The story wasn't ENTIRELY unique. But the execution and story of it was inspired. To me anyway. I don't want to give away TOO much in case someone hasn't seen it yet. But there may be minor spoilers ahead, so be warned.

It was just the way that Voyager had such a profound and enduring effect on a single planets evolution. It effected their entire civilization, religion, mythology, culture, etc. Spanning centuries.

Voyager essentially got stuck in a cosmic sinkhole for an afternoon and completely sculpted a planets society over hundreds and hundreds of years. Granted they were causing them major problems, but it wasn't on purpose. 🤷🏼‍♂️

Shazad Latif has a weak jaw and instead of rocking his \[awesome FULL beard\]( [https://scifanatic-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/sdcc18-dscred-shazad-head.jpg](https://scifanatic-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/sdcc18-dscred-shazad-head.jpg)) this whole time, they instead go with neck-beard to further exacerbate the situation!

So, in conclusion, we have cry-baby, sorry, pouty, weak jaw, neck beard Ash Tyler, the sleeper spy Klingon experiment in a terribly unromantic ""Romance"" with the lead character.  I know I'm probably the only one who feels this way but, dammit, Michael Burnham deserves a way more bad-ass love affair than this!

94,Thoughts on Disco,1595084923,"I don't have a lot of good stuff to say about this, but I'll start with the positive.

Hot Spock is hot. That's definitely the hottest iteration of Spock.

The first season and the first half of the second season, in a vacuum, weren't that bad. It was actually pretty decent. The one thing that taints the show is the fact it's a prequel to TOS. There's so much future tech and so much cannon breaking it feels awkward and disjointed. Every time they brought up or mentioned they were in that timeline and they obviously had future technology and the like it disrupted my suspension of disbelief. And it does it in an insulting way. Sometimes writers, write themselves into a corner and have to pull something stupid to get themselves out, OK. Other times, like in Disco, they start with a stupid premise and think the audience is too stupid to care.

All they had to do was set Discovery in the 25th or 26th century, change the names, and tell us the Klingons are a new race, then all would be forgiven. It would really take nothing meaningful away from the show. It would only add a layer of disbelief. 

At the end of season 2 the writers do apologize. ""No more holograms, ever."" And they give a lame excuse why no one has ever heard of Disco or the spore drive. ""We will never speak of it again."" One last thing I liked, like I said before, Hot Spock is hot, he has a very squeezable butt, no homo. So that was the positive stuff.

The rest is just garbo. The writing was really-really bad in a lot of areas. Absolutely paper thin. For instance, the episode before the season finale was 100% filler. It didn't move the plot forward at all. The entire episode was, ""I'm going to go forward in time, I'll miss you my family."" There were a lot of stinkers in DS9, but there was nothing that thin.

Michael became an emotional mess in the second half of season 2. It felt really stilted considering she spent a large chunk of her childhood growing up as a Vulcan. While not genetically Vulcan, she still had the mental training to stifle her emotions... and throughout the series that's why they made her out to be. Throughout the first season they made her out to be a fairly emotionless Vulcan type. By the end she's a frantic mess. I don't see that happening. I wasn't sold on that. In short, captain Janeway she was not.

What's up with Ash? I don't really get his deal. Maybe I wasn't paying attention. Let me get this straight. He has the body of a Klingon that was chopped down to human proportions. He has the brain of a Klingon and then they imprinted Ash Tyler's memory onto the Klingon brain. And now he contains both consciousnesses of Ash and Voq, but mostly Ash?

The shaky cam during the CGI action scenes was the bad kind where it would look awesome if you held the camera still, but since it's shaking you can't see shit. They forgot to tell the actors to shake around during ship to ship combat scenes, so the camera shakes violently, but the actors are stoic. 

The mirror universe and time travel narratives are my least favorite plots from Star Trek, so not super thrilled about that.

The mirror universe plot was bizarre. I'm not sure why Michael chose Georgiou over Lorca in the mirror universe. Lorca freed Michael from prison and gave her, her redemption in Starfleet. While Georgiou looked like someone from Michael's past, she's quite clearly evil as fuck. That's why Lorca and Michael from the mirror universe tried to overthrow her, because she was into genocide and went too far. But, uh oh, in a moment of terrible writing the writers virtue signaled that Lorca is the bad guy when he said something like, 'Make the mirror universe great again."" OH! He quoted Trump. Very subtle and nuanced Star Trek Discovery, now I know he must be the evil guy!

Oh, and how about this, they put evil Georgiou in a position of power in Starfleet. The bitch destroyed planets in her universe. Performed mass genocide on different races. Enslaved millions, if not, billions of people. And then she becomes a ""good guy."" I just have one thing to say, Fuck You Discovery.

There's a lot of lazy and bad writing, but I'll stop there. Lastly I just want to bring attention to the fact that none of the women on Star Trek are hot. You've got tons of hot dudes, and thank god for that, but the women are all 5 out of 10s at best. Then you have Tilly who's not super hot, but she is thicc as fuck, and they never show off he butt at all. Maybe it's misshapen, but with complementary clothes you would never tell the difference. With all the money they spent on special effects, they couldn't just make the women look good too? They have to look fugly?",startrek,HoodUnnies,False,/r/startrek/comments/hti3rq/thoughts_on_disco/

Which got me thinking about Trek's portrayal in comedy shows over the past many years. Futurama's ""Where No Fan Has Gone Before"" and Family Guy's ""Not All Dogs Go To Heaven"" are the biggest examples, but just look at how fans have gravitated to The Orville, citing it as being closer to Trek than the official shows as of late.

36,Defending Picard's Setting/Tone on the Federation,1594998580,"In the months after *Picard*'s conclusion, I still find myself thinking about this story a lot. I am much more favorable on this series than others, in part because of some of the bold choices it took. I'm a lifelong *Star Trek* fan, with *TNG* in particular being the show I grew up with and still hold dear. 

I've had some good conversations in other threads with fellow fans about *Picard*, so I've been putting words to some of my longstanding thoughts about some aspects of this show that I found great that others found disagreeable. So here, I take a shot at defending the state of the Federation &amp; Starfleet as seen in *Picard*. I have some other areas where I want to write on (the aesthetic, who Picard is, etc), but want to see how this goes first. I'm not here to defend *Picard* as perfect, because it has its glaring flaws. But I think some of the more objectionable decisions the writers made actually work in terms of the continuation of this franchise based on prior established events.

I admit, this is long, so not sure how much engagement I'll get, but hope that whatever engagement occurs that it's respectful and fruitful. So here we go...

**State of the Federation &amp; Starfleet**

Much has been made about how the Federation, previously depicted as a future utopian ideal, was made darker. I’ve seen claims that it could be considered dystopian. While I think this latter claim is far fetched, it is fair to say that the world is darker. From my perspective, this is not a complaint; Rather, it makes sense as the continuation of events established in the later *TNG* films and the aftermath of the Dominion War in *DS9*. 

In *Insurrection*, Ru’afo attempts to bend the Federation into the forced removal of the Ba’ku with the claim that “the Federation is *old*”. At that point in time, the Federation’s influence had seen a major shift against its influence. The grasp for power in the galaxy had already begun. We saw it unfold onscreen. The Borg invasion in *First Contact* had left a significant depletion in Starfleet’s armada. Overlapping this was the ramping up of the Dominion War, which after those few years had left hundreds of millions dead. 

(Note: I attempted to find an estimated number of Federation casualties on   Memory Alpha. I was unsuccessful. If anyone knows, please pass on the information. My estimation of “hundreds of millions” is based off of ongoing comments in the series of mass casualty lists, entire worlds like Betazed that that Federation lost to the Dominion, and an equivalent number of Cardassian military and civilian casualties)

After the *DS9* and the final scenes of *Voyager*’s “Endgame”, *Nemesis* is the last 24th Century event seen on film until the destruction of Romulus in 2009’s *Star Trek.* While *Nemesis* does little to advance a narrative connected to the Dominion War or other military conflicts in recent past, the Federation’s urgent motivation to open diplomatic relations with the Romulan Star Empire can be taken as evidence that they want to establish powerful new allies *and* ensure that another longstanding potential threat does not actualize into more armed conflict. The end of *Nemesis* leaves the relationship murky. Both sides fell prey to the betrayal of Shinzon, and that commonality seems to invite the possibility of an alliance (evidenced by Captain Riker’s mission to the Neutral Zone at the end of *Nemesis*). 

After *Nemesis*, the **only** established canon in the 24th Century is the destruction of Romulus in the first J.J. Abrams film. That major event only served as a backdrop in that film, something (stupidly) cataclysmic to further a villain’s motivations. In no way could the writers of *Picard* ignore such an event, and in my mind, they rightly established this as a a tone-setter for the Alpha and Beta Quadrants seen in *Picard*. 

Picard takes place in 2399. Here are the major events in the short 25 years prior to that date:

&amp;#x200B;

* Borg Invasion (2373)
* Dominion War (formally 2373-2375, though battles began before the declaration) 
* Shinzon (2379)
* Synth attack on Utopia Planetia (2385)
* Destruction of Romulus (2387)

With these events involving the loss of life, ships, and entire planetary civilizations, it makes sense that the utopia we previously saw depicted in the franchise devolved. Note, however, that very little of what we saw on Earth was actually bleak. If anything, things were seemingly bright. In the media tour prior to the premiere of *Picard*, Patrick Stewart went on record saying he wanted a show which spoke to the times. In an interview with *Variety*, he went further that the world of *TNG* “doesn’t exist” anymore. This caused a bit of an uproar in parts of the *Trek* community at the time. But the thing is, he’s right. Just like the world of *TNG* was different than that of *TOS*, the world of *Picard* is different than *TNG*. 

There’s been so much chatter about what makes *Trek* “*Trek*”, and claims that certain series “aren’t *Star Trek*” because they don’t fit the box of each of our subjective preferences of the franchise. So I’ll offer mine: what makes *Trek* “*Trek*” to me is its ability to speak to the issues of our day. *Star Trek* holds a mirror up to us and asks us to look deeply, and at its best offers lessons for how to navigate the complexities of the world we live in. 

*TNG* is timeless. Many of those stories still work today, but Stewart is right in that the socio-political world is drastically different. In our last 25 years (hell, less than that), we’ve seen tribalism rise up in ugly ways, and the resurgence of explicit prejudice and racism in positions of power. So what made *Picard* feel so “*Trek*” to me was its adaptation to the world we live in now versus the one we lived in the last time the 24th Century was available to us. 

It made absolute sense to me that the Federation would turn their backs on the Romulans. They were a longstanding enemy about to be dealt a cataclysmic blow to their Empire. With that event and that event alone, the Federation’s authority was seemingly boosted. It made sense to me that Starfleet would isolate one of its most decorated officers because of his principles, because at that time, the principles of the Federation and Starfleet had shifted. In the short 25 years of losses, the Federation was staring at a win. It did the bare minimum to help, but left the Romulan refugees largely to fend on their own. From here, things turned lawless in certain sectors. And another thing that made sense to me: a vigilante force (Fenris Rangers) to try and establish some sort of order, however grey the order was. I see elements of all of this happening, to varying degrees, in our world today. I’m thankful *Trek* has them as part of this world, for right now, to help us think about them.

Now, I’m not offering a defense that this all was done perfectly. In my mind, *Picard* would have been stronger had it brought all of this to the forefront of the story instead of the background for establishing the story of the first season. While I think the similarities are there for Picard’s motivation to protect the synth population, the connective threads were rather weak. Part of my hope for season two is that Picard and his crew can be sanctioned as Federation ambassadors to restore relations with the Romulan settlements and truly provide us some ideas of diplomacy in a world of broken relationships.",startrek,Socraticmichael10,False,/r/startrek/comments/hsxc82/defending_picards_settingtone_on_the_federation/

So the episode opens with Kirk uncharacteristically giving up a mission for a fool's errand, the first time I think he's done this. Perhaps he'd had a look at the script and decided to get out while the getting was good.

Seriously though, I didn't think this episode was that bad. It has a goofy opening for sure, but gets somewhat profound later on. Granted, it does have a weak ending, but taken a whole I found it diverting.

I had absolutely no idea this episode was about Abraham Lincoln so when he suddenly appears in space I was completely disoriented. What the hell? Suddenly this is an Adult Swim show. I can't help but imagine this episode being made today with Trump manifesting before the Enterprise and I get the giggles.

Scotty isn't impressed with this premise either given the remarks he makes in the transporter room. Actually this episode would have been quite amusing if a group of alien intelligences arrived masquerading as great Earth leaders in order to influence the crew, with Robert The Bruce to appeal to Scotty, Jimmu for Sulu, and Shaka Zulu for Uhura. Probably Napoleon for Kirk.

Usually the crew recklessly beam themselves down into unknown and potentially deadly conditions. This time they're beaming some sort of monster masquerading as Abraham Lincoln aboard. Good to see they're learning.

The music that plays when Lincoln arrives is awful and I begin to fear we're headed for The Omega Glory Part II. It's beyond hilarious that Kirk says ""The US Enterprise is honored to have you aboard Mr President"" even as the framing shows a guard with a gun trained on Lincoln. And kind of tasteless given the manner of Lincoln's death. This episode is weird as hell so far. And why on Earth would Kirk know off the top of his head how high army observation balloons were typically tethered in Lincoln's day?

In the briefing room, Spock correcting Scotty about the direction Earth is in is one of the funniest moments in the show this far. It's also interesting to see McCoy and Scotty stand up to Kirk and it's a cool/eerie touch that the phasers don't go with Spock and Kirk when they teleport.

The ""charming negress"" exchange is interesting, and hard to parse in 2020. I'm no authority on the nuances or history of the words negro/negress, but I can tell you from my Marvel comics collection that both Marvel writers and their readers (through letters) used these words in 1968 very matter-of-factly. In fact my Sergeant Fury And His Howling Commandoes comics which I'm reading at the moment as part of my quest to read every Marvel comic ever printed use them quite a lot - the title was known for acknowledging the role of African Americans in WWII through the character of Gabriel Jones, with multiple stories and moments acknowledging his blackness and what it meant. (I recently read issue #56 from July '68 and was quite stunned with the bold, confrontational way it deals with black attitudes to white prejudice, it would still be striking to find this material in a newly printed comic.) I infer that these words weren't considered offensive at the time, at least not amongst the white mainstream, and Star Trek is anticipating a future in which these terms become unacceptable. Hence Lincoln apologizes, but then Uhura says that humans are no longer offended by language. Which sounds like a nice progressive concept but makes no sense at all, because it implies she wouldn't be offended if Kirk responded with ""That's right, you bitch."" Still, an intriguing little moment which seems more interesting than the episode itself.

And isn't that just the theme of the day. A lot of the incidental stuff presented here is more interesting than the main meat of the episode. The crimes of Green and Zora, the world-building of Surak's character, the implied and sadly never developed epic backstory of Kahless, as well as the biology and nature of the Excalbians themselves all intrigue me more than the rather sad action sequences that are supposed to be my payoff for watching. See the greatest minds of military might and evil as they... sharpen some pointy sticks. Genghis Kahn is particularly pathetic, doing nothing but lamely throwing rocks to no effect whatsoever. In fact you could delete him and Zora from the episode for all the role they have. It's a shame because the fights in The Cloudminders just one episode ago popped with action and thrills, whereas the ones in The Savage Curtain are among the weakest the show has seen. As for the villains, Kahless' vocal performance lets the side down, having nothing like the presence I would expect of a legendary Klingon leader.

At least Lee Bergere does well portraying an uncanny valley take on Lincoln. He doesn't seem quite right/human, but that's fine because he isn't. His voice isn't what I'd have for Lincoln but he still does a good job, and delivers an excellent speech to Kirk before the final battle about the nasty nature of war. Atwater leaves little impression as Surak, but that perhaps isn't his fault as it is so much that the character is intended to be extremely moderate and emotionless. It is interesting that Surak is a pacifist while Vulcans are not, and that Spock is emotional in comparison, suggesting that Vulcans are influenced by Surak's philosophical extremes, but do not ape them entirely, compromising between them and pragmatism. One also notes that this is not Surak but an idealization of him drawn from Spock's mind, so it is ambiguous whether this portrayal reflects Surak's nature or Spock's fears about not living up to Surak. The same could be said of Kirk and Lincoln.

However, the Excalbians. As a design they're fantastic. After ten million alien races that are people with silly beards or hats or in some cases just plain indistinguishable from humans, the Excalbians are one of the more original and best realised alien looks we've seen. The texture of the costume, the movement, the steam coming off it's skin, the immense, terrifying tail. Great. The problem is of course their nonsensical scheme. It's as though the writer was embarrassed about the episode just being a blatant Arena rehash and tried to hide it with a whole lot of high falutin' philosophical talk - they don't quite get away with it. If the others besides Spock and Kirk are just projections from Spock and Kirk's minds rather than the actual historical figures, this is not a battle of good and evil but rather just a simulation of Spock and Kirk's impression of these figures. And what exactly is Surak's death supposed to teach us? Pursuing peace is for suckers? The climactic fight fails as spectacle as noted earlier and it is won through Kirk's skill in combat - what point does this make about good and evil? The Excalbian even says something like ""You didn't do anything illustrative of good and evil, what was the point?"" And then they say ""Well that must be about fifty minutes kthxbye."" For me the highlight of the episode is the earlier scene in which Spock and Kirk clash over the way they react to Surak's suffering, with Spock feeling Surak must be left to his fate and Kirk unable to do so.

For me, this wasn't so much bad as it was disappointing. Like a few this season, there's a much better episode hiding inside it. I can't bring myself to hate it because there were a number of cool and interesting ideas and elements, but I also don't find it very memorable because it squanders these promising ideas on a fairly bland story that is concluded fairly carelessly.

56,Who’s on your Trek Rushmore?,1594958656,"You get 4. The 4 persons who are most significant or worthy of celebration in the history of Star Trek. 

Mine:

Michael Piller. Gene L. Coon. Harve Bennet. Dorothy Fontana.

Piller was definitional, I feel. We talk about Roddenberry’s vision, because Roddenberry talked a lot about his vision, but Michael Piller really refined what made Trek so great. His writing and his leadership, shepherding 3 young writers rooms into a pretty impressive set of producers who are still active today is an incredibly legacy.

Gene L. Coon raised the kid. He established the Cold War allegories, the self assessment and criticism of society, and made sure the show kept running. When they lost him for the third season, the quality dropped and there was no bringing it back for nearly a decade. Piller may have refined it, but Coon defined it: the Klingons, the federation, the prime directive, this is the DNA that made Trek trek.

Harve Bennet sparked life into a revival that would come to redefine what popular science fiction would be. If the TOS films had not been so successful, there may not have been an appetite for TNG from the studios. While his films may not have been as cerebral as the television shows had been, they showed a willingness to transgress genre and show a spectrum of what Trek could be, and by Spock’s Ears are they ever fun! While TMP might be accused of taking itself too seriously, Bennett’s films were always self aware enough to wink at you and acknowledge the fun. He made Trek accessible to a new generation through the silver screen.

Dorothy D.C. Fontana, she carried the torch. Her writing helped define Spock, arguably the most iconic character of the entire franchise. A woman in a writers room that may not have been easy to navigate, she became a rock that kept the ship on course. Story editor on TOS, show runner for TAS, and probably the reason TNG Season 1 was better than it had any right to be. She has the achievement of working on 4 iterations of the show, her last being DS9 and the definitional episode “Dax”.

Honourable mentions: 

the Great Bird, Gene Roddenberry, who’s reputation hasn’t helped him in my eyes, as he almost seemed to work against his own vision, writers succeeding in spite of him. But he is the progenitor and we wouldn’t have trek without him. 

Leonard Nimoy, whose performance catapulted Spock to the iconic role it is now, and directed two of the feature films.

Ira Behr, who created a show that provoked a deep conversation in Trek, and both expanded its range and redefined things we took for granted about the world of the federation.

Ron D. Moore who grasped so much of what made fantastic science fiction and drama, and brought this outsiders point of view to the room, ready to challenge the norm.

Rick Berman, who I again struggle with the reputation of, his seeming failure to truly grasp what was best about Trek, but he oversaw its most productive years and gave us a decade and a half of what is the core of Trek. He cannot be ignored.

Alex Kurtzman, who is quickly becoming the new Rick Berman, though with a better personal reputation, struggling with artistic criticism while expanding the horizons of what Trek is and could be. I doubt he’ll ever reach the estimation of others on this list, but the output of this era will remain a quintessential part of Trek’s history.

- Harlan Ellison, author of award winning “Star Trek” episode, “The City On The Edge Of Forever” 

The concept of “canon” (and it’s slope-headed progeny, “Trek”) was lifted from “the Great Game,” to determine which Sherlock Holmes stories were written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and thus “canon” to the game. As the outdated and absolute atrocity of a Wikipedia entry shows, this term has since been transmogrified to mean “whatever elements of a fictional universe are germane to its story as determined by some official body of fans.”
This is wrong on its face and by several orders of magnitude:

“Canon” and its slope-headed progeny, “Trek,” is nothing more than fanboy groupthink to uphold their deluded belief they know more about “Star Trek” than its current creators.
 	
There was a point where I stopped watching “Star Trek” entirely. After sitting through TOS and the first six movies, it struck me as being on the enjoyable but shallow end of the s-f pool. By the time the sixth movie came out, it proved it could tread water on the deep end. So when TNG, DS9 and VOY debuted, I had my expectations and they were not met. ENT? That’s for the Twilight crowd and their moms, hence vocals in the theme and Scott Bakula (milf bait) is the captain.
  
That bad was 100% on me. “Star Trek” is a television show and television isn’t something to expect a whole lot from. To get to “A City On The Edge Of Forever,” we have to “Take The Way To Eden,” them’s the rules. When I watched an episode of DS9 and realized it was a lot better than what I remembered, watched the entire series and had an epiphany. Following a hunch, I re-watched VOY, TNG and ENT. 

Hunches confirmed, when I saw the trailer for DSC, I thought, “If I watch that with zero expectations, like I did the others, I’ll enjoy that,” and that’s exactly what happened. Much like a lot of people, I’ve been a fan of “Star Trek” for decades. I too know a fuckton of stuff about “Star Trek.”

I also know CBS is a *business*. It exists to make *money*.
  
If you boil the spazzflail about determining what is “Trek” or “canon” to some semblance of coherence, it’s essentially everything, however flawed, from TOS to ENT is “Trek” (because “canon”), DSC and PIC isn’t (because “canon”). This is a patent nonstarter. 

CBS is the sole and absolute determiner of what is “canon.” They paid George Roddenberry good American money for the rights to “Star Trek.” They own it, lock, stock and phaser. If the canon/Trek cult really could do it, they’d be actual Star Trek creators versus podcasters and en masse occupiers of comment sections. It’s obvious, yet moot.

There’s no such thing as “canon.” Consider Wikipedia’s definition that is specific to this instance: “In fiction, canon is the material accepted as officially part of the story in the fictional universe of that story. It is often contrasted with, or used as the basis for, works of fan fiction.” (However an atrocity of writing and logic, it’s a useful atrocity.)
	
As such, it’s impossible to tell a creator, especially a multibillion dollar corporation that holds the legal rights to a fictitious universe what is or isn’t officially part of the story. That’s the harsh reality why all the complaints about DSC, PIC and inevitably SNW, will continue to deservedly fall on deaf ears. Moreover, if you parse the “canon” argument carefully, there’s no coherent basis for it whatsoever.

Part and parcel of the DSC and PIC isn’t “canon” argument is neither upholds Gene Roddenberry’s vison of “Star Trek” and science fiction. There are two enormous problems with this argument. 
	
One, a lot of what “TOS” is actually known for was created by other people, specifically [Gene L. Coon](https://www.wired.com/2016/09/gene-l-coon-star-trek-hero/). If it wasn’t for him, there’d be no Starfleet, United Federation of Planets or Klingons among others. TOS story editor DC Fontana was tasked with developing Spock and Vulcans. This isn’t to knock Roddenberry but to provide perspective. Because when you look under the hood on “Star Trek,” it gets real ugly, real fast.

Coon and Roddenberry clashed over Coon’s use of humor in “The Trouble With Tribbles” and “I Mudd” leading Coon to resign. Meditate on that, Gene Roddenberry getting mad at somebody for taking *humor* too far in “The Trouble WIth Tribbles” and “I Mudd.”
	
Second, the “Star Trek” fandom had in fact been entreated to Gene Roddenberry’s most perfect vision of it and science fiction. He was the big kahuna and one of the screenwriters of the [*first motion picture*](https://screenrant.com/star-trek-gene-roddenberry-lost-control-reasons/). 

Because it tanked, he was *replaced* when the sequels were announced and he disliked all of them immensely, going so far as to ironically declare TFF - the one William Shatner directed - “not canon.”
	
Do you consider all of the first six movies “canon?” Meditate on that. 
	
Let’s reference the TOS writer’s guide because Gene did write that. One of the complaints about DSC and PIC is that Starfleet isn’t the heroic, inspirational organization as it was in “canon.” 
	
DSC takes place before TOS, and all Roddenberry directly wrote about Starfleet at that time was:
	
“Naturally, there is a headquarters somewhere, general orders and a whole command hierarchy. Again, we try to stay away from it as much as possible. The galaxy is incredibly vast, the problems out there are complex, and a Starship must necessarily operate as a semi-autonomous unit.” (emphasis added)

That’s it. We don’t need to review any of what landed Michael in the brig. The question of whether Starfleet was a military or scientific organization as posed in a line of dialogue was never specifically answered by Roddenberry until he wrote the writer’s guide for TNG:
	
“... [Starfleet] is under the aegis of United Federation of Planets. Starfleet is not a military organization. It is a scientific research and diplomatic body.”
In PIC, Jean-Luc has a massive issue with Starfleet allowing the Romulans to get blown up, however, *as written*, Starfleet can’t act independently of the United Federation of Planets. The UFP might feel a certain way about Starfleet helping out a standing enemy.  

Any “canon” based argument against DSC or PIC is inconsistent on its face because any canon argument is inconsistent on its face. There is literally no argument that can be levelled at DSC or PIC that can’t be levelled at any other iteration of the series. 

Why can’t you use a fungus to power a starship? Never mind they usually run on hot rocks, in a pinch, alien corpses work perfectly. Let’s really go there: which Seven of Nine is “fan serve,” spandex and corset lesbian or post-spandex and corset lesbian?  Pike’s still a white guy and captain of the Enterprise, what’ll the problem be, exactly?
 
	
And to really put “canon” on the business end of a bat’leth, not only is Wikipedia’s definition horrifically written, its example of “Star Trek” canon is *outdated.* 
	
At the time of this post, it is based on a 7 year old FAQ answer that’s no longer available on the - omg! - CBS website. There, the search term “canon” leads you to this page. The definition is also wrong by virtue of its maladroit wording. Dr. Who is a fictional universe without a canon.

It sure is a good thing the entire concept of “canon” was thoroughly invalidated before this point, otherwise we’re left with the disquieting possibility that Disney pays Seth McFarlane for “Star Trek” fanfic.

“Star Trek” is over 50 years old. It has to adapt in order to survive, per the Vulcan maxim, “Infinite diversity in infinite combinations.” If you didn’t realize the show had to change in part as a matter of necessity, clearly you weren’t paying attention. If the current show doesn’t meet your expectations - that’s your fault, not the show’s fault. 

Expect nothing and you won’t be disappointed, that’s the epiphany I had upon rewatching all the other iterations of “Star Trek.” To prove this point, I have a long-standing issue with JJ Abrams. I knew well in advance to not hand over my money when the reboot movies came out, let his fanboys learn the hard way. That said, I’ll sit through any Kelvin timeline movie if I’m watching tv out of boredom. I know they’re mostly dumbed-down versions of “Star Trek” but they’re not entirely unwatchable either. The cast does a great job with the material.
	
That’s how actual “Star Trek” fans get down, we’re the ones who called the first movie “The Motionless Picture” but we can still find good things to say abut it.

He showed the fandom exactly what he thought “Star Trek” should be and it blew back on him until it got a second life on video. On 2nd glance, it’s really not that bad of a movie it’s just slow and stiff and the cast does a great job with the material.
	
It’s not that difficult to find something to like about any version of “Star Trek,” even movies directed by someone you don’t like. Other people are brought into the fold. The circle expands. It is the way of things.
	
As for the gatekeeping fanboys and poseur ilk, their insistence on “canon” and “Trek” and “canonicity” and that nonsense, they’re not going anywhere. This is largely because their hallowed ground has been cratered out from under them.

63,"Reminder: 'Star Trek"" fans use both words when discussing the franchise because ""Trek"" is for gatekeeping fanboys.",1594949570,"“By wildly extravagant heroification of Gene Roddenberry, all the untruths, all the false credits, all the betrayal and perfidious behavior he wallowed in, has been permitted to be flensed. ... leaving only this glowing icon who wouldn’t lie or hurt a fly. Yeah, and there are schmucks who think Adolf Hitler made the trains run on time.”

- Harlan Ellison, author of award winning “Star Trek” episode, “The City On The Edge Of Forever” 

	The concept of “canon” (and it’s slope-headed progeny, “Trek”) was lifted from “the Great Game,” to determine which Sherlock Holmes stories were written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and thus “canon” to the game. As the outdated and absolute atrocity of a Wikipedia entry shows, this term has since been transmogrified to mean “whatever elements of a fictional universe are germane to its story as determined by some official body of fans.”
	This is wrong on its face and several orders of magnitude: 
	“Canon” and its slope-headed progeny, “Trek,” is nothing more than fanboy groupthink to uphold their deluded belief they know more about “Star Trek” than its current creators. 
	There was a point where I stopped watching “Star Trek” entirely. After sitting through TOS and the first six movies, it struck me as being on the enjoyable but shallow end of the s-f pool. By the time the sixth movie came out, it proved it could tread water on the deep end. So when TNG, DS9 and VOY debuted, I had my expectations and they were not met. ENT? That’s for the Twilight crowd and their moms, hence vocals in the theme and Scott Bakula (milf bait) is the captain.  
	That bad was 100% on me. “Star Trek” is a television show and television isn’t something to expect a whole lot from. To get to “A City On The Edge Of Forever,” we have to “Take The Way To Eden,” them’s the rules. When I watched an episode of DS9 and realized it was a lot better than what I remembered, watched the entire series and had an epiphany. Following a hunch, I re-watched VOY, TNG and ENT. 
	Hunches confirmed, when I saw the trailer for DSC, I thought, “If I watch that with zero expectations, like I did the others, I’ll enjoy that,” and that’s exactly what happened. Much like a lot of people, I’ve been a fan of “Star Trek” for decades. I too know a fuckton of stuff about “Star Trek.”
	I also know CBS is a business. It exists to make money.  
	If you boil the spazzflail about determining what is “Trek” or “canon” to some semblance of coherence, it’s essentially everything, however flawed, from TOS to ENT is “Trek” (because “canon”), DSC and PIC isn’t (because “canon”). This is a patent nonstarter. 
	CBS is the sole and absolute determiner of what is “canon.” They paid George Roddenberry good American money for the rights to “Star Trek.” They own it, lock, stock and phaser. If the canon/Trek cult really could do it, they’d be actual Star Trek creators versus podcasters and en masse occupiers of comment sections. It’s obvious, yet moot.
	There’s no such thing as “canon.” Consider Wikipedia’s definition that is specific to this instance: “In fiction, canon is the material accepted as officially part of the story in the fictional universe of that story. It is often contrasted with, or used as the basis for, works of fan fiction.” (However an atrocity of writing and logic, it’s a useful atrocity.)
	As such, it’s impossible to tell a creator, especially a multibillion dollar corporation that holds the legal rights to a fictitious universe what is or isn’t officially part of the story. That’s the harsh reality why all the complaints about DSC, PIC and inevitably SNW, will continue to deservedly fall on deaf ears. Moreover, if you parse the “canon” argument carefully, there’s no coherent basis for it whatsoever.
	Part and parcel of the DSC and PIC isn’t “canon” argument is neither upholds Gene Roddenberry’s vison of “Star Trek” and science fiction. There are two enormous problems with this argument. 
	One a lot of what “TOS” is actually known for was created by other people, specifically [Gene L. Coon](https://www.wired.com/2016/09/gene-l-coon-star-trek-hero/). If it wasn’t for him, there’d be no Starfleet, United Federation of Planets or Klingons among others. TOS story editor DC Fontana was tasked with developing Spock and Vulcans. This isn’t to knock Roddenberry but to provide perspective. Because when you look under the hood on “Star Trek,” it gets real ugly, real fast.
	Coon and Roddenberry clashed over Coon’s use of humor in “The Trouble With Tribbles” and “I Mudd” leading Coon to resign. Meditate on that, Gene Roddenberry getting mad at somebody for taking *humor* too far in “The Trouble WIth Tribbles” and “I Mudd.”
	Second, [the “Star Trek” fandom had in fact been entreated to Gene Roddenberry’s most perfect vision of it and science fiction](https://screenrant.com/star-trek-gene-roddenberry-lost-control-reasons/). He was the big kahuna and one of the screenwriters of the *first motion picture*. 
	Because it tanked, he was *replaced* when the sequels were announced and he disliked all of them immensely, going so far as to ironically declare TFF - the one William Shatner directed - “not canon.”
	Do you consider all of the first six movies “canon?” Meditate on that. 
	Let’s reference the TOS writer’s guide because Gene did write that. One of the complaints about DSC and PIC is that Starfleet isn’t the heroic, inspirational organization as it was in “canon.” 
	DSC takes place before TOS, and all Roddenberry directly wrote about Starfleet at that time was:
	“Naturally, there is a headquarters somewhere, general orders and a whole command hierarchy. Again, we try to stay away from it as much as possible. The galaxy is incredibly vast, the problems out there are complex, and a Starship must necessarily operate as a semi-autonomous unit.” (emphasis added)
	That’s it. We don’t need to review any of what landed Michael in the brig. The question of whether Starfleet was a military or scientific organization as posed in a line of dialogue was never specifically answered by Roddenberry until he wrote the writer’s guide for TNG:
	“... [Starfleet] is under the aegis of United Federation of Planets. Starfleet is not a military organization. It is a scientific research and diplomatic body.”

64,"Observation about about thé Bajorans and Deep Space 9: “We won!...Now what?""",1594947300,"I’ve been watching a lot of early season Deep Space 9 lately (thanks COVID and unemployment) and just wanted to share an interesting thought I had about something I noticed as a recurring theme, in the early seasons at least. 

A lot of the plots and subplots surrounding Bajor could all be summarized by the phrase ""we won!...now what?"" Our female lead, Major Kira, is not a professional soldier l’or explorer like her Federation superior and colleagues; she is a former resistance fighter who spent much of youth (like millions of others) fighting an occupying force. 

After its victory, it doesn’t appear that Bajor (or the Cardassians or the Federation for that matter) really thought about what would happen **after** the occupation ended. Once the honeymoon of victory wears off, Bajor devolves into a simmering level of infighting that becomes hot at times. In the early seasons, the Bajoran government is portrayed as almost hopelessly divided and almost always on the verge of collapse. The one remaining institution left is the Bajoran religious faith; however, it is not as united as it appears. The economy almost always seems weak and reliant on the Federation and others. The Bajoran military, while staffed by experienced and resourceful officers like Kira, are seemingly almost always outgunned by almost every other species they come into contact with.

The whole portrayal reminded me of times in history when revolutionaries fought off their occupiers, only to be left wondering what came next, followed by periods of chaos and instability. A couple of examples:

1) The early United States under the Articles of Confederation

2) The Irish Free State after the war of independence with the British, and later, the Irish Civil War

3) Post-WW2 France under the provisional government and Fourth Republic

It kind of skirts the line of whether or not Data has emotional responses, but maybe that's why the writers chose to have Data be the center of this episode. A logical argument could be made for every action he took, so that deepened the debate about how the Prime Directive did or did not apply in this situation. Speaking of debates, the one in the Captain's Quarters among the senior staff is one of the best Prime Directive debates of the series. There are much better episodes, obviously, and, again, Data's actions are a little iffy for this point in his character arc, but I still love it as a ""Prime Directive"" episode.

Sin #1: Riker ID's that Lore is either intentionally or unintentionally dishonest by testing his knowledge. He fails to register this with either the Captain or with Tasha. 

Sin #2: Data fails to report to the crew that Lore has been dishonest. He's not supposed to play favorites or give people the benefit of the doubt. He's a walking computer. He follows procedures to the letter, and correcting people when they're wrong is something that is established in his character.

Sin #3: Picard asks Data where his loyalties are. Not so much a sin in itself, but after asking that question, he does completely ignore ""Data"" acting out of character later. 

Sin# 4: Tasha Yar questions the possibility of Data being disloyal, but fails to suggest anything as simple as having a chaperone present. 

Sin #5: Riker routinely orders Westley to spend time with Data/Lore but everyone ignores his mistrust, even though he's spent the most time around Lore. 

Sin #6: Westley suggests that Lore has replaced Data and nobody even considers this. At the very least, they could have asked Data a question only Data could answer. 

Sin #7: Picard berating Westley (""SHUT UP, WESTLEY!"") reflects on his professionalism and I'm surprised no-one, especially Riker, allowed it to pass without reporting it to the bureaucracy. Even current militaries have rules against unprofessional abuses of junior officers, and this is supposed to be Starfleet, the best of the best, and Starfleet officers don't lie, as per Westley one episode prior. 

Sin #8: Nobody (read: Tasha) suggested that lowering the shields for a really lame demonstration of power would also leave the ship vulnerable to attack. 

And so much more. 

At the very least, Tasha Yar should have gotten her record fucked up by allowing the entire incident to take place. It's her job to prevent the possibility of loss of control of the ship.

However, the universe doesn't necessarily reward that.  The treaty itself is completely one-sided, in favor of a people *known* for treachery and deception.  Our guaranteed lack of a cloak - never mind one as monumentally useful as the interphase cloak - cripples our military, our intelligence operations, etc., and makes us vulnerable in ways other powers will never be.

Which leads me to what I'm sure a lot of real-life nations do today: publicly display one thing, and, in secret... do what needs to be done.  Pressman, Ross, Section 31, etc.  That's a bigger discussion, but I wanted to focus on Pressman and the cloak specifically.  I feel like if I were in Picard's place, once I saw that thing in operation (as he does near the end of the episode), I would understand why Pressman was doing what he was doing, and, well, probably be complicit.

People also don't do the 3 square meals anymore, they eat only when they are hungry so they produce less waste. 

Where does it go? The shower shares a suite with the replicator. It breaks down the waste to it's molecules and stores it in a recycle box for the replicator to reuse or sends it to waste reclamation to be readded to the main replicator stores.

6,"FYI in the german dub of DS9, Morn speaks 4 words.",1594880588,"in the the last episode of season 2, ""The Jem’Hadar"", right before the intro, Quark talks to Morn before they get interrupted by Odo. Before Odo appears, Quark urges Morn to tell him whats wrong with him since hes looking the be somewhat depressed. Morn is about to talk and raises his hand to start talking when Odo interrupts them. In the english original he, as expected doesnt say anything, in the german dub you can hear him saying ""ach, äh.."" which is not much and would just translate to ""oh, um..""
then the Odo leaves and quark with him, allthewhile Morn is anticipating that the conversation with Quark will continue once Odo leaves. But when Quark also leaves immediately with Odo, Morn sighs in the english original, but in the german dub you can hear him clearly say ""dann nicht.."" which would translate to ""allright, then dont..""

Obviously the translators took a lot of freedom here and clearly didnt get the memo about morn and what hes all about... which isnt suprising since the german dub is terrible on lots of occasions (the literal translation i mean, the VAs performance is very good, although there are problems as well). but thats a topic for another time..

Meanwhile the Closed Caption team wasnt so terrible after all, since these 4 words are the only words in the entirity of DS9 that have no CC. I imagine them beeing ""you did WHAT? Were not going to caption this, you heretics!""

So I've watched all of TNG, just finished DS9, and I'm working my way through Voyager (no spoilers please!).

I have to say, DS9 is definitely my favorite so far. I think the setting being grounded in strong long-term plotlines that have to do with politics, and better character arcs, is what made me like it more than TNG (or Voyager thus far). TNG was very dedicated to ""what if"" sci-fi (which is great), but sometimes all of the people on board were a little too shiny and happy, never having real personal problems or issues. I'm curious if anyone else feels the same way.

I'm also VERY curious about if other people agree or noticed some other things:

1. Is it just me, or did Julian Bashir change quite a bit over the 7 seasons? He started out young and earnest, chasing Jadzia and trying to get answers out of Garak. I noticed in the later seasons that somewhere along the way it seemed like all of this energy just left him. I don't know if the actor got tired of his role, or if there was some intention behind it. Certainly some of the things he experienced could have had that effect (being a Jem-Hadar prisoner, being outed as genetically enhanced, etc), but if it was intentional I would have liked to have seen an episode talking about it. I know all of the characters changed in some ways, but it seemed really apparent in Bashir. By the end of the series I didn't really like him as much.

2. The ending to Sisko's emissary plotline felt incredibly rushed and unimportant. Having Gul Dukat be there at the end just for shock value felt really forced, and having Sisko's ultimate destiny just be ""I showed up and the right time to tackle someone"" felt like a real let-down, especially since there was no reason he couldn't have brought someone along to help him. I like to think that his real destiny was being the right person to help Bajor and the Federation through a very delicate period in their relationship. But the Pah-Wraith ending felt anti-climatic to me. Maybe it was just too rushed.

3. Does anyone else feel like Voyager has a weak start? I'm part way into season 3 right now, I had to push myself to keep going in the first season. Janeway has made some pretty stupid decisions in my opinion (including contradicting herself at times, thank you poor writing), and it took me a while to start liking her.

While I recognize there are a lot of Trek fans who would disagree with me or have different opinions, IMHO the episode takes almost a false equalization of Nog/Red Squad versus Jake Sisko. 

Those cadets never had any business operating outside Federation Space once the commissioned officers got killed. I partly blame the Captain's 'dying words' to Cadet Watters putting him in command and continuing the mission instead of heading straight back to Earth. Nog was put in a tough position, but he should have attempted to take command from Watters in his ready room upon arrival. I also take issue with Watters' assertion of how he got the field commission--automatically on the defensive when saying the Captain was still 'lucid'. There should have been a contingency order in writing (and I'm sure there probably was) instructing the cadets to return in an emergency. I also find it somewhat dubious that all the commissioned officers got killed.

At the very least, the Valiant should have returned to Earth as soon as they got solid intel on the Dominion battleship--instead of attempting its destruction and risking losing all the intel they had gathered. 

And, the mission briefing in the mess hall, with Cadet Watters' rebuttal to Jake being ""We're Red Squad, and we can do anything!"" was a ludicrously poor argument.

I'm firmly on Jake's side on this one. He's proven to be a very smart and thoughtful young man and the only reasonable person on the Valiant. He recognizes how ridiculous the situation is on the Valiant. And, the senior officers' confrontation with him for just talking to the Petty Officer about home is, in and of itself, reason they should turn back. The fact that members of the crew cannot have simple conversations about home without risking an emotional breakdown is evidence enough that they were in over their heads. 

Other observations: The concept of Red Squad reminds me of the worst of modern university systems with campus 'royalty' and preferential treatment. One, Red Squad should have been discontinued after carrying out the global infrastructure attack in Homefront/Paradise Lost. Two, Red Squad is an element of Academy favoritism that shouldn't exist. It's likely not completely merit-based, but with admission likely based on having the right contacts in Starfleet. And, once you're in the Academy, *all* cadets should be given the best training opportunities.

The Naked Now is like PG-13 erotic fanfiction, which is NOT what I was expecting to see on this watch through. I was almost embarrassed to be watching it in the same room as my wife. I hope that if there are sexual themes in future episodes they are not nearly as clunky, awkward or cringe-worthy as these.

(Fanfiction has never been my thing, let alone erotic fanfiction, but I recognize Star Trek has a rich history of erotic fanfiction that I don't mean to disparage... if you're into it, you do you. But I imagine erotic fanfiction has better things to offer than The Naked Now).

I kind of *like* the idea that Data is sexual, because I think everyone deserves to have their own sexual expression, but at the same time I absolutely never want to see him get sexual again.

Also, they state over and again that the weird gravitational effect on water and carbon is causing people to act as if they were drunk, and yet not a single character actually seems drunk. They seem more delusional than delirious. I don't know, it just didn't make sense to me.

I had heard that the first season is rough to get through. I didn't know it would be this bad.

Curious to hear the random facts, and stuff that people have learned about it over the years

And yes I've gone through the Memory Alpha, curious what people might know beyond this from conventions, interviews, etc.

From what I recall:

- The series was planned to be one of the core shows for the planned UPN TV network (United Paramount Network) but when plans for the TV network fell through all the pre-production and filming for Phase 2 was reworked into The Motion Picture to salvage the investment

- Several VFX and model shots were planned and already filmed, so in order to salvage the investment they were used in the Motion Picture including the Klingon's at the beginning. The extended tour and pan of the Enterprise at the beginning doesn't make a lot of sense in context of a movie as it's a big block of time filler, but makes perfect sense in the context of a pilot episode.

- The new uniforms were notorious uncomfortable, and Shatner wore a girdle to hide his gut. Which is why they were never re-used.

- All the original cast were returning except Spock, Leonard Nimoy initially had no interest but was persuaded by fellow cast members to appear in TMP at the last minute forcing some rewrites.

- A new Vulcan named Xon was planned, and even cast to replace Spock but was abandoned when Nimoy decided to join the cast. The actor chosen for Xon plays the commander of the space station at the start of TMP. Some of his character concepts were recycled into Savik.

- The character concepts of Deckard and Ilia were recycled into Riker and Troi including their previous relationship.

- The TMP, and by extension the TNG theme, was originally meant for Phase 2

- Several of the un-filmed scripts and script concepts were recycled in TNG, notably as some early episodes due to a writers strike.",startrek,DarkAlman,False,/r/startrek/comments/hrgy2j/what_do_we_know_about_star_trek_phase_2/

73,"The Federation didn't abandon the Romulans, they came up with a much better plan for everybody.",1594785319,"I was thinking about Star Trek Picard at work today (becouse flipping burgers and washing dishes is quite automatic and mindless) and I realised Picard really shouldn't be as mad as he is. The Federation did not abandon the evacuation of Romulus after the Mars attack, they circumvented the need for a rescue at all. Let me explain.

The origonal plan, upon learning about the supernova, was for the Federation to build a fleet of 10,000 transport ships to evacuate Romulus and Remus (and presumably any other planets in that system). This was such a huge undertaking, particularly less then 25 years after the costly Dominion War, that in involved the heavy deployment and use of androids to accomplish. It is made clear in Picard that this is a massive undertaking even for the combined might of the entire Federation.

Then, from the point of view of the Federation, the synths attack Mars and destroy the rescue fleet and Utopia Planetia itself. If it was hard to create a rescue fleet before it's impossible now. There isn't enough manpower, shipyards, or time left to do so. But a few days latter Admiral Picard comes with a plan, a functional plan at that, to do carry out the relief mission anyways using existing ships and a bit of construction elsewhere in the Federation. Other people have done the math on how many ships are needed to evacuate Romulus, and it's not hard to see that this is going to take the majority, or even the entirety, of the fleet. A fleet still recovering form the hundreds or even thousands of losses suffered in the Dominion War. Such a mass migration of Starfleet into Romulan space would unquestionably leave Federation worlds vulnerable. Not just to attack from the remaining powers still hostile and unaffected by recent events, like the Breen, but to general piracy and natural disasters as well. (Think all the missions where the Enterprise has to deliver medical supplies or stop a comet from crashing or whatever.) This new plan buy the admiral is arguably an even bigger undertaking for the federation. And that's not to mention the dozzen or so member worlds who apparently havn't seen DS9 or Nemesis and are threatening to leave the Federation unless the rescue is dropped.

""But, Admiral"", they tell Picard, ""There is another solution. You see the Vulcans proposed an alternative solution based in a new scientific theory, Red Matter. We originally dismissed it as to risky and time consuming but recent developments made while we were building our fleet make it seem more and more likely that such a project can be completed safely and just in time to prevent the supper nova.""

The Red Matter plan the Vulcans eventually end up using is a FAR better solution then evacuating Romulus and Remus. If they let the sun go nova, the entire system is lost. However if they turn the sun into a black hole, the planets remain intact and there is no longer any rush to evacuate. Romulus is the homeworld of an interstellar empire, meaning it has plenty of electricity and infrustructure to keep it's population warm and lit (even in their own homes). This problem only gets easier as more and more Romulans leave the planet. On top of that Romulan culture is preserved in it's entirety. Every piece of art and anchient artifact can be removed at convenience and every monument preserved for people to visit as Romulus basically becomes a museum planet. EVA suits required of course.

Meanwhile the Remans actually win. Remus is tidally locked with it's sun, and as such Remans only live on the dark side of the planet, where there is absolutely no warmth or light from the sun (NOT on the terminator, Nemesis specifically states they live on the dark side). ""removing"" the sun effectively doubles the livable surface area of Remus. Furthermore Remans can still live and work on Romulus, as it's surface conditions now match that of Remus. Meaning they can either help with the evacuation or build all the infrastructure to grow food, retrieve water, and stay warm for an eventual re-colonization of the homeworld by Romulans. That or they can simply use it for themselves. That's up to the Empire (or Free State) to decide, not the Federation.

Now as for the Federation, all they need to do is create a single ship and a small quantity of Red Matter. That's a task the Vulcans are already committed to doing. So rather then having a task colossal for an interstellar Federation you now have a task small enough for a single planet to do without disrupting normal life on the planet at all. Those dozen racist worlds who need to catch up on their post-TNG Treks may be upset with the Vulcans, but have nothing against the Federation itself. It's as if an American state sent aid to the Soviets. The other 49 states wouldn't be happy but they wouldn't be mad at the federal government, who remained uninvolved.

Now you may say that plan failed, but remember it failed by a matter of minutes! If you watch the mind-meld scene from the 2009 movie, Spock tells Kirk that Romulus was destroyed ""on his journey there"". He then states he ""had very little time"". If Romulus was already destroyed then this makes no sense, as he was already too late. However it DOES make sense if Remus, the next planet in the system, hadn't yet been destroyed. Whatever the case, it can't take more then a day or two to reach Romulus from Vulcan with ""our fastest ship"" (presumably that's a bit faster then Voyager), so he was at worst a day or two late. Knowing the Vulcans, this likely means they predicted an accurate timeframe of being able to complete the project just in time to save Romulus, so the Federation didn't have to launch it's own military and police force as a rescue fleet.

As the galaxy watched in horror as both Romulus and Spock were lost, many Admirals probably regretted their decision to not have a backup plan. But even if there had been a rescue fleet of military vessels it's doubtful the inherently suspicious  Romulans would have requested the majority of it be send with Vulcan salvation still on  schedule for a last minute rescue.

So go ahead Picard, sulk. Get yourself fired and  blame the Federation for abandoning a request for humanitarian aid. The Romulan Free State will continue it's cooperative relationships with the Federation that \*almost\* saved their homeworld, did save Remus, and tried it's best after a major setback.",startrek,Official_N_Squared,False,/r/startrek/comments/hrglje/the_federation_didnt_abandon_the_romulans_they/

75,Which episode truly embodies each of the Individual Series for you?,1594783355,"Live Long and Prosper, r/startrek!

I've been a lifelong fan of the series, but am ashamed to admit that I have only been watching the shows themselves. My (M28) childhood fandom was fostered more through the novels, toys, and the various backissues of Star Trek: Communicator I found in my local used bookshop. However, thanks to Netflix (I'm in the Philippines), I've been binging all the shows nonstop. I currently am on Deep Space Nine, and hot damn this show is balls to the wall amazing. I never really held this one in very high regard early on, mainly due to the feedback I've read about it. Now, I'm seeing how unfounded those comments are.

Anyway, enough about me. My question for everyone here is this: for each series, please give me one episode you think perfectly embodies that specific series itself. For example, I chose **City on the Edge of Forever** as ""**the episode**"" for TOS because it has all the great characteristics (IMO) of a great TOS episode - namely, a controlled performance from Shatner, enough technobabble to give the episode a solid foundation to stand on, and a gut punch of an ending that stays with you after the episode is over.

Contestants: Borg, Species 8472, Aliens, and Predators (yes, THOSE Aliens and Predators (from their respective universe(s)))

Location: unfamiliar HUGE ship...perhaps the ""City Ship"" the voyager was pulled into by the Saurus species (originally from earth). The whole ship is accessible.

Setup: Contestants have never seen each other but have basic scan info on the enemy. The borg and the predators realize they have the upper hand as hunters and collaborate, as do the aliens and Species 8472.
No species is privy to hand over technology to the other even for a win but will strategize.

Gear: each Contestant type will have access to their entire weapons array and usual ""away team"" gear.

Rules:
1. Attempting to destroy the ship to win as a stalemate will result in a loss for the species responsible and they will be beamed directly into space.
2. No interference from outside ships or sources. Communication was lost permanently upon random teleport onto the ship.

Team 1: 6 Borg, 2 Predators

Team 2: 3 Aliens and 2 Species 8472

88,"Why does Saavik say ""damn!""?",1594771798,"I know all about the dropped backstory that she was half Romulan -- I'm not asking about whether ""damn"" is a word that makes sense for her character.   What I'm asking is, at that moment on screen, was her character saying ""damn"" because she figured out she was taking the Kobayashi Maru test and knew she was going to lose no matter what she did, or was her character saying ""damn"" because she'd just been told by the computer that the ship in question had 300 passengers, and therefore she must attempt to rescue it (or lose if she doesn't try), regardless of it violating the neutral zone?

I lean towards the latter explanation, given the timing -- she hears ""Kobayashi Maru"" well before she says ""damn"".   I assume they don't swear all the cadets to secrecy about the name of the Kobayashi Maru test and that it is rigged, so she had to have known she was taking that test as soon as she heard the name (or perhaps she had been told she'd be taking the test before it even started, even though that seems unlikely).   So I'm guessing she said ""damn"" because she'd just realized that her options in the simulation had just been eliminated because of there being 300 innocent lives that must be rescued?

But still... it seems odd that she was in any respect ""surprised"" by that moment... surely the Kobayashi Maru was known to and dreaded by all command cadets.   I'm left with the suspicion that Nicholas Meyer put the line in there because it set the desired tone for the audience in that moment, even if it didn't work from a coldly logical standpoint (i.e. it was ""lazy writing"" strictly speaking).",startrek,Sam_Spade-,False,/r/startrek/comments/hrd79i/why_does_saavik_say_damn/
89,The tragedy of Charlie Evans,1594771027,"Charlie Evans from the episode Charlie X is such a fascinating character.  It is very rare to have a character who competently angers you while simultaneously makes you feel bad for him.  A teenager with maturity of toddler but the power of a god.  Everything he does to people it just so evil and sick.  Removing a woman's face for laughing, making people disappear when they make him unhappy, and breaking Mr. Spock's legs just to name a few.  Yet he was socially isolated for so long it is understandable why he didn't develop basic empathy.  He wants to belong but he doesn't understand relationships are a two way street.  I wonder why the Thasians instead of taking him away couldn't have just taken his powers?

19,The culture that survives....,1594731588,"Hey everyone!!! I've been pondering this question a lot lately as I move my way through the various series but I hope its an interesting one that you all could help me with.

I was thinking about what culture survives up until the time Star Trek begins. And I know that a big part of this has to do with production and writing and the time frame of when things are made being too close to the culture when its created. But I'm wondering if we think that the Star Trek universe is an option for the future of humanity, what of our culture will they still be talking about and enjoying?

The question began when I was watching an episode of Voyager and Tom Paris gets a TV from the 50s (maybe the 60s, I forget) and he's watching all these gangster movies and westerns and I thought, why are there no Star Trek people remembering 80s culture? Wouldn't that be sick if there was a Star Trek character as obsessed with 80s punk and goth rock as much as Paris is obsessed with the 30s, 40s, and 50s (which has always struck me as kind of a lame thing about him).

For a while, especially on Next Gen, it seemed to me that the only culture would be classical music and novels. The Doctor in Voyager loves Opera and folk songs and detests hard rock. The characters on DS9 love to spent time in Vince's program (again the 50s). (Thankfully there's that whole episode where Avery Brooks won't go because he says they didn't allow black people back then, which is the coolest part of the culture depicted there (it's real and those characters recognize the implications)).

But it kind of made me a little sad to think that none of the culture I love and enjoy will survive into the future (not to mention we are talking about an entire world/s culture here.)  But also what they remember of us will in fact be ""timeless"" things like classical music. I'm not saying the show did anything wrong because tackling an entire planets culture I doubt is something a show can do. What do you guys think?

Looking forward to hearing your stuff and apologies if this question has already been asked!",startrek,_meanwhile_,False,/r/startrek/comments/hr11sy/the_culture_that_survives/
20,Long Time Star Trek Fan Finally Watches DS9: the end!,1594729273,"What You Leave Behind: I don’t even want to click play because I’m going to cry a whole lot. 

I forgot Kassidy was pregnant. Did I even mention that in the last blog? Oh I forgot Jake was even on this show still. 

I love Worf’s sense of humor. 

“I have an even better reason. Revenge.”
“That works, too.” Kira and Garak work excellently together. I loved watching them burst into laughter when they couldn’t get through the door. She hates that she has to work with him, she finds him deceitful and immoral, and she’s right, but he can do what she can’t, and vice versa. 

The religion plotline is a little off the rails for me. Of course we need a sacrifice. That said Winn’s hair is GORGEOUS. 

When Garak is talking to Julian, crying about the loss of the old Cardassia, I wanted Julian to just whip around and hug him. Neither are the type. But I just needed it. 

Trivia people: is the Admiral’s quote at the peace treaty signing a real earth quote or a made up show quote?

OH ODO. Is there a single blog where I don’t say something like that?

I love that we got to see Vic again. And Quark and Jake, who have been a little absent (although Quark had his moment in the last episode). Oh oops I forgot about the wraiths while Vic was singing. Y’all this got a lil ridiculous. Or a lot. This is just straight up not scifi anymore. Was I still crying when he said goodbye to Kassidy? Of course I am. And now, for obvious reasons I’m crying a WHOLE LOT MORE. Jake was almost the hardest to watch. Because I remember the episode where he spends his whole life getting his father back. And it’s like he was losing him all over again. And then Kira and Odo... 

Sisko left his baseball guys he has to come back.  And we defend the mountain pass tonight. Oh, man, he’s out there, miniSisko. 

I love the message that this had to end because it was beautiful. Because it couldn’t keep on forever and because we have to accept change. 

My one big negative of this episode is that the wraith/prophet plotline had NOTHING to do with the Dominion war. Now, I suppose that makes sense, because they’re two independent events, but honestly, we didn’t need both of them, and the wraith thing got a little out of hand to me. Kassidy being pregnant is also a weird plot point to bring up and then not use for anything. 

Final Series Thoughts: 

My favourite character by a mile was Bashir. He represents so much optimism, so much care. He obviously has his faults: he may be optimistic to the point of naivety, and he’s definitely arrogant. But I think that’s a fair trade off for what he could accomplish with that motivation. Bashir means a lot to me outside of the show as well. I’m always interested in the medical characters on these shows but Bashir is the first one I’ve found totally transfixing. He was also so young when they started which was a really interesting dynamic to me.

Quark was my least favourite character but I did come a long way with him. I found a lot about him and his plotlines distracting from the bigger picture of the show, or even from the other things happening during his episodes. I liked Nog and Rom a lot better, especially Nog, because while he wasn’t trying to deiberately destabilize Ferengi society, he was trying to figure out who he was and how he could fit into it. He also had a really important message about how we can respect our parents and still not want to end up like them. The story of why he wants to join Star Fleet was a real turning point for me and the way that I viewed the entire Ferengi species. 

I also didn’t consistently like Sisko until mid season six. And then, I liked his resolve and I respected him more than anything else. I didn’t like most of his command decisions. I didn’t agree with his ethical stances. But I understand the validity of his arguments and I think that’s more important than completely agreeing. 

Kira had the most growth to me, especially in the last few episodes. Seeing the way she loved Odo  in the end was enchanting. But I do wish we had gotten to know her outside of work and religion.

I think Dax is one of the best overall ideas on this show. There was always something new to learn about her. I loved both Jadzia and Ezri, especially the Klingon episodes or the ones that caused us to learn more about her previous hosts. The episode where Ezri’s brother was a murderer is also one of my favourite episodes in the show. It was sickeningly creepy at points, without being gory. We got to know Ezri but we also saw how the symbiont was changing who Ezri used to be. Not that I minded the gory episodes. Empok Nor was also incredible despite being pretty dark and gory for Star Trek.

Other notable episodes: my favourite was Nor the Battle to the Strong. I loved that the show was willing to talk about and show ground war. I loved Bashir. I even loved Jake in this episode and I very rarely loved Jake (although I also liked the one where he dedicated his whole life to saving his dad and then everything reset). I think Jake led us through an incredibly powerful discussion. I also liked the other ground war episode. 

Shadow Play is one episode that really stuck with me. If we had seen more of Odo like he was in that episode, he would have easily trumped Bashir for my favourite character. The way that he gives love carefully and hesitantly, but completely, is beautiful. The message of that episode, “She’s real to me,” is so personal for me (if you didn’t read my blog on that way back when I wrote it, I highly recommend you listen to the song Netflix Trip by AJR. It’s the exact same feeling. I’m going to listen to that on my way to work and cry because the show is over). All of this is very real to a lot of us because we take something from it into our real lives. I’ve said multiple times that I hope that I learned from Bashir because I think watching him could make me a better person. Odo and Bashir has a very interesting contrast which we see mostly clearly in the episode where Kira’s fake dad died (also an incredible episode). Odo tells Kira very gently that he read the file, and he knows what fake dad did, and he’s choosing to overlook it. She doesn’t tell Kira that she should do the same. He just says that’s the decision he’s made. Julian said that he doesn’t care what he did, he doesn’t deserve to die alone, and Kira should be in that room. Julian cares recklessly, Odo cares cautiously, but they both care entirely. I wish we could have seen more of that from Odo but we just had to keep breaking his heart, didn’t we?

I’m obviously missing a lot of good episodes so everyone please tell me favourite characters and episodes in the comments.

I didn’t mention Worf or Miles yet. I’m grateful both characters were on the show because it made it comfortable for me. It allowed me to again sit with things that helped me grow up, the characters and their beliefs. Also the Miles and Julian scenes were some of the best in the show. When they sang songs getting drunk together, the holosuite scenes. The scene inside Sloan’s head where Miles likes Julian more than his wife. Their argument when Julian wanted to cure the Jem’Hadar of their addiction was incredibly important. Worf had his moments too but he doesn’t stand out the same way. I just love the way he stuck to his beliefs at all times, except when he saved Jadzia. He had a really strong resolve, and I really came to respect Klingons on this show. 

This show had a few bad habits- first, we kept bringing up really cool ideas and then dropping them. Where did the alpha/gamma Jem’Hadar conflict go? What happened to all the changlings that had infiltrated alpha quadrant powers? There were others but I can’t remember them, feel free to point them out!

And the other thing that bothered me, and you guys knew I was going to say this, is that there were rarely consequences for character actions! Just because they had good intentions does not excuse some of that stuff! 

I had an incredible time watching this show. I cried a lot even when characters weren’t dying. I learned a lot from it and from you guys talking about it. It’s darker than most Star Trek, and I’m going to have to figure out how to reconcile Section 31 with my view of the Federation and Star Fleet. But the show also had an inherent sense of honesty. We can’t always find a 1 in 1 million solution. We don’t always win when we take a gamble. We don’t always make the best moral decision. I don’t have to agree with Sisko to know that he did his absolute best at all times.  It also allowed us to pull to real world issues. Bajor had some really good talking points that can be extrapolated to real countries recovering from massive human rights violations. How do you recover?

So... this is the end of DS9. I would love to do another blog if anyone is interested in reading one/chatting with me about another series. I have already watched TOS, TNG, and Enterprise, but it was a long time ago and I would love to blog a rewatch. There was a lot I’ve forgotten from TNG in particular that probably would have helped me understand this one. I haven’t seen Voyager, Picard, or Discovery, and will find a way to watch them if that’s what you guys want. So please tell me what you would be interested in reading/talking about. Also let me know if you have ideas for how I can do the blog better! 

Thank you for those of you who have been reading and participating throughout this. I have honestly loved every second of it.

21,New to Star Trek! Absolutely in love and want more,1594729105,"Hello! I started watching Star Trek with my husband about a year ago and have been loving it. I remembered seeing a few episodes of Next Generation, Deep Space 9, and Voyager as a little girl in the 90s. I enjoyed it then in passing but wanted to watch it in it's entirety now since I had a need to fill the hole for a deeply storied space science fiction that Mass Effect had left. 

We started with Next Gen as I didn't feel like I could stomach the very dated look of the Original Series despite my husband saying that the OG's movies were great. After finishing Next Gen and ~~obsessing~~ adoring it to bits, I agreed to watch the OG series. I gotta say, I loved it. It was campy fun while also having emotional and deep moments. A lot of the writing was dated but like Next Gen, I got to see a science fiction future that seemed quite idealistic and utopic. There weren't a lot of space battles and that was why I enjoyed it a lot: I got to see diplomacy in space held in regard higher than the need for battle, I got to see complexities of humans interacting with other races and cultures, and I got see my fantasy of space exploration on the TV instead of my brain!

Once my husband and I finished the OG series we tackled the movies. I have got to admit that my favorite movies was the Whale one of the OG and Insurrection of Next Gen. The Voyage Home actually made me like Kirk. Up until then my poor husband had to put up with me grumbling about Kirk ( Any time I saw a blonde woman on screen, I said ' oh watch! Kirk will be making googly eyes/kissing her soon ) but this movie just made me appreciate him a lot and recognize his great aspects and better traits as a captain.

We finished DS9 recently ( in love with Alternate Kira! ) and have moved on to Voyager. We're on Season 3 of Voyager and I'm absolutely in love! I didn't remember much from the small bits I saw as a child but I did remember thinking that girls can be badass leaders too ( well, her and Buffy and Xena ) . We plan on moving onto Enterprise next then the Reboot Movies then Discovery and Picard. 

&amp;#x200B;

:D I also saw the Lower Decks trailer! It looks very fun and campy! I look forward to it &lt;3 I heard that there is some courting of Shatner for more Kirk stuff and I hope we get more of him!

&amp;#x200B;

A few questions, if I may?

1. in TNG, what became of that parasitic alien invasion that started with them taking over most admirals? 
2. in TNG, what became of the issue with using high warp speeds? 
3. in DS9, after she-who-shall-not-be-named becomes the Kai, was there a specific reason why the Bajorans couldn't seek council with the previous Kai? She was.... technically still present.

24,"In Defense of Threshold, VOY S2 E15",1594726697,"Okay, so “Threshold” is probably regarded as one of the worst Star Trek episodes ever made, which was surprising to me, a person who likes the episode. If I were to guess the fan reaction to this episode, I would say that “A weird episode that I don’t think of much” but I was blown away by the bad reception it got.

I think the main complaint people have with the episode is that the concept is bizarre, unbelievable and doesn’t make a lot of sense, and to an extent that is true, however I must say that this episode can be fixed with fairly minimal head canon.

Okay so hear me out, people are saying “That’s not how evolution works” because the episode says that what Tom Paris becomes is what Human Beings will become in the future, and evolution does not have a predetermined route for Humanity, but what if what Paris becomes is not a end result but an extrapolation of how Humanity has been evolving in recent centuries. For instance, in the 21st century, air pollution became a big problem, and If the rate of pollution stayed constant for thousands of years then Humans would naturally evolve to stop processing oxygen and starts processing what the atmosphere would have become.

Also he became unable to walk and started to go mad, view that how you like. My point is that this episode is showing us how our actions with out any outside influence at all will end up as Humans becoming what we see in the episode, of course it is quite extreme an there naturally is limits to how polluted the air can get and how mad people can get, but Warp 10 wouldn’t know when to stop.

Also there is the problem of “How does Warp 10 mean being everywhere?” This may be because the Universe simply loops back on itself, in the same way that if you walk across the Earth you’ll eventually end up back when you started, except scaled up a dimension because we’re working with 3D space and not a 2D plane. Assuming this is true then the shuttle traveling at an infinite speed would result in having infinite resolutions around the Universe instantaneously, and slight inclination in the other axis and now you are everywhere.

There is also the issue of “Why doesn’t the shuttle crash into anything?” and this might be because of Plank times and Plank lengths, the shortest possible lengths and the shortest possible times. Light travels at a constant speed in a vacuum of one plank length per plank time, if you were to travel faster than light, you might skip over plank lengths. If you travel fast enough you might even be able to cross great distances without affecting anything in between it because you travel before the universe “updates” so to say. While traveling at infinite speeds you’d naturally cross through every point in the Universe before the next plank time rolls around, thus not affecting anything.

As to why traveling at Warp 10 means you turn into a future version of your species is, I have no Idea, maybe the shuttle crossed the Q continuum and some Qs wanted to mess with him.

Okay perhaps “fairly minimal head canon” wasn’t my best choice in words.

There are also a few other things I like about this episode:

The shuttle is called “Cochrane”.

It throws in a Newton Einstein Surak, to some that is bad, but I love that trope.

Paris’ Buzz Aldrin Speech is good.

The Doctor’s “Wake Up, Lieutenant”.

But what do you think of the episode? Am I just getting to much out of this episode and this is not what the writers intended?

And was Douglas Adams correct to assume that the only way to travel at infinite speeds is through infinite improbability?",startrek,RemmitingFall,False,/r/startrek/comments/hqzwh4/in_defense_of_threshold_voy_s2_e15/
25,"O'Brien is a sympathetic lad but he's not a perfect heroic character by any means. About DS9 S4E3 ""Hippocratic Oath"" (Spoilers)",1594725751,"So what's really relatable about Miles O'Brien in general is that he's this almost ""blue collar"" dude with a tight work ethic, who enjoys his beer and darts. Which is a fun contrast to the more oddball and alien characters in TNG and DS9.

However, O'Brien also occasionally does have problematic prejudiced attitudes towards some entire races or nationalities, such as the Cardassians, hardly a quality desired in Starfleet officers.

But in ""Hippocratic Oath"" O'Brien is truly pushed to a morally murky area. He condemns a dozen or more Jem Hadar to certain death like a cold blooded mofo when he destroys Bashir's work.

Although it is not so clear cut, because you could also make the argument that Bashir was very unlikely to succeed and O'Brien's and Bashir's lives were in danger (almost all of the Jem Hadar had earlier expressed a desire to kill them)

28,I made an AI Dungeon scenario based on Star Trek TOS,1594723156,"[Here is the link](https://play.aidungeon.io/scenario/6604a620-c5b3-11ea-ae95-91f16115aacd https://play.aidungeon.io/scenario/6604a620-c5b3-11ea-ae95-91f16115aacd) if anyone is interested in trying out the scenario.

You play as Capt. Kirk meeting a never before seen mechanical alien race known as the Melborgians. Your goal is to survive the attack. 

Here is the prompt for the scenario (which is only limited to 2000 characters, the next events will be based on what you and the AI will input):

&gt;You are Captain James T. Kirk of the USS Enterprise, a starfleet under the United Federation of Planets.

&gt;Stardate 4523.7, the starship encounters a strange object floating in space. You decide to inspect the object.

&gt;You say “Mr. Sulu, revolve the ship around the object at a radius of 100 meters. Use the scanners to have an estimate of the object’s size and presence of life forms. Lt. Uhura, search for any active signals and hail their captain.”

&gt;Mr. Sulu and Lt. Uhura follow the your orders right away. The elevator doors open and Mr. Spock arrives at the bridge.

&gt;Mr. Spock says “What do we have here captain?”

&gt;You say “We don’t know yet Mr. Spock.”

&gt;Mr. Sulu chimes in and says “Captain, the object's dimensions are 100x150x250 meters. There seem to be no active lifeforms.”

&gt;Lt. Uhura says “That’s odd. If there are no lifeforms, how come someone in the object responded to our signal. They say, they are the Melborgians.”

&gt;Mr. Spock says “Melborgians. Must be a mechanical alien life form since the bioscans weren’t able to detect any organic forms.”

&gt;Lt. Uhura nervously says “Captain, the melborgians say they’re dismantling our ship for their repair protocols.”

&gt;As soon she finished the sentence, the floating object activates a tractor beam and pulls the ship. All of the people in the ship staggers. You hold on to your armrest to maintain balance.

&gt;You shout “Mr. Sulu ready the proton torpedoes! Lt. Uhura patch me to their captain.”

&gt;Lt. Uhura patches you to the Melborgian captain.

&gt;You say “This is Capt. James T. Kirk of the USS Enterprise. We demand you to shut down your tractor beams. This is a violation of the federation laws.”

&gt;The Melborgian captain speaks through the comms with a robotic voice “I am sorry Capt. Kirk but our ship is in dire need of repair. We are the last of our kind, and we must preserve ourselves. According to the data in your ship’s computer, your species are of billions. My analysis shows that our preservation is more important than yours.”

Anyhoo, my main thought is, the SFU is a naturally more gritty and war oriented universe than trek was, but now there's a shift in tone that they want to take trek, but for some reason they want to try and squeeze it into the same timeline as the optimistic and nice future that the trek shows used to try and depict.  This is causing dissonance.

I've not watched it since its first airing and I'm not going to again.  Why?  Well, it's just *boring*.  It's not bad like Move along home.  It's just *dull*.

But... what happened with that monster?  It seemed sentient or at least reacted to people's emotions.  Few questions:

1) Why didn't the Cardassians ever notice this atmosphere-tall energy being attacking Bajor every couple of years?

2) When this entity did attack - and they knew it was coming - why didn't they ask for help?  Like, oh, I don't know, use a comm terminal and ask the provisional government to do something?  Or DS9?

3) Why didn't they all just move away from the giant blob?  Like, why are you still living there, you lunatics?

I know for a fact none of them are mentioned in the show because I know part of the reason I dislike the episode is because it doesn't even try to make sense in any context.  

It's not like Threshold which, although bad, does mostly hold its own internal logic if you turn your brain off.  It's not like Spock's Brain where the writing is so dire it gives you a migrane.

I decided nothing could be gained from watching the series, so I would not waste my money on CBS.

Others watched it, and I listened and I continued to hear things that confirmed my fears. “It doesn’t feel like Star Trek”, “This is just another reboot” “It ignores canon!” etc.

When Picard was announced, I was optimistic. Finally! A show that isn’t a prequel. I subscribed to watch Picard, and I loved it. But then, I started to hear the same criticisms toward Picard, that others had toward Discovery. Again people argued that this wasn’t Star Trek and that it ignored canon. From my perspective, none of those criticisms were accurate, and often the most thought out nitpicking missed (or purposefully ignored) something important. Hell, I was impressed that they remembered the fact that Icheb didn’t have a cortical node.

But all the outrage at Picard made me question whether I was right to feel justified for my knee jerk reaction to Discovery. Yes, the Klingons look awful, but would that eclipse the show if it were good?

Well, I recently binged both seasons, and I loved it. Not only did I love it, I discovered that the criticisms were likely made in bad faith. The show was Star Trek, it didn’t miss the point at all. It focused on the morality, politics, social stigma, the very things I saw growing up with TNG.

83,Long Time Star Trek Fan Finally Watches DS9: Season 7 episodes I forget the rest except the last one,1594646646,"Tacking into the Wind: annnnd there’s my heart, breaking for Odo again. 

I like Julian’s every puzzle has a solution speech but I have a feeling the outcome of this episode is gonna be that brute force is easier. 

Garak standing in the shadows telling Kira to kill the Cardassian dude is creepy as hell! Holy crap. 

The Ezri/Worf conversation was a pretty thinly veiled political statement that is still absurdly applicable today. 

Kira is a different person to me in this episode. She still lacks the personality elements I talked about extensively with some of you in the last blog. But she is so much more loving in this episode. I think this is the first time I’ve described a character on this show with that word. That’s the thing I experienced when she sat down with him. 

The stand off with Cardassian dude, Kira, Garak and Damar was astounding. Funny somehow, intense. Garak still makes me so happy. Wouldn’t kill a Cardassian? Haha silly. Also what got it into Odo’s head that Garak wouldn’t turn right around and tell Kira anyway?

Extreme Measures: oh Odo. Oh, Kira. Oh god. Guys I’m not supposed to cry at the beginning of the episode! But you’ve still gotta love Julian aggressively hitting bullseyes from across the room. 

Sloan’s statement that it’s our actions, not our beliefs, that define who we are, hits pretty hard. Probably hits Julian especially badly, considering he’s now participated in Sloan’s game by accident. 

I totally loved this episode. Julian had to make some tough decisions here. He knew Sloan would do anything and everything possible not to let him have the cure. He should have been a little more prepared for something like that. Sloan also played right into Julian’s character flaws. We also got some of the absolute best Julian and Miles scenes in the whole show. I also love that Miles is the answer here. Julian’s major flaw is that arrogance, the feeling like he can do everything alone and he has all the answers. He is so lonely that it doesn’t even occur to him to ask for help. But there’s Miles when he won’t ask but still needs it. I love that messaging. I love the outcome because I was honestly pretty convinced Odo was going to die.

I do think Julian compromised on his ideals kind of a lot. I think if I follow the moral guidelines I’ve laid out for myself along this show, I have to condemn the whole kidnapping and torture situation, keeping him just barely alive until they could dig around in his head. Was it okay? Probably not. This show almost treats loss of life like a financial transaction. They got a good deal on this one. Julian may be able to save all of the Founders now. Sloan committed attempted genocide and I think his life is worth all of those others, bad guys or otherwise. What I can say for absolute sure is that Sloan is not a good guy to me. And the Federation does not deserve to win this way. In fact, they sort of prove the Founder’s point by killing them this way. Now, they’re not any better. But why even fight a war if you’re going to cause just as much devastation as they do? When the Founder’s attacked earth, they attacked Star Fleet. Just Star Fleet. They didn’t murder every human on the planet. 

The Dogs of War: I love Garak casually walking by in the background in the Jem’Hadar headpiece saying, “I’ll handle it.” That was just hysterical to me. It pretty much summarizes his calm, background lurking and meddling with things. 

Okay you guys win Julian and Ezri are adorable. Holy crap it’s so dorky and works so well when they actually try to confront it. Julian was smiling so big for the first time in awhile. It makes me so happy when he smiles like that. 

Oh poor Kassidy. Remember when I said how devastating it must have been for her when Sisko briefly called off the wedding because of the wormhole aliens? This is what I meant by that.

The most major thing here was the Kira/Damar/Garak plotline. I didn’t love it as much as I loved Julian and Miles in the last episode. I like all three of these characters, Damar’s hero speech was just a little awkward to me. It’s funny because it pretty much fits the trope of one of Julian and Miles’ holosuite programs. He’s the legendary hero of the story, just realistic enough to be on the far side of believable. It has power and merit, I just found it less interesting. It was also very Cardassian which was interesting. There was an aspect of valor to it. I liked Kira’s last episode better. Obviously this episode was more or less Damar’s episode but it just wasn’t my favourite. So, in general... meh. 

One more episode, guys! I don’t want this to be over but here we are. This will probably end up in a second blog tonight but I have to do all my final portfolio work for class today so we’ll see.

After the first time they go down though, she's back on the Enterprise doing desk work for the rest of the episode and kind of forgotten about, even though they went back down to the planet several more times. 

And of course the translator does fail but she's not around, so Archer has to improvise with what would be considered today as an unwanted advance.

I have to say, I’m actually kind of curious to see this show when it’s out.

It’s whole set up sounds pretty random, but maybe it could work.

It’s focused on the younger, lower ranked crew members, which is definitely different, but an interesting perspective to take. I haven’t watched Discovery, though some say that show kind of goes into that idea, correct me if I’m wrong.

It’s animated, fun fact, there was a Star Trek animated series in the 70s, its kind of obscure outside the fandom, but it exists. There’s definitely some potential in the Trek verse being animated.

It’s a comedy, other Trek shows have their funny moments (both intentional and unintentional) but comedy is almost never the focus. The trailer for this show definitely gave me a Galaxy Quest vibe, it definitely feels like a self parody, again, fine.

Finally, it’s been done by the same crew behind Rick and Morty and Solar Opposites, same art style, humor, and all that, I wouldn’t be surprised if Justin Roiland has a voice role on this show at some point. This is probably the strangest thing about this show.  Rick and Morty is nihilistic, Star Trek is optimistic, how are those two things going to mesh? It could work, I’m just not sure how.
