I feel like generally speaking the last two installments in the trilogy are the most decisive. However just because fans feel that way, doesn't mean TFA is the best movie of the three to any one person. Lucas always wanted something new that pushed the boundaries of storytelling and the franchise, something that took risks.

24,Making a Star Wars movie is actually easy yet is held back by bad writers.,1594335599,"Everything has been already built by the the previous movies which should make making a movie much easier, yet the sequel is a disappointment and basically a garbage movie, people can disagree but at the end it’s a fact that the sequel had a lot of plot holes and also mistakes like the whole ship going light speed when in comic it was explained that they simply go into another dimension to reach these destinations.

This shows that the writer didn’t even prepare for the movie, what is crazy is the fact that making a Star Wars movie is easy since they can use comic or build something using the previous material in previous movies.

 I have seen a fan fiction story where the story is similar with Harry Potter with the school thing but it’s about youngling who trains by a Jedi but gets followed by another kid who turns out to be the feelings and rage of darth Vader and he is only seen by the protagonist and is affecting the protagonist and trying to make him stronger and make him turn into the dark side.

This and a lot of other fan fictions were just really good and made by hardcore fans, and they know the basics and know a lot about the universe of Star Wars unlike the writer and the director who both were lazy to even look at the comic and try to understand how easy it is to make Star Wars movies, they literally could’ve made movie about luke Skywalker family, the past of Jedi and Seth, the journey of darth Vader between him being burned and meeting his son and much more yet we ended up this movie.

The first side say that the force was always a plot device.
The second say it isnt and should have limitations. 
Now there was no mention of how a jedi/sith uses certain powers.
Do they train? Do they have it as a gift?can anyone hear from the objects like cal kestis and the dude from clone wars?
Can anyone forceheal like rey or baby yoda? If so anakin's turn to the dark side is completely meaningless.
And so on but the most powerful force ability is the fcking veil of the force from rebels.
Spoilers now i liked this episode but it just  raised a lot of questions. If you haven't watched it here is the short story ezra bridger a jedi finds a site that was built by like the symbols of the force the father the son and the daughter this site has a sort of magical door that can be opened by a force user when its opened ezra enters the veil of the force which is literally time travel. Unpopular opinion i hate time travel stories they are confusing sometimes and create some big plotholes.
Ezra saves ahsoka tano from being killed by vader, anakin's padawan. Spoilers for clone wars season 7.
Ahsoka knows when anakin fell to the dark side she heard it as shown in S7 of clone wars.why didnt he save anakin from the fall to the dark side. Pull anakin before he cuts mace's arm. And even if you say that palpatine was after them in the veil ahsoka which literally wanted to sacrifice herself for him to return or end up killing him, would do everything she can to bring anakin to the light and/or stop the empire from happening by pulling him out even if it meant killing him",StarWars,COLDCYAN10,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hod6l7/someone_needs_to_explain_the_limitations_of_the/

31,How did you picture Luke and Leia’s parents?,1594334114,"With the popular painting on this sub and the question how people pictured the Clone Wars, I thought I should ask how people pictured Anakin and Luke and Leia’s mother. I myself did picture Anakin to be older, closer to Obi-Wan’s age even. I’m not sure how I pictured his clothes. When he was seduced by the dark side I obviously pictured them to be black. That’s a given. Considering how large Vader is I did think he was much bigger than Hayden is. I’m not complaining, but that’s just how I pictured him. I didn’t expect him to be as emotional because I didn’t really think about his relationship with the mother of Luke and Leia. I pictured him more stoic. 

As for the mother, I did think that she married Bail Organa after Anakin’s fall and that she lived on Alderaan for a while until she died when Leia was at a young age. I didn’t think much of how she looked like. I could only go by Leia’s words, that she was very beautiful, kind, but sad. So I just thought that she wasn’t really in love with Bail Organa and why Luke lived with uncle Owen and aunt Beru was a mystery to me. They explained why, but poor Luke lol.

32,A friendly reminder that ALL (canon) Star Wars films will be on Disney Plus tomorrow morning,1594333952,"Solo was the last holdout with a Netflix contract that ran through today. If you've been avoiding Solo, I'd highly recommend giving it a chance. To me, it captures the spirit of Star Wars just as much as the Mandalorian and is my favorite of the Disney era films (sorry Rogue One). Also, in the extras section of TLJ, they put the score only version! I have my issues with the film, but watching the score only version with the beautiful cinematography is an enjoyable experience that I recommend to any John Williams fan. In fact, most of the SW films have tons of extras that I only recently discovered. I've seen all of them already on discs, but its nice to have them available to stream.

38,Ships for a bounty hunter and their crew,1594332174,"Hey everyone!

I’m starting a D20 Star Wars table top RPG campaign. My character is essentially a bounty hunter / republic commando hybrid with a bit of tech skills and engineering woven in.

My DM has said at this point in his career he’d have a ship, and I should look into what I’d like to bring to the party (within reason).

I don’t know a lot of ships, and I was hoping the SW community could help!

Things I’d need:

Reasonable firepower (like Slave 1).
Large enough for the party, holding cells, and a tech bay.
Not so large that it’s empty. The character is typically a loner prior to the campaign.

A light freighter, like The Falcon or Dash Rendar’s ship, are easy go-to’s, but I couldn’t find much info on ships this size, even in the Rulebooks. And I don’t want to be cliche by picking a YT frigate.

What are some ships other that might fit the bill? Any setting or era is fine, as it’s a homebrew setting.

I am making these for absolutely no reason whatsoever, but I decided to post the first bit here, to hear what people think. If you feel inclided to do so, it would mean a lot to me.

I’ve just finished my Star Wars marathon so I’ve watched all 11 films in order (Solo, Rogue One, ANH, TMSB, ROTJ, TPM, AOTC, ROTS, TFA, TLJ and TROS), I will be watching the series and I’m excited for those since I haven’t watched them before but overall the best Star Wars film (in my opinion) has to be Revenge Of The Sith. I’ve chose this one because it really shows how Kenobi and the Jedi fail anakin and how the emperor manipulates the whole of the senate and the Jedi just for anakin to become his apprentice and how anakin will do anything to save padme by destroying the Jedi and the music is brilliant so props to John Williams and the choreography for the duel between obi wan and anakin is amazing! Also it’s a great ending to the prequel trilogy. 

So that’s why I’ve chosen revenge of the sith as my favourite. Feel free to debate with me in the comments lol and I will be watching the series too soon 😊",StarWars,Itz_Roo,False,/r/StarWars/comments/ho5uvp/just_finished_my_star_wars_marathon/

30,Han Solo's old deleted girlfriend; could she become Qi'ra?,1594307150,"For those that remember, there was an alternate take of the scene in A New Hope where Han Solo meets with Luke and Obi-wan.  As they're sitting down Han is sitting there with a woman but she gets up shortly after and he calls her ""sweetheart.""  I know it wasn't intended to be an ongoing character but knowing what we now know about Solo's past, what are the chances this could've been one of the last times we saw Qi'ra?  

As far as I'm aware, we don't know what happened to them between Solo: A Star Wars Story and A New Hope.  I know they split up at the end of the movie but that doesn't mean that was the last time they saw each other.  Plenty of chances for them to have more interactions between those two movies.  Maybe they ended up as a much more casual thing as he now doesn't really trust her at all.

The main thing I don't like about this theory myself is that what happens to her after this point?  If he had any sort of feelings for her they sure disappeared sometime after A New Hope.  It's not like he ends up with Leia by the end of the movie so maybe there was some more closure between A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back.  Or maybe he even ended up with Leia as a way to bury the remainder of his feelings for Qi'ra.

I wasn't sure if there were any books or comics that covered this ground between the movies that is canon.  It is a fun thought though.",StarWars,MysterClark,False,/r/StarWars/comments/ho4obn/han_solos_old_deleted_girlfriend_could_she_become/

It feels like you can go on the internet and see non stop praise for the sequels or prequels some days, and on other days you'll see non stop hate for them. Why can't the community discuss the films in a civilized manner rather than tearing people to shreds for preferring a to b?

15,My Star Wars game idea,1594268277,"Ok so they don’t cover how Rex Gregor and wolffe get to where they are in the Star Wars universe and I think I would be a cool idea to cover that through a canon game. The game would start a little after where the last clone wars episode left off where you play as rex. You don’t go with Asoka temporary hiding instead you try to find other clones who haven’t been inflicted by order 66. You start by finding Gregor because Rex knows he doesn’t have an inhibitor chip then you find Wolffe who for some un-canon (or unknown to me) survived order 66. You keep on the search maybe find a normal clone and he dies in the game or find a training facility with some surviving trainees who die in battle with storm troopers. Eventually death Vader hears 3 clones survived and senses in the force one of them is Rex. He takes a solo mission to find them. When he encounters them I think the conversation would go like this. Vader : Rex, join me and become the commander of the grandest army the galaxy has ever seen. Rex : Anakin Listen to me, you chose the wrong side, the Chancellor manipulated you to become a machine. Vader : Anakin is no more he was a fool. Rex : a fool? A fool won the battle of geniosis? a fool trained the best Padwan I’ve ever seen? a fool led the best clone squad? A fool was chosen by the force to save it? But yes a fool struck down his master and a fool betrayed the democracy he fought for. Vader : to me you are just a clone a clone with a blue strip on his helmet. Rex : I’m sorry Commander. Rex then shoots off part of Vader’s breathing equipment and makes his escape. Vader can’t pull himself to use the force on Rex Wolffe and Gregor so he lets them escape unharmed. The game ends when they take down a small squad of storm troopers and steal their at at and convert it to what we see in rebels.

Recently I’ve been rewatching TCW in chronological order, as I watched a lot of it when I was younger but remember almost nothing. I’m mid way through season 5 and saw that in the official chronological episode order, season 7 is out of order. The order is 705-708, 701-704, 709-712. 

I was under the impression that the show was out of order mostly because of episodes not being ready, and in other cases prequel episodes were written later on for the most popular episodes (like Rookies). With Season 7 not under TV deadlines and only being a single season, I can’t see how any of these would apply. 

So, is it better to watch it in chronological order? Or are 705-708 written to be “prequel” episodes and intended to be viewed as such?

33,Darth Sidious ( Ambush Predator) AND Darth Maul (Pursuit Predator).,1594261266,"I watched a documentary about Ambush Predators and the way that they hunt. **Ambush predators** or **sit-and-wait predators** are carnivorous animals that capture or trap prey by stealth or camouflage or by strategy.

Darth Sidious does this very well he lies in wait behind the scenes waiting for the right time to strike. He camouflages himself as Palpatine pretending to be a innocent senator from Naboo but he really is a wolf in sheep's clothing. 

Now Darth Maul is a **pursuit predator** in which predators that give chase to fleeing prey. he stalks his prey then chases his prey killing them by brute force. This is what happens in episode one when Darth Sidious sent Darth Maul to pursue Padme, Obi Wan Kenobi and Qui Gon Jinn.

37,DISCUSSION: Has anyone made this yet?,1594259553,"Never posted here before because I would only consider myself a casual Star Wars fan. I like the originals and Force Awakens and Rogue One, have kind of a (completely unobjective) soft spot for Revenge of the Sith, and pretty much had no feelings either way on everything else. But what always interests me are fan-edits of movies. Ever since I made my Suicide Squad fan-edit, I've been thinking of other movies that could potentially be fixed in editing.

And then I thought about the Star Wars prequels. Now not one of them could be saved in editing. But each of them has some great parts to it. Which got me thinking about combining them together. Plenty of fan-editors have done them, even Topher Grace. But the more I think about it, combining all of them in a linear order would feel weird. There'd be no sense of flow or act structure.

But something hit me just like 15 minutes ago and I needed to get the idea down. What if it was Non-Linear? What if the prequels were all edited together in a Christopher Nolan-esque non-linear story?

Now obviously one of them needs to be chosen as the base plot, from which the flashbacks will occur. It seems natural it would be Revenge of the Sith, seeing as how it's the only one with any semblance of quality. The story could then flash between Episodes 1 and 2. Perhaps even pull a Memento and show half of the story in reverse order? Nah, that'd be a little too out there. But it could be done.

It'd also need a singular focus, so that easy chunks could be cut out. The brotherhood between Anakin and Obi-Wan would be the focus. Perhaps if there was enough good material to fill two movies (Doubt it) one could focus heavily on each. But that seems unlikely. It would all culminate in contrasting Obi-Wan's devotion to Qui-Gon with Anakin's fall from grace. Master and Apprentice.

The only sticking point then is the numbering. There have to be 3 full episodes before the original Star Wars. I guess you could make Episode 2 as Solo and Episode 3 as Rogue One though.

46,Sequel Trilogy Fix Idea,1594258373,"If Rey had been a apprentice of Luke’s before Ep 7 and at some point had trained alongside Ben I feel the narrative issues many of us have with the Force characters could have been smoothed out; and without too many changes to what we got.

For ep 7 it gives Rey a past that can explain how she’s such a great pilot, technician, and fighter then she could have a hidden motivation for not wanting to look for Luke.

It could explain Luke’s hostility towards her in Ep 8.  She left him for some reason—before the destruction off the temple—and maybe Snoke/Palpatine had a hand in that too along with turning Ben to the Dark Side.

It could give more meaning to Ben’s obsession with her.  In ep 7 when the officer or whoever tells Ren that the droid escaped with the help of a girl and his reaction is angry and uses a Force pull and asks “what girl”—he could be suspecting he found his old co-Padawan.

In episode 8 the Force connection between Ben and Rey gets a lot more meaning as we learn they had both trained under Luke.

Then she could still have been a Palpatine.  In ep 9 Luke said he and Leia knew the truth about her family so nothing needs to change there...but all the interactions in that last movie between her and Ben and Luke and Palpy would have had so much more context.

Then it helps to open the door for the adventures of Rey and Ben while they were training together—maybe on Tatooine which explains why she ends up there at the end—and at that time they’d be teens or very young adults which totally hits the mark for Disney.

So that’s my big idea.  I expect that many of you will eviscerate it but regardless thanks for reading.",StarWars,MPFX3000,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hnu1rz/sequel_trilogy_fix_idea/
47,A newcomers first impressions on the star wars series,1594258118,"Hello fellow Jedi (cringe I know but couldn't come up with another wat to start this)

I'm a newcomer to the series and have decided to jot down on this sub my opinions on each star wars movie for you all to laugh at!! I have never watched a star wars film before this year but did watch a new hope and empire strikes back in April and didnt watch the rest or them for some reason.

I will be updating this post over the course of the next week or so as I watch everything to do with star wars and maybe have some fun along the way

So without further ado here are my opinions on STAR WARS

A New hope: I'm going to be honest i didnt enjoy this film that much. It was OK. The film had good qualities such as its cast, creativity, soundtrack and boldness but its bogged down by some lackluster cinematography and editing (the action scenes in particular suffered from this, when the camera would constantly switch between shots in a ugly way), cheesy dialogue and weak character arcs. I also found it kind of dragged on

Empire strikes back: great. This movie did literally everything better then a new hope. The actions scenes were shot beautifully and the dialogue felt more natural. I still found myself checking how long was left in the movie several time but to a lesser extent to a new hope. However I'm not sure how much I personally enjoyed it. Its objectively great but I didnt feel myself enjoying it as much as I want to.",StarWars,alphafire616,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hntzg0/a_newcomers_first_impressions_on_the_star_wars/

He kicks Obi-Wan off the edge and he falls onto the lower ledge and then slips off that but grabs on for a few moments. Qui-Gon never seems to react to this. I know he was fighting such a deadly opponent but it still feels weird he doesn't call for him to see if he's ok. From where Obi-Wan falls Qui-Gon shouldn't be able to see him fall if you watch the fight. And given how thin those ledges are compared to the giant chamber they're in he could have easily fallen to his death. If I were Qui-Gon I would have tried to back away from Maul to see if Obi-Wan was still hanging on. Even during the bit with the force fields where Qui-Gon can break from fighting he doesn't even turn around to check if Obi-Wan had rejoined the fight as if he totally forgot about him.,StarWars,Atalkingpizzabox,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hnr5fx/something_odd_about_the_phantom_menace_i_dont/

43,I hope future series and movies have a profound effect as the ones before had,1594232234,"It’s probably nostalgia kicking in and being a kid when I, II, and III hit screens. Being a kid and remembering seeing I when I was 4 was fantastic, and subsequently II and III. Seeing all of them had such a profound effect that I feel can never be replicated. 

A tradition that my brother and I started with the sequels was seeing them at the very first showing in IMAX with one of our friends. His friend looked at it as welcoming him into our family since he didn’t have someone to do the movies with. Just VII on its own was the highlight and something that can’t be replicated. VIII had so much hype and it wasn’t what we expected, which is fine, but not what we wanted. By the time IX rolled around, well, it became an obligation. My brother asked me on the phone once before tickets were on sale and it was a “do we have to do this?” It’s unfortunate it got to this. 

I just hope that the next series of movies won’t feel like great, well it Star Wars so I guess we have to go. I want it to be a memorable thing much like what the movies meant for me growing up or for the sequels (at the beginning) for my brother’s friend.

57,My Fan Fic's first chapter. Alternate universe,1594201735,"**Star Wars: Reverse, Season I, Chapter 1**

The sun begun showing above the horizon, and it shine reflected on a sky house.

White walls of the house started to become more and more yellow.

On the balcony of this sky house four people standing – two kids and two adults were standing.

It was the Skywalker family. Their kids, twins Leia and Luke Skywalker were saying final goodbyes to their mother, Padme.

Smiling, Padme was hugging her dear kids while crying.

– Mommy, why are you crying? – Luke asked.

– D-don’t worry about it... I’m just so happy for you… You are my little heroes – Padme was saying through the tears.

Leia’s and Luke’s father, Anakin hugged her, but Padme haven’t stopped crying.

– Please mommy, don’t cry, – Leia said. – We are going to cry too!

– Padme, dear, everything is going to be alright, okay? – said Anakin.

Padme calmed down, while proudly looking at her kids – despite the twins being only five years old, she already viewed them as grown ups.

Finally, Anakin said:

– Okay, we need to get ready, the lessons are going to start soon.

– Finally! We are going to become Jedi! – Luke and Leia screamed.

Anakin looked at Padme, and she smiled through tears again, said to her beloved:

– Take care of them Ani, please.

– I promise you, Padme, I will protect them with my life, – Anakin said seriously.

Anakin kissed his wife goodbye and walked with kids to his ship. Luke and Leia were smiling and waving, as the ship disappeared from Padme’s sight.

Padme didn’t know how to feel about this whole idea, and was torn.

When they were flying, Luke was excitedly pointing at whatever objects and buildings, while Leia got her head covered in her knees. *Finally, she is going to be a Jedi*.

– Kids, we are near the Jedi Temple! – announced Anakin.

The kids glued their faces to the glass of the ship, hoping to seen the Temple for the first time.

They never ever saw anything like this.

The Temple was huge, with five white towers, that were majestically towered over the city.

When Anakin and his kids landed, Leia was shocked at how enormous the Temple was compared to her. Kids just stood there with their mouths and eyes opened wide, while Anakin was sarcastically smiling.

When they entered the Temple, Leia and Luke felt that they were insects, while walking through white corridors with tall ceilings.

Anakin got the kids to a big room, crowded with other little kids, some of who did not looked like normal humans.

Anakin kneeled, and whispered to his children the final instructions:

– Remember, kids. From now on, I’m *Master Skywalker* to you, understood?

The kids just nodded silently. They were hearing it for hundreds time, and they **were** prepared, but they still felt like a giant ice cube was dropped inside them.

– Goodbye, kids, I need to go now. – Anakin said, looking ashamed, as he was leaving his kids at the time of need. – Your homeroom master, Obi-Wan Kenobi is going to take care of you now, please, listen to him.

Leia and Luke looked at their father, and silently nodded.

When Anakin left the room, Leia got closer to the younglings.

– Hi, my name is Leia! – She said excitedly, – and I have a brother, Luke!

Younglings looked interested, and crowded around her.

– Hey, I’m Perry, – one little boy introduced himself. I’m from Alderaan.

– I’m from here, – Leia said.

Perry smiled at Leia, and she smiled in return.

But, as soon as Leia started to know her new classmates, a man entered the room.

– Hello, future Jedi, – he started talking. My name is Obi-Wan Kenobi, I’m going to be your homeroom master for the rest of your studies in the Temple. He was talking very emotionlessly.

– Firstly, please introduce yourselves, Obi-Wan asked.

And then, the whine rose. Lots of different names poured down:

*– Leia!*

*–Neil-le!*

*– Perry!*

*– Luke!*

– Okay, okay, stop – Obi-Wan thought he was going to get deaf.

When the whine stopped, Obi-Wan asked them again, and now everyone replied right after each other.

– Follow me to your classroom, – he asked.

Younglings uncomfortably followed Obi-Wan, but this awkwardness vanished, when they entered the classroom.

&amp;#x200B;

The classroom was filled with white desks, on behind, there was a seemingly fluffy carpet, and a little bookcase.

Younglings took their places, and looked at their master.

– Okay… Hello future Jedi, and… Let’s start our studies with our history lesson.

I’m going to tell you about our Temple, and why it is a legendary building.

Little younglings looked at each other on confusion. Why is their master decided to talk about such a boring subject?

Obi-Wan started talking, and he was talking about the most boring things – Leia only understood those words – “Jedi, history, honor, Force”…

Obi-Wan continued blabbering, lots of 15 younglings fell asleep.

&amp;#x200B;

Obi-Wan only finished after a whole 1 hour.

– Was it interesting? – Obi-Wan asked.

– Yeah…. – woken up kids were saying sleepily.

– Okay, I now go to bring practice materials. – Obi-Wan said. Wait here a little. And exited the classroom.

– It was booring! – Leia said. I wanted to sleep the whole time.

“He needs to be taught a lesson”, Leia thought.

Suddenly, Leia spotted a sink in the corner of the classroom. She had an idea.

She took a big cup, filled it with water, and with hard time placed it on the top of the door.

– What are you doing? – Youngling monster asked.

– Setting up a trap to our master. You don’t get to be boring and get away with it, – Leia said.

Leia said it loud enough for everyone to hear. Everyone already hated their new master, so they decided not to interfere.

&amp;#x200B;

– I hear him! – Luke whispered.

Kids sat at their desks, looking as an absolutely angels.

When Obi-Wan entered the room… A cold water was thrown at him.

He was standing there, shocked, angry and wet while kids were laughing at his look like there is no tomorrow.

62,"I really don't like the prequel trilogy, and the newfound love for them astounds me (in both good and bad ways).",1594200511,"Risking my karma by posting this, and it's more than likely I'll get downvoted into oblivion, but I'll post my thoughts anyway.

The prequel trilogy was my introduction to the world of Star Wars, being an early 2000s kid. I remember being really confused by The Phantom Menace, irked out by Attack of the Clones, and enjoying the second half of Revenge of the Sith. But I never saw the appeal of Star Wars like my dad had always talked about, until I saw the original trilogy of course. I was around 10, and I couldn't get enough of them. The prequels, over time, held less significance as I developed into a fan of Star Wars, like so many of us now. 

Before the release of The Force Awakens, I rewatched the prequels for the first time in what must have been at least 4 years, and I'm sad to say I admired them even less. I was on the way to pursuing an education in film (seeing Whiplash and Birdman was singlehandedly responsible for this) and I thought I would be able to see the trilogy in a different light. I couldn't stand the overly choreographed lightsaber battles, horrendous dialogue and the occasionally off-putting CGI. Then the sequel trilogy was released, and the prequels faded back into the recesses of my mind once again as my attention shifted to the new films.

Now, the sequel trilogy has concluded, I'm a third year film student, and I noticed the resurgence of love for the prequels. They'd woven their way into pop culture just as the originals did, with the Order 66-focused Fallen Order and Clone Wars S7 (both pretty solid) bring developed and releasing most likely due to this renewed interest. Not to mention all the popular memes. So I thought, what the heck. Time to revisit the prequels again. I sat down with my DVDs I'd gotten those 10 or so years ago and began. 

Sad to say, I like them even less. I feel that, with time, the bad things have aged to become worse and the good things don't really hold up (apart from Williams' amazing compositions of course). I don't see where the love is coming from, if I'm being honest. I think, with the exception of Ewan McGregor, most of the cast is really awful. The direction is pretty much nonexistent as is any believable dialogue. It all feels so staged, and our protagonist, Anakin Skywalker, isn't at all compelling until the third one, something I can't say of the other two main heroes in the other trilogies. 
What's always drawn me to Star Wars has never been the planets, the Jedi, the Sith, the ships, blasters, aliens or the lightsabers. Those are just the cherries on top for me but the characters have to be the bedrock. And I found almost no believable heroes or villains in these films. But if you like them, that's great. I respect that. I just wish there wasn't as much focus on the prequels as there is in the fanbase right now; pretty much 50% of this subreddit's new content seems like prequel stuff to me.

(The memes also make it kind of unbearable to me? Almost every single line in Episode III can't be taken seriously any more because of them.)

66,The Worst Part of Revenge of the Sith (Sort of Rant),1594197414,"Revenge of the Sith is one of my favorite Star Wars movies. I like to consider it the Revival of the Prequels because of just how well it matched up and helped add to the overall story of Star Wars. Anakin is actually a great character in ROTS, and Obi-Wan is brighter than ever. The soundtrack is some of the best in the entire franchise, the effects still hold up rather well at times, and we can't forget just how epic those lightsaber duels are.

However, there's one problem. One singular scene that just frustrates me to unbelievable ends. The infamous ""Rank of Master"" scene involving Mace Windu and its aftermath.

I need to talk about this here and now because it simply frustrates me. The scene goes like this: Anakin wants the rank of Jedi master, and Mace Windu says that, while Anakin is on the Council, he is not given the rank of Master. Later, when Anakin talks to Obi-Wan, Anakin brings up that this is the first time this dilemma has ever happened. Ever. In the history of the Jedi.

This is the one part of the movie that frustrates me, because, in my opinion? Anakin is at least mostly in the right for once. Everyone who is on the Council is a Jedi Master. Yoda, Mace Windu, Obi-Wan, everybody. Why in the holy mother of Dagobah does Anakin have to be exempt from this apparent rule? Why did he have to be the exception? There is the fact that he is a Jedi, and him being upset is wrong, but I don't blame Anakin for getting worked up about something that really does seem true.

Now, some people could say that Anakin is simply too emotional. Too fearful, angry, filled with hatred. This does have some sense. They don't want him to be a Jedi Master because he seems power hungry. If this is the case, though, then why did they even put him on the Council in the first place? Why was he ever even considered the Chosen One? Granted, he proves that he is in the end, but this happens in Episode 6! All the friggin original Jedi are DEAD by this point! Why was he even given the position when he was a risky choice to even become a Jedi in the first place?

I simply don't understand the logic of the Jedi Masters in this scene, or any of their choices with Anakin before it. Mace Windu later even says that he does not trust Anakin. If Anakin is not trusted, then why is he even a part of the Jedi Order!? WHY!? What good reason is there for him to be there other than to fulfill his dreams and the fact that he's supposedly the Chosen One out of some prophecy that's BARELY even believed?

Pisses me off. Am I in the wrong here? Do my points make any sense? Or do I just sound stupid?

82,Would anybody like to see the sequels rewritten?,1594188589,"When it comes to the Star Wars sequel trilogy, there’s a lot of polarized dichotomy: people either love it or hate it. I’ve personally had some friends that loved it on a first viewing but now hate it after additional viewings and discussions. I’m sure I’m not alone when I say that the movies are very well done, at least visually, but are severely lacking in story and character development. Recently, I had the idea of jotting down a list of relatively small changes to try and fix the stories. It’s gotten to the point where it compounded into rewriting the story completely, or at least enough that it’s starkly different from the movies. It needs to be flushed out a bit more but otherwise is more or less only lacking dialogue.

86,Rian Johnson Understands Star Wars must adapt to survive.,1594188423,"Rian Johnson understands why the Disney’s mission statement of Star Wars is flawed.

Rian Johnson understands why the state of Star Wars of the Disney era is flawed

Bob igers mission statement has always been about appeasing people and not about good filmmaking or making fresh innovative content. 

We’d intentionally created a world that was visually and tonally connected to the earlier films, to not stray too far from what people loved and expected, and George was criticizing us for the very thing we were trying to do.” 

Yes because while TLJ was also made to appease fans in Rians PoV he never wanted too and nor is he obligated too as a creative. 

The last Jedi says Let the past die. Kill it, if you have to” but that’s not what the movie says and it’s illustrated when Luke talks to yoda and yoda says 

Heeded my words not, did you? Pass on what you have learned. Strength, mastery. But weakness, folly, failure also. Yes, failure most of all. The greatest teacher, failure is. Luke, we are what they grow beyond. That is the true burden of all masters.

so must Star Wars as a franchise if it’s going to keep adding more and more stories to its franchise. Respect its past, learn from it, and let it go and move on. Do entirely new things 

But that’s not the case with the Force Awakens and The Rise of skywalker, solo and rogue one which are heavily based on nostalgia and reusing past characters a lot of people didn’t like palpatine coming back, Rey being a stereotypical main character related to someone evil who she has to not have that define her Just like Luke because JJ and Disney for the most part is obsessed with the past. 

But there is a silver lining that illustrates if they take the last Jedis words to heart to just do new and interesting things with the brand that are director driven good and creative despite backlash which lets be real, people who hated the last Jedi they still saw the rise of skywalker lol. That is Mandalorian and whatever amazing thing Taika is cooking up a long with Feige etc. but Rian understands Star Wars will be a stale brand if you don’t get new fresh ideas and not rely on nostalgia for cash.

14,Ratts Tyerell survived in deleted/added scene... or is it the Mandela Effect?,1594179190,"This has been killing me for the last 24 hours. I was watching The Phantom Menace yesterday along with a Youtuber who was doing commentary. Afterwards, I went into the comments to see what everyone had to say since it was a young, new fan doing the commentary and not some old curmudgeon with warped ideas of what the PT should've been. I noticed someone said ""RIP Ratts Tyerell"" and I was just about to respond and say ""Ratts lived! He was seen on a stretcher after the race. It was either added in the movie or in a deleted scene."" But since I couldn't remember the details or the exact spot the scene happened, I went back to the ending of the podrace to see if I could find it so I could timestamp it for the commenter. I couldn't find it, so I decided to look in the deleted scenes from the DVD, Blu-ray and Disney Plus. I still couldn't find it. I was like, hmm, I could've sworn that I've seen a scene of Ratts being carried away on a stretcher, after the race, in a blink-and-you-miss-it background shot while Anakin was celebrating his win. So I asked other SW fans I know IRL and they all remember Ratts surviving in an added scene or deleted scene. They remember it how I remember it. But here's the weird thing: I can't find any evidence of it. And every site I check out that references Ratts as a character says that he died for sure. There is nothing that I could find that confirms he lived. I found one site where a member said Ratts was seen carried on a stretcher while his family followed behind, during the scene where Qui-Gon asks Watto to release Anakin. I've seen that scene multiple times and all I see is some other alien walk by, then Ratts' family, with his sad wife's head in her hands. Another commenter from a different site said Ratts corpse can be seen carried on a stretcher by two pit droids in the hanger after the race, while Jar Jar lifts up Anakin. I checked that scene out and it doesn't look like Ratts to me. It looks like two pit droids carrying a third pit droid on a stretcher, possibly the one that was sucked into the engine while Ody Mandrell did a pit stop. 

So what does everyone remember? Did Ratts survive or not? Was his clearly alive body seen being carried on a stretcher in any added scene or was it in a deleted scene? How can several people remember Ratts being carried on a stretcher if the scene is not in the movie or in any deleted scene?",StarWars,Darth-Binks-1999,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hn9nqf/ratts_tyerell_survived_in_deletedadded_scene_or/

25,Fan Fic scene of Sidious and Dooku discussing a plan to turn Anakin to the Dark Side and Rule as a Sith Triumvirate. Takes place right before Revenge of the Sith starts.,1594177575," 

The Clone Wars are nearing their end. Darth Sidious continues to lurk in the shadows, secretly conducting every aspect of this war. The “Chosen One” - Anakin Skywalker is growing more powerful by the second. Sidious senses this, along with Master Yoda and the other members of the Jedi Council. The Sith Apprentice - Darth Tyrannus, also known as Count Dooku, publicly leads the Separatist Movement. Tyrannus believes in his masters plan to bring about a new order to the galaxy in the form of a Galactic Empire. It is all a matter of time at this point, as everything that has transpired has done so according to the Dark Lords design. 

We start off with Dookus private shuttle on its way to Coruscant, soon landing in a secretive hangar deep in the city. A dark aura surrounds the area. As Dooku exits down the ramp of the shuttle, he is approached by a cloaked figure. The apprentice kneels before his Master. “We have much to discuss, Lord Tyrannus. Rise” Says Darth Sidious. The duo walks through the hangar and take a lift down to Sidious’s private quarters. Dooku says “Skywalker grows powerful, my lord. I can sense it”. Sidious responds “Yes... soon he will recognize his true potential. The Jedi are unwittingly causing Skywalker to turn to the dark side (Sidious pauses and grins) exponentially faster…”. Dooku asks “How exactly if I may ask?” Sidious snidely spits out “I would’ve expected you to understand… being a former Jedi. The council senses the boys potential and very much understands the path he is heading down. Their efforts to suppress his power will be their undoing, and when they realize what they have caused, it will be too late for them. There are a couple of points of attack we must take. We will threaten the ones he cares about and trusts… and he will use his anger to save them. Starting…. With the Chancellor…..” Dooku understands what his master is proposing. They will stage a capture of the Chancellor, and have the boy be the one to save him. “Will I be the one to capture the Chancellor?” Dooku asks. “NO” grunts Sidious. “You, the Sith apprentice, can not show your face on the homeworld of the Jedi and of the Republic. General Grievous will do it, and I am sure the Chancellor will be very cooperative…..” Sidious cackles loudly. “I see, my lord. You spoke of another point of attack, someone else he cares about. Skywalker and Senator Amidala have a connection that is easy to see. Are you suggesting she be killed? Like his mother….?” Sidious smirks and responds with “Your insights serve you well Tyrannus, but no. I have other plans for that aspect of the plan. The outright threat of assassination will not be sufficient in this case.” Dooku asks “What do you propose?” Sidious says “Leave it to me, this requires a power of the dark side you not yet even near being capable of.” Dooku nods and bows before his master once again, asking “what is thy bidding?” Sidious orders Dooku to return to his separatist fleet, and to rendezvous with General Grievous. Sidious gives the final word “It is time to capture Chancellor Palpatine”.",StarWars,iceghost34,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hn98yt/fan_fic_scene_of_sidious_and_dooku_discussing_a/

I remember watching ROTS for the first time when I was about eight or nine years old the year it came out. Of course I was enjoying the hell out of the action-packed fight between Anakin and Obi Wan like any other kid would. 

HOWEVER, when Obi Wan declares he has the high ground and tells Anakin “don’t try it”, I remember getting so excited because I thought Anakin was about to try shooting force lightning at him. Then Obi Wan would have blocked it with his lightsaber and Anakin, not realizing the kind of power he was trying to use, would end up frying himself ten times worse than Palpatine did with Windu, having their battle from earlier in the movie foreshadow this. And THAT was going to be the reason he became more machine than man as Darth Vader. 

But sadly that’s not what happened. I realize what actually happened was supposed to be Anakin using Obi Wan’s move he used to kill Darth Mail against him but I think what I just described would have been better for a couple reasons;

For one there was never a scene that showed Anakin learning about or acknowledging Obi Wan’s move from the end of TPM. He didn’t even know about it to our knowledge. We can only assume this was a conversation they had off-screen. (I honestly feel like there was a huge missed opportunity in the prequels not showing any scenes of Obi Wan training Anakin. I know there’s Clone Wars but that doesn’t excuse the movies lacking this IMO. Literally all of Anakin’s growth as a Jedi happens between movies). 

And for another I feel like having the fight end this way would serve as a nice metaphor for Anakin allowing his ambitions to destroy him. He mentions his “new powers” to Padme after he turns to the dark side but we never see him use any. He just swings his saber around like he was before he joined the dark side. 

I will admit I kind of grew out of liking the prequels and realize lots of you love them no matter how old you are. But still, I was only eight or nine when I had this thought about how the battle was about to end and still think it would have been cooler to see. Anakin getting crippled from trying to do a flip over Obi Wan seems like something that could have easily happened at any other point in the battle.",StarWars,theyvefoundusmarty,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hn6flp/what_i_remember_thinking_was_about_to_happen_at/

70,Why the sequels need and deserve their own TCW,1594166380,"**Synopsis**

*If you need a statement, not a manifesto* ;)

The sequels are a new canvas for storytellers to explore. The Mandalorian, Resistance, and existing books, comics, and games only barely scratched the surface. TCW greatly improved and developed the story of the prequels, drawing in many folks who didn't like or appreciate the prequels. If Lucasfilm created a TCW-like show for the sequels, it would be a brilliant, constructive way to address many criticism of the trilogy, bring in people who don't like them right now, while also providing something amazing for already existing sequel fans.

**Full essay**

I'll be frank, I'm a huge prequel fan. I unironically believe that prequels are masterpieces of storytelling and that Lucas told one of the greatest and most powerful stories of all time with them. I even like Jar Jar (don't kill me pls, also, the [guy is shady af](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUOwsRv6MLc&amp;feature=emb_title)). I also believe that the sequels are great movies. TFA was okay, but TLJ and TROS greatly increased my love of the sequel era, and I now consider TLJ and ROTS to be my favorite Star Wars movies, with TROS and TPM being close runner ups. This era is such an interesting and fascinating canvas for stories and it really needs its own TCW.

TCW didn't at all change my appraisal of the prequels. I loved them before TCW and I loved them after TCW, but TCW really did manage to get many people to warm up towards the prequels. This is because TCW was a very bold show which introduced new characters left and right while developing already existing characters massively, it introduced entire plot points integral to the story of the prequels, and didn't shy away from gently nudging the story of the prequels towards a more developed, complete form, all while exploring the galaxy and the setting in detail. It's a wonder!

One example of this gentle retconning is the Separatist Alliance. Lucas made a terrible mistake in removing certain key scenes from AOTC, which ended up greatly compromising this great movie. Dooku's motives aren't at all clear, and the movie seems to imply that the Separatists are composed of corporations like the Trade Federation. This is not at all what was going on. The Separatists were de jure a federal republic, just like the Galactic Republic, and they had their own government on Raxus, as well as an elected Parliament. The Trade Federation and the megacorporations, while cooperating with the Separatists in secret, never actually picked a side, as they retained their seats in the Galactic Senate. They were actually positioning themselves to come out on top regardless who wins. Of course this failed as the Empire simply nationalized or destroyed any corporations which were disloyal to the new regime, but I slightly digress... Lucas and the creators of TCW corrected the mistakes made in AOTC.

What I want to illustrate with the example above is that TCW was able to essentially develop the story of the prequels into a more interesting, cohesive, and engaging form. I would argue that the sequel era has the same kind of potential and that it deserves its own TCW. It might appear at first glance that this era doesn't have the same kind of potential for expansion as the prequel era did, but I think the potential is absolutely there. Especially in light of the revelation that Palpatine and the Sith Eternal have been pulling the strings secretly for decades. There are so many things a TCW-like sequel show could explore. But we need to think big. Really BIG. TCW takes place solely between AOTC and ROTS until the Siege of Mandalore finale, which takes place in parallel with ROTS. This conception should be expanded and refined.

A sequel TCW should span the entire length of the sequel era starting from a couple of years after The Mandalorian (9 ABY, so maybe 15 ABY). The bulk of the show should take place before TFA. I would imagine this period could be around five seasons. And then, since TFA and TLJ take place immediately after each other, the show could run in parallel with these movies a la Siege of Mandalore and provide entirely new perspectives and story elements, enriching the movies. The following topics could be explored in detail:

* Early days of the New Republic and Leia's political career

* Luke's searches for Ahch-To, Exegol, and ancient wisdom

* Luke's Temple and his students

* Rey's parents and their escape from Sith Eternal

* Ben and Rey's childhoods

* Rise of the First Order

* Palpatine's machinations from Exegol

* Ben Solo's betrayal of the Jedi and the death of the new Order

* Birth of Kylo Ren and how he became the master of the Knights of Ren

* Impact of Ben's betrayal on Luke, Han, Leia, and Chewie

* Final days of the New Republic and the conflict between Centrist and Populists

As many of these are partially or fully covered by books, comics, and games, the show should just integrate those storylines in its own narrative. Then the show could take time with another season or two to neatly fill out the gap between TLJ and TROS with all sorts of adventures. There was a whole galactic war with the First Order here. We could see just how Luke's sacrifice on Crait inspired the galaxy, rebuilding of the Resistance, some more politics, and such. And finally, the show would conclude by running in parallel with TROS. We could see and hear the horror of Palpatine's broadcast across the stars, the initial shock and fear, how Lando gathered the fleet, and ultimately, the Battle of Exegol itself with much more detail and from the perspective of the combatants. In the end, there ought to be hopeful little epilogue taking place a number of years later as the New Jedi Order is now flourishing and the New Republic is stronger than ever. Rey and Finn are rebuilding the Jedi together, Poe is now the leader of the New Republic, Rose is a captain or an admiral in the Republic Navy, you get the picture. Oh, and it turns out that redeemed Ben Solo is now a permanent ghost companion to Rey, as the dyad in the Force allows him to guide and advise her, and the Jedi. 

This kind of a show would be absolutely brilliant, and a constructive way for Lucasfilm to address many criticisms of the sequels, warm up and satisfy many people who might not like them right now, and provide something really beautiful for us sequel fans too.

#8: attack of the clones: worst love story in the saga, the only redeemable quality is the battle at the end.

#7: phantom menace: has some good moments. jar-jar is awful however. maul v obi wan and qui gon is one of the best star wars fights of all time.

#6: the last jedi: i used to rank way lower but adam driver is the ewan mcgregor of his trilogy and makes this film more enjoyable to watch than the ones before. they ruined luke which is why this is still low.

#5: the force awakens: i was hype to see it when it first came out, it’s definitely better than the movies before it but it’s nothing special, just a new hope remastered honestly.

#4: revenge of the sith: i grew up with this movie and have a soft spot for it. the fights are excellently choreographed, get to see the fall of the republic and rise of the empire, and palpatine is excellent as always in the prequels.

#3: a new hope: although the fight scene wasn’t very good, the prequels give it a lot of emotion. it was the beginning, and you have to give respect for that, however it is a pretty basic story compared to other movies, which is fine because it was the first. also pro tip, watch sc 38 reimagined on youtube instead of the actual duel scene. it’s basically a lot faster and connects better to the prequels. it’s also super intense and really shows how powerful vader was.

#2: return of the jedi: in my opinion the true ending to the skywalker saga, it’s an absolute classic that’s amazing to watch from beginning to end. the only problem i have is it drags a bit when they get to endor at first.

#1: Empire strikes back: the ultimate star wars movie, everything about this movie is amazing. i have no complaints.",StarWars,c_carey22,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hn4k0n/rating_the_skywalker_saga_from_worst_to_best/

96,Doom of Master Yoda,1594160464,"First and foremost... All Hail the Sith. 
That said I want to prong up something that me and another person were discussing. 

The Dark side is strongest when there are less practitioners while the light side relies on numbers and unity. We shall Call this ""The Balance"" Thanks to Darth Bane the ""Rule of two"" was established within the Dark side to strengthen the order. Clearly seen by Lord Sidious and Vader our prime examples.

Now I think we can all agree that Master Yoda has Earned Respect, and to think otherwise brings disrespect and shame to any of us... But I now realize that Master Yoda could not have won Vs Darth Sidious. See where I'm going with this?!

With all the Greatness we know of pertaining to Master Yoda. He lost the fight well before the confrontation. You see Lord Sidious was at his prime. One could say at that moment he had no more advantages to one up on Master Yoda... But he needed no more. 

You see while the Sith were two they were supreme in their power placement... As was Master Yoda... But the moment ""Order 66"" was initiated the light side as a whole, ""The Balance"" was broken. Master Yoda Champion of the Light, Lost his power that moment on Kashyyyk. 

That Final fight was Master Yoda's last chance. And even then it was Lost Before he arrived.

I in all my Dark side fanaticism, couldn't comprehend why Yoda Lost... Now may it be clear for the Holocrons and the archives.

64,Go to StarWars: Reverse to understand,1594146560,"The younglings were asleep on their way to Kamino. The ship was dimly lit and R2 was the pilot. They were going to receive training on war protocol and how to successfully communicate with the clones during specific battle scenarios. 

At their pleasent arrival, Obi Wan directed them to where they would be training. Luke and Leia were calm about everything, and so were most of the class. Luke was trying to guess what the protocols were so that he could seem smart. Leia was just wondering if a clone could help her prank Obi Wan.

They were walking through the smooth white hallways with the drumming of the rain on top of them until they reached their spot. It was very open and welcoming. But at one moment, Leia realized she had forgotten her lightsaber on the ship. 

""Welcome, children. I am Captain Rex, call me sir. I see you have all come to learn about strategy and teamwork."" Leia couldn't interrupt, so she waited for the right time to silently leave. Obi Wan was gone somewhere to inform the Jedi council that they had arrived safely. 

Leia was stealthily navigating her way to the ship, until she encountered 3 clones. She got scared, and started to run. The clones got suspicious, and started to go after her. She escaped through the vents and spied on the troopers. ""She may have overheard our plans. If we don't capture her, we will be executed for treason!"" Leia realized she had caught rogue clones who were planning something against the Republic. 

She needed to get back to class soon, otherwise she might be in big trouble. She decided she needed to go to class and inform the teacher. But she aslo thought that maybe she could deal with the troops herself. She dropped down in front of the clones, but they didn't shoot. They could only capture her since any kind of blast could alarm other clones. 

She ran around the halls and dodged their attempts at sustaining her, while giving them a big bonk on the head. One clone pushed her to another and he caught her. She was now on the he hands of rogue clones. She couldn't scream for help because the clones could just lie, and their armor was to strong to bite through. She was really in a mess. She kicked the clone's stomach and started to run as fast as she could. She reached a wide open hangar and hid behind a bunch of crates. They reached the doors but Leia used the force to lock them. ""Open the door You sneaky brat!"" loudly whispered one of the clones. 

Leia found a hologram device and knew exactly what to do. She recorded the words of the clones while searching for ways to keep them out of the hangar. She realized near her area is where the ship was. She ran away from the door and headed to the ship. The ship was closed and she couldn't open it. She decided to leave the ship and find Obi Wan.

Trooper 2 ""Blow up the door! I know we need the bombs but that child could ruin the whole operation!"" Trooper 1 ""You know well we need every single one of those bombs. Plus, they'll figure out what were doing with all the noise!"" Trooper 2 ""What if we can blame it on her?"" Trooper 1""Not if she can snitch on us first"" Trooper 2""Then use the bombs!"" Trooper 3 ""I don't here her anymore, she might have left"" Trooper 2""This is all your fault! Now were definitely going to be executed"" Trooper 3""This isn't worth it, we don't need to risk our lives for some mistakes the Republic made. Let's  just get over it"" Trooper 2 ""Fine, leave us and go back to your hypocrite and corrupt Republic, just know you won't have much time left to live. You know too much"" Trooper 3 ""Fine, wait we forgot about the kid!""

Leia was nearing Obi Wan until she encountered Captain Rex. ""I've been looking for you all over the place! What are you up too missy?"" Leia told Captain Rex everything, including the lightsaber part. Rex informed Obi Wan and the younglings were sent to the ship. ""Leia! Where have you been? You should've seen what Rex showed us, I can't believe you missed it."" ""Not now Luke, there are three rogue clones who want to commit treason against the Republic."" ""So that's what you've been doing.""

Obi Wan met with Leia and she showed him the footage. ""We don't have much time. Inform the council and tell everyone look out for three suspicious clones."" Leia saw the troops hurrying left to right in organized formations. She was interested about what the clones were gonna do about the situation.

The clones had been caught putting up bombs all over the base. They were sent to Corouscant and were executed for treason. Leia and the others arrived safely to the Jedi temple and she was proud that she had serve the Republic.

She felt bad for causing the execution of the clones and ending the lives of who could've been redeemed. She had this anxiety for days. She would never forget the day she caught 3 rogue clones on Kamino.",StarWars,bobafett5555,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hn04sn/go_to_starwars_reverse_to_understand/

22,"[Spoilers for TFA, RoS, TLJ] Behold! The Holdo Torpedo! (Long post because nerdery, TLDR at the end.)",1594134348,"Inspired by the Holdo manouver's scene, I thought up a superweapon that can be mass produced! **TL;DR at the end.**

**First, some calculations:**

So, a basic TIE/In fighter costs 60 000 credits, and a T65 X-wing costs 150 000 credits. The X-wing has 2 more engines, a shield generator, 2 more laser canons, 2 proton torpedo launchers, and, what is important for our purposes, a class 1 hyperdrive. If we assume the costs of the basic chassis of the two crafts are roughly equal, the extra equipment on the X-wing costs 90 000 credits. Five ""groups"" of item, coming out to an 18 000 credit average cost per group, but let's assume hyper drives are the most expensive, let's make their cost 36 000 credits. that means the 2 extra engines come out to 13 500 credits. 

An R2 unit costs 4525 credits, and astromechs are shown to be able to pilot a basic craft on its own (like when Obi Wan's fighter is flown away by his astromech droid, while he stays on Utapau.)

For the sake of simplicity, and the lack of sources, let's say a tie fighter hull's worth of durasteel costs around 12500 credits. (A modern aircraft's manufacturing materials make up only 25% of the costs, to my surprise, I have gone with that.)

This means, manufacturing a hyperspace capable, 2 engine, self piloted durasteel torpedo with a length of ten meters is Roughly 70 000 credits to manufacture, if we assume the sensors to guide the torpedo and the manufacturing cost of the hull is 14 000 credits over all. 

This is however, Only if we want one with a long term use, durable hyperdrive. Thing is...  Torpedoes are anything but long term use. The only thing this Tropedo needs from its hyper drive, is at worst a 1 minute reliable function time. For one, you don't want Holdo torpedoes that miss, to be travelling for who knows how long, and it's not like any investment in t the hyperdrive's functioning beyond the time it hits its target, is waster money, so let's hald the cost of it to 18 000 credits, bringing the over all cost of the Holdo torpedo down to 36025 credits. 

For little more than half the cost of a TIE figther, you can create an undodgable torpedo that is too fast to intercept, and as Han Solo's infiltration of Starkiller base shown, can skip through shields, without concern for precision even, and if brought close enough in the safety of a gunship, can be targeted with high precision.

**TL;DR as promised**: if you have 36025 credits on your hands, you can manufacture a toropedo capable of replicating the holdo manouver against capital ships.",StarWars,Doveen,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hmw86d/spoilers_for_tfa_ros_tlj_behold_the_holdo_torpedo/

Obviously, the 'hard-core' Star Wars fan base are less than impressed with the recent installments to the franchise, and as someone who enjoys star wars but isn't massively knowledgeable about the Canon lore etc, I can totally see why. 

I'm currently half way through 'Rise of Skywalker', and I cannot believe what I'm seeing... it borders on ridiculous. 

The constant attempts at 'humor'... the completely unbelievable 'coincidences' ... the predictability... 

I almost feel like I've seen it before because I have had 100% accuracy in predicting what's going to happen next.

And the fact that they just tack on new characters on a whim, to fill plot holes and give the main protagonists a free pass on literally everything... It's so easy to see why big fans of the franchise are so disheartened.

Now the guy is respectful and I won’t get into his video as this is more about the idea that the franchise is somehow worse off now then ever. I find this a ridiculous statement.

Firstly, the obvious fact that there is a lot of new cinematic, television and video game content coming so in a literal sense the series is far from dead. 

Culturally Star Wars is as relevant as ever, if not more due to the discussion of the ST and the massive amount of new fans introduced by The Mandalorian. So again far from dead.

and could you imagine how boring it would be if it was? if the force was all there ever was and we would never see anything new from it? that would be so bland, i personally loved all the new force powers introduced in the PT and ST and don't see any one as an issue cause the force works in mysterious ways and there is no cap or limitation on it, so stuff like force projection, dyads, force healing and force screaming/sprinting doesn't bother me too much and in a show centred around these things i think its silly to use them to criticise them when there's nothing definite about it

If jedi could just Force heal for no reason then Anakin wouldn't have turned to the dark side and could have just forced healed Padme instead. Same goes with Obi Wan with Satine and Qui Gon it just dont make sense at all. Also Palpatine coming back really ruins Darth Vaders sacrifice. If you think TLJ is bad then it's not mostly its fault I really wish the New Republic would not have fallen so easily and we could have seen a even war that could easily set up a show like the Clone Wars show. I really wished they kept Mara Jade canon too. Which brings me to my next point in the Force Awakens they set up all these mysteries that were actually really fun to think about (remember Reys Parents and Snoke Theories) but the last too movies really ruined it by making Snoke a Clone and making Palpatine Reys grandad. I really wished Rey was an actual Skywalker because it wouldn't have made people so mad when she said it at the end and it could have possibly made Mara Jade canon. Another thing that is wrong with them is that Rey beat Kylo Ren. I mean sure Kylo was hurt but all rey was doing is swinging a lightsaber in anger while Kylo was timing his attacks but he still lost which to me that means Luke is a bad teacher. Also how did Rey use the force when she just found out what it was not to earlier in the movie? And how did she even know what a mind trick was? Anyway there were some parts I liked, like Poe and BB-8 and Finn right up until Rose Tico saved him ( I thought he should have died a hero) and How they made Revan canon. But I liked the idea of Luke failing I just wished they would have did it anyway differently than him going to kill Ben just because he had Dark Side tendencies. But my favorite part of the whole Sequel trilogy was when they payed respects to Anakin by makeing all the ships come in ROTS because if you can Remember Anakin said ""the worst thing about this universe is no one helps each other out"" and I really liked that. Sure Rey is a Mary Sue and a not great character but she is the idol of so many little girls that will make fine additions to the star wars community. And if those silly rumors are actually true (which I know they aren't going to be dont hate me) then it wouldn't erase the sequels completely but it would have two timelines which could be something good for the people who dont like the sequels so much but it also could be bad. Whatever happens I know that Jon Favreau and Dave Filoni know what there doing and hopefully one of them will be the new head of star wars when Kathleen Kennedy is gone.

84,New Animated Star Wars TV Shows,1594078029,"(Ideas)

I'm not here to argue the state of the Star Wars franchise, either in favor of, or against (honestly i couldn't care less either way at this point in picking a side), i see valid points on either side of the fandom, and also some bogus accusations from both sides. But who cares anymore, you like what you like and you dislike what you dislike. Collectively though we faced these same circumstances 15 years ago with the close of the prequels, although back then the more prevailing vocal opinion was against them. But you know what they say, when life gives you lemons, make lemonade, and one of the sweetest lemonades that the prequels gave us was The Clone Wars. This saved the prequels era and helped many better understand George's vision for that trilogy of films, retroactively improving the way many view those films. It fleshed out the period, world building, movie reference expanding (Sifo Dyas, Angels on the Moons of Iego, Gundarks, Order 66, Clone Lives etc), building the relationships of the existing roster of characters, as well as bringing in many new fan favorites (Cad Bane, Embo, Hondo, Savage Oppress, Pre-Vizla, Satine, Bo Katan, Rex and of course, Ahsoka).

Something i have noticed sorely lacking for the Sequel Trilogy is this insane level of world-building that the Prequel Trilogy had. While the animated show ""Resistance"" did add a lot in terms of your regular folk in the galaxy, it was sorely lacking when it came to strange new alien worlds, and new characters from every corner of the galaxy, instead focusing on three groups (Residents of the Colossus, a small band of Pirates, and a few members of the First Order) in a handful of locations. I have also noticed a level of timidness to do anything with the Original Trilogy era using it's characters. Almost like they are seen as too holy to develop with any major significance, relegating them cameos and side character roles in the newer films and televised media (With the exception of Solo, but even that was a prequel). How is it fair that Anakin, Obi-Wan and Padme get 3 movies and 7 seasons to develop, and yet our original trio has only their original movies and a handful of cameos in Star Wars Rebels? Yes, they've had a very decent amount of fleshing out in the Marvel comics line, but the more casual fan will seldom venture into this media. With this point also in mind, it's unlikely that the casual fan has read the great Clone Wars legacy content such as Dark Disciple and Son of Dathomir. In the casual viewers minds, there is still the loose ends of ""What happened to Asajj Ventress? how did Darth Maul escape the clutches of Darth Sideous? What happened to Cad Bane and the bounty hunters?"" I am incredibly grateful for season 7, and if that truly is the final piece of true clone wars media, fair enough. But i can't help but feel that until you see something realized on screen, it's not quite real to the casual viewer. 

like it or not, the sequels are here to stay, so with the ""Lemons"" we have (and whether you like lemons or not is not the topic of discussion here), what lemonade can we make?  


**Star Wars: Rebellion**

a sort of soft sequel to Rebels (I'm sure a true sequel is well under-way), but where that show focused on a single rebel cell and it's gradual integration into the larger rebellion during the build up to the Galactic Civil War, this show would focus on the actual five year Civil War that began with the Battle of Scariff, as seen in Rogue One. This show would focus on the larger rebellion as a whole, It could cover stories with known characters like:

* Han, Luke, Leia, Chewie, Lando, R2, 3-P0
* Wedge Antilles, Hobbie
* Kes Dameron
* Shara Bey
* Hera Syndulla and the Ghost Crew, (including occasionally) Sabine
* Cham Syndulla
* Mon Mothma, Dodonna, Admiral Ackbar
* Captain Rex, Ahsoka Tano (what was she doing between Malachor and Rebels Epilogue?)
* Willrow Hood, Prune Face (why not)
* The bounty hunters and the criminal underworld before Jabba's demise four years into the war,
* Hondo 
* Mandalore under Bo Katan fighting the Empire 

which would allow us to see how the Movie characters and Animated characters interacted during this period and bring in a whole host of new characters, much like clone wars did. Given that this era was covered in the Marvel Comics, a length of about Four or Five seasons would be adequate, 1 Season per year, with room for the stories to co-exist. Who wouldn't want to see Ahsoka interacting with Luke, or Hera's rivalry with Han Solo? a reunion between Rex and Cody, Hondo ""Negotiating"" with Mon Mothma or Luke learning about his father from Rex? They could bring in a new cast of characters via a Rebel Cell, greatly fleshing out this era and this war. This would be ""The Clone Wars"" for the Original Trilogy era. Although it has to format itself differently enough for it not to just be a carbon copy of Clone Wars, and there should be a clear cut narrative purpose from Start to Finish (Like with Justice League Unlimited, a show that balanced a giant cast with a great through story that coincidentally also involved a space station with a giant super-weapon). This would need to introduce several new villains. Gar Saxon held the title of ""Emperor's Hand"", his death would be the perfect time to introduce Mara Jade. Mark Hamill can return to voice Luke (with perhaps some voice modulation to make him sound younger), Billy Dee Williams as Lando and Julie Dolan as Leia.

**Star Wars: Tales From The Clone Wars:**

Given the major success of Season 7, is it any wonder that fans wish for more? The final arc especially had the best formatting of any of the stories from the entire show, with it being possible to watch the final 4 episodes seamlessly as a movie. This is the format this series of releases can adopt. Adapting the final 11 unfinished Stories into eleven animated movies (the 4 ""Episodes"" of each arc all presented in a single run like the 2008 Clone Wars Movie, but to the quality of The Siege of Mandalore) set between the Clone Wars season 6 and 7. Having them air as actual movies would necessitate that each story would have to be written to flow like a movie (unlike the original movie, which was clearly 4 single episodes loosely stitched together). The final arcs this would cover include:

* The Bounty Hunters Arc
* Crystal Crisis On Utapau
* Lethal Alliance (*Dark Disciple* Chapter 1-21)
* Bad Batch on Kashyyyk
* Son of Dathomir
* Ahsoka's Return to the Jedi Temple
* Dark Disciple (Chapters 22-42)
* Top Gun with Clones
* Yuzhan Vong X-Files Arc
* Return to Mon Cala
* Bounty Hunter Seeking Ahsoka as a Youngling Flashback

Obviously, many of these tales would require some overhauls given some newer stories told/ being told since they were first envisioned. The Yuhzhan Vong scout ship arc would instead focus on their canon equivalent, The Grysk's (providing it wouldn't contradict Thrawn Alliances), Ahsoka's return to the temple can omit Anakin from the story, and provide a solid basis for the line in Rebels; *""\[Yoda\] carried a great burden, a deep sorrow, as if he knew before anyone else, that one time was ending, and another beginning""*, something Yoda didn't realise until after his season 6 arc, after Ahsoka had left, and something Ahsoka wouldn't be able to feel from their brief encounter during the siege of Mandalore. So she must have seen him in between. In Return to Mon Cala, Norrir Ri would no longer end up being the one murdered during the arc. These ""Movies"" could be released alongside the other shows, with two stories being released during the first year, and 3 stories per year after that. They could also weave the story of Clone Trooper Kix being abducted by the separatists and placed into stasis somewhere in there if they wanted to, setting a few stories after ""The Bad Batch"".

&amp;#x200B;

**Star Wars: Resistance War**

This story would massively flesh out the sequel trilogy era. The War takes place over a year between TLJ and TROS, so they could have every season covering 3 months of the conflict. Four Seasons. This could borrow a page from ""Young Justice"" show, with Location, Months and Days being included in many establishing shots to show the exact progression of time during the conflict. Multiple simultaneous stories being developed over several episodes. During season 3 or 4, characters from Star Wars Resistance (The Colossus) can begin showing up. The small size of the Resistance lends itself to a show rooted in Gorilla Warfare, this would take the premise of the ""Onderon Arc"" of The Clone Wars and push it to its full potential. 

 Rey was ""always training"" by the time of The Rise of Skywalker, so she would have to be used carefully during this show. There should definitely be a story which see's the characters return to Mortis, explaining the nature of Rey's role in light of Anakin's role as the chosen one. There should be more seeds of the Grysks planted especially during this show; nothing too ""in your face"", but just enough to sow the seeds for the future. With the comics and books showing the Resistance on the run from the first order, heading from planet to planet before settling on Ajan Kloss, the first three seasons or so can really explore the galaxy, introducing exciting new planets in every story (not your standard ""Forest/ Desert/ Water/ Snow"" planets either, i'm talking creative like Felucia, or the glass cities of  [Tah'Nuhna](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tah%27Nuhna), this is the time to really start showing us new planets with new and exciting architecture and unconventional plant-life and animal life. Animation is the perfect medium for this. Here is where we can get to know the galaxy at large and introduce a vast array of new characters and aliens that intersect the story of the Resistance. Also this show is where this conflict between the F.O and Resistance would finally get a name. Characters introduced in this show could also get their own live action spin-offs if done correctly; A Live Action Firefly style show starring [Sidon Ithano](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sidon_Ithano) and his pirate crew (which includes the Clone Trooper Kix) immediately comes to mind as something that would be awesome. Finn can be utilized properly and Poe can spend the first season reflecting/ blaming himself for the deaths of 370 members of the 400 strong Resistance, gradually coming to terms with it. The final moments of the fourth season would see the Resistance, and also the galaxy at large (including a reaction montage of all previous places they have visited during the show) receiving the Mysterious Broadcast leading into Episode IX. Like seriously i DO NOT want to have to keep listening to a [Fortnite clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAL2rTH7SAE) for such an important bit of lore. Put it in a show.

Given that John Boyega and Daisy Ridley lent their voices to Star Wars Forces of Destiny, and Oscar Isaac to Star Wars Resistance (and given the smaller time commitment necessary from voice acting), they could reprise their roles here.  **Carolyn Hennesy** can return to voice Leia as she did for Resistance, and then the character can get a proper narrative send-off leading up to her limited role in The Rise of Skywalker. It was great that they found a way to include Carrie in that film in whatever way they could, but tragically it was always going to be limited. There are no restraints with Animation, and while nobody can every truly replace our princess, Carolyn did a stellar job, good enough to provide a fitting end for the Character.

New First Order villains, new bounty hunters, New Crime Lords, New Resistance characters (more Aliens, i'm sick of these all human characters and the re-use of Chewie). Returning Characters should include Zay Versio and Shriv, as well as Black Squadron. 

**Major Lemon:** The Overuse of Super-Weapons

We have seen super weapons be a focus of Rogue One, A New Hope, Return of the Jedi, The Force Awakens and The Rise of Skywalker (with some scaled back death star tech in The Last Jedi too). This needs addressing. Why did the Emperor have not one, not two, but an entire fleet of Super Weapons produced?!? Why re-visit this idea again and again.  it's often said that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result. Was the Emperor just insane? or did he have a purpose beyond control through fear. 

**Major Lemonade:** It was a defense Fleet for an impending Invasion

Perhaps as a young man, Sheev 'Frank' 'To be the Senate' Palpatine saw the stagnant nature of the politics of the republic, all of the red tape and endless debating and realized that if an external invasion should occur, the galaxy would be massively under-prepared to defend itself. If he were to have knowledge of the Grysks (canon equivalent of the Vong), then he may have had the Death Stars, and the ""Death Fleet"" at Exegol built primarily to defend against this coming attack. This could cast doubt on the evil nature of Palpatine. Protection through order, Defense by Power. Like Thanos, he believes in doing a wrong thing for a noble cause. Sacrificing freedom and potentially 1% of life in the galaxy firmly establishing his empire to save 99% of it. But the sequel trilogy 1) Decimated the entire Republic, not just through dissolution of the Senate, but through the death and destruction of all the Senators, the Capitol and the entire military in one swift stroke. 2) The ""System Killer"", Starkiller Base was destroyed; a long range Hyperspace Beam capable of destroying multiple targets at the other side of the galaxy. 3) The military might of the First Order and then the Sith Fleet (all equipped with Super Weapons) was completely wiped out. While these were all great victories in the eyes of the general public, the galaxy as we leave it in Episode IX has never been in a weaker state than it has right now. They have no leadership, they have no military, they have no defense. The time for their invasion is now. The Grysks are coming, and the galaxy won't stand a chance. 

**There you have it folks.** 

Three Shows putting you in the thick of the three major ""**Wars**"" in Star Wars. Four Seasons of Rebellion, Four Seasons of Resistance War, and Eleven ""Tales From The Clone Wars"" released over four years. Rebellion and Resistance War would each need a unique new art style. Each series completing and strengthening the three eras of the films. For each era, something for every fan to be happy about. Each pointing toward things yet to come. And who knows, they could improve each era in the same way that Clone Wars improved the Prequels. While all of this would never happen, [i can dream harold!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJOfJQDMX4)

It's time to stop this endless bickering, accept what is, make some lemonade and #UniteTheFandom

85,Did Ben Solo complete or comply with idea of the Eight Virtues of Bushido that comprise the Samurai Code of Honor when he sacrificed himself for Rey?,1594077978,"Being that it looks like he immediately made the the choice to give up his life force to save Rey, it looks like he fulfilled each of the virtues in that moment. They look to be self explanatory as related to the act (except maybe Justice, meaning she did it to save him first before so he responded in kind).

Rectitude or Justice.

Courage.

Benevolence or Mercy.

Politeness.

Honesty and Sincerity.

Honor.

Loyalty.

Character and Self-Control.

It seems very interesting as this could be considered as part of the phenomenon of the cross-cultural exchange between the entertainment / popular cultures of The United States and Japan. Some other examples I've heard of are of how the cartoon ""Steamboat Mickey"" shown in Japan was the the core source or beginning inspiration of anime. The use of characters with large eyes began there. Or of how the film Bade Runner was a huge influence on anime at the time (Spoilers: see the original Bubblegum Crisis series). Lastly, of course, is the huge influence of Japanese Samurai films on George Lucas in creating Star Wars. This ""back and forth"" exchange is has always been a fascinating concept for me.

Rey's Wookie's page even says that she was born in 15 ABY ""in hopes of keeping her safe from the Emperor"". But he was dead already?

Taika waititi on Star Wars is extremely exciting.

But with Star Wars he doesn’t have to be confined to a temple like marvel with Star Wars it’s a lot less restricted a person can do whatever creatively with its own sets of characters and worlds not having to confine to a template like marvel so it’d be more like his indie films",StarWars,Skankhunt2099,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hmhnh7/taika_waititi_on_star_wars_is_exciting/

28,The Clone Wars: Essential watching order,1594071761,"Hello there!

I recently finished TCW and I wanted my friends to watch the series as well so they wouldn't miss this masterpiece. As you may know, many episodes/arcs are damn boring and sometimes you just want to skip them and watch what makes this series so good. That gave me an idea and I created a new watching order that I would recommend to those who don't want to watch all 133 episodes but still want to see what makes this series so good.

\-The first number is the episode number

\-The second number is the episode number according to the official chronological order

\-The third number is the episode air number(ex. 312 is season 3 episode 12)

\-The title of the episode

\-The \[S\] tag for an episode means that that episode can be skipped if you want, while the \[MW\] tag stands for an episode that is a Must-Watch

\-The text marked as spoiler is the reason why I put the episode in the list

72,Specialization of Imperial military,1594063369,"Empire under Palpatine had a vast number of stormtroopers, however along with stormtroopers there were army corps.
Stormtroopers seem to be stationed only on ships, not on planets directly. Regular army corps would be basic garrison units i think.

A stormtrooper is a core of all specialized troops.
Stormtrooper's station is on a ship, and his role is to guard the ship or deploy as part of an invasion force on planets, other ships. He may also be deployed to a planet as a recon unit or similar, however there are specially trained stormtroopers for that role, a basic stormtrooper could be stationed on a planet as a temporary garrison or patrol, but he would still belong to the ship that deployed him down there, and if a ship had to relocate somewhere else in a galaxy, stormtrooper would return to the ship.

That is for a basic stormtrooper.
Empire also trains further some stormtroopers to specialize in certain areas, and they become stormtrooper variants.
Some of the known variants are :
-Shock troopers (specialize in shock tactics, assault)
-Scout troopers (specialize in scouting,recon)
-Arctic troopers (specialize in combat in snow and cold terrains)
-Aquatic troopers (specialize in underwater combat)
-Desert troopers (specialize in desert fighting)

And so on and so on, there are perhaps more than 100 variants that Empire has in its possession.

I dont know under what circumstances are specialised troopers deployed, as in films we see regular stormtroopers in deserts, which would probably suit desert troopers better.

For special forces, empire uses death troopers, shadow troopers, commandos.",StarWars,DavDav98,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hmeiva/specialization_of_imperial_military/

87,What happened to the original clone troopers when they became biologically too old to fight in the Empire?,1594044302,"The first clones were created in 33 BBY. After the fall of the Republic and the founding of the Galactic Empire by the Emperor, the Clone army was folded in the Imperial Army. At some point during the Galactic Civil War, the Empire stopped new clone production and began recruiting normal humans to fill the ranks. The 501st legion was the only combat unit of the Imperial Army left that was fully made up of clones.

But these clones age twice as fast as normal humans. At the time of the Battle of Yavin, a clone created during the Clone Wars would thus be in his 60s, biologically speaking. The story of Rex aside, we can't assume that all clones would be in their prime fighting shape. Most clones wouldn't have survived this long because of all the wars, but it's fair to assume that some did and remained loyal to the Empire.

So what did the Empire do? Did it send them on the battlefields of the galaxy, alongside troopers half their biological age? Did it promote them to senior command positions? Did it offer them a retirement? Did it throw them out on the streets? Or something else?",StarWars,RoutineProcedure,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hm88jj/what_happened_to_the_original_clone_troopers_when/

33,Resistance Era Galaxy Map?,1594029299,"Just a quick question about the sequel trilogy. Disney may very well have not put any thought into this, or kept it vague, but is there a map or any references to where the Imperial remnant (not the first order) territory was in this point or around the aftermath books?  


The issue is there is reference to the inner core, but It's not specific if they were kicked out of the galactic ""north"" and ""south""  So given just the info we have would it be reasonable to assume they're only in the western galactic core? Given that the first order invaded primarily from the north west and swept south east in the films, and given that Luke is positioned on Ach-to in the galactic south-west and if the Empire remnant was in that area would we expect Luke or any of the heroes of the sequel trilogy to fly through their territory to the temple?  


The canon wiki clearly states in the Galactic concordance entry that the imperial remnants did not cease to be due to the treaty. And in places seems very clear that the first order is AN imperial remnant, not THE imperial remnants. Implying that it was one, albeit the strongest, of several.

55,Pitch for a point of divergence fanfiction- Yoda wins his duel with Sidious,1594019544,"**Point of divergence:** Yoda wins the duel with Darth Sidious, killing him. Yoda dies shortly thereafter of his wounds.

**The Jedi:** Almost all of the Jedi are dead due to order 66, and the bare handful remaining face the task of reconstructing the order.  Obi-Wan Kenobi is the most senior surviving member of the Jedi council and faces the unenviable task of trying to recreate the order safely yet expediently. With the peace as fragile as it is there is pressure on the Jedi to accelerate the regrowth of their order by taking shortcuts in training- a pressure that must be weighed against millennia of tradition- and the dangerous lure, the dark side can have upon the young. Old debates about whether the Jedi code is too restrictive- or not restrictive enough- threaten to break the order.

**The clones:** The death of Sidious and the political chaos that followed it severed the remaining clones from effective control- while the are not evil, they are both unemployed and heavily armed, making peace fragile. 

**A ravaged galaxy:** The galaxy is devastated by the war and many old grievances that were temporarily submerged by the fighting have returned. The overall sense is of a ""wild-west"" galaxy without clear lines of authority. The Republic survives but is widely seen as discredited. The smart money says civil war is inevitable, with only a handful of devoted Jedi and diplomats working to prevent it.

**Anakin and the Sith:** Anakin is alive, though badly injured, and wishes to finish the massacre he began. Although immensely strong in the force, he is destined to be manipulated by those with more political acumen than himself. While there are only ever two Sith, Palpatine had cultivated numerous dark side users as assassins, spies and even potential apprentices. Many of these now via for the mantle of the Sith.

**Theme: The force as a mystery:** Both the Jedi and Sith had imagined very different futures- the Jedi through the fulfilment of the prophecy, the Sith through the completion of their conspiracy. Yet almost all the Jedi died suddenly, and the Sith are now leaderless.

8,[spoilers] Regarding this franchise reboot rumors,1593998794,"I personally hope these rumors are a bunch of poppycock and they arent doing it. I dont necessarily mind a multiverse of star wars I guess cause it already exists, its just this whole idea of sweeping those last 3 films under the rug to do something else instead bothers me. The only thing it would do right is properly respect the chosen one lore and be done with it after return of the jedi, not flip flop and say oh no its rey who is going to do it! Thats all I'd respect. But I actually enjoyed alot of aspects of 7, 8 and 9, just cause the films didnt make the money disney wanted, apparently those films have to go. Not that they care about my opinion but maybe idk the fact SW didnt do well mostly is cause it shouldnt have existed after return of the jedi. Im not against the idea of a sequel to rotj but the idea it should continue force war just to captalize on nostalgia imo was the wrong way to go, to kill the lore just to sell tickets, its a smart business move I suppose but in terms of the story it tarnished it. Thats something I keep trying to tell these people who say last jedi killed star wars, im saying no it died the second they made the script.

If they do this, even if its an alternate universe, it still has to explain then the chosen one thing I guess never existed in that world which tbh Im glad upon cause the chosen one is an overplayed trope that lucas didnt bring in till the prequels, plus this seer who foretold only saw so far, they just saw the defeat of the empire and assumed that was the end.

In other scenes like the Battle of Endor, there is no reason for them to miss. Yet, in the intro in A New Hope, they wiped out all rebels inside the ship, with minimal casualties at best.

Is there some sort of reason why for some reason, at some times, they miss their targets for some reason? and why they don't? Is it their blaster that they're using? The helmet they are using?

35,How to fix TROS without deleting the whole movie,1593986812,"First lets start with the Star Destroyers. Xyston Class Star Destroyers are basically just larger Imperial I Star Destroyers but with a gun on the bottom. I'd just say they're modified Imperial I Star Destroyers. I'd also replace the planet killing superlasers with siege cannons like on the First Order dreadnought. Or I'd have it as Onager Class Siege Breakers.

The Sith Wayfinder will just be called a Sith Holocron.

Next i'd explain that Palpatine is a clone.

For Force Heal, I would have it so that Jedi can heal small wounds but not bring people back to life.

For the Rey VS Kylo part I would have Duel of the Fates playing

For the Kijimi Explosion scene i'd have it as several 

The rest of the film will remain the same except for the Battle of Exegol part
I wouldn't have the horses on a star destroyer's hull scene, I would have it on the ground.
I would also have the star destroyers get to space so that the space battle is evenly matched. When the Resistance fleet arrives, I will also add in some Venators, ISDs, Nebulas, and Sepratists ships to the fleet, then I will show the space battle. I'd even have Palpatine tell the Sith Fleet to turn against the First Order because Kylo Ren is now good. And since the First Order will listen to Kylo no matter what, i'll have a First Order fleet there as well for a 3 way battle.

Instead of having Rey VS Palpatine, I would have Force Ghost Anakin VS Palpatine, Anakin will then kill Palpatine, comepleting the Chosen One prophecy. Then I will continue the space battle and in the end the Resistance wins by shooting Proton Torpedos INTO the Star Destroyer siege cannons. And for the ""people rising all over the galaxy, I'd show a space battle on several planets, even prequel ones. Also, I am gonna remove the Rey and Ben kiss.

Then, I'd show a nice celebration scene on Coruscant.

Finally, for the Rey ""Skywalker"" part, I'd have it instead be Rey Palpatine, because the lesson should be ""Never be afraid of who you are"" like Leia says.

36,Attachment: An idea for a Star Wars Movie/Series,1593985791,"Attachment in the PT and OT is a major theme. The Jedi forbade attachments, the Sith attempt to attach to power. For the last few days I've been thinking about a movie/series idea discovering the origins of why the Jedi forbade this.

Technological Developement: Space travel (maybe not Hyperspace). Some species and cultures maybe less developed, but have the potential to advance rapidly with exposure to others technologies. The technology for each planet is very diverse and represents the development from the unique species and environments on different world. Planets have hovercrafts, walker, and maybe even wheeled (more primative planet) vehicles. 

Weapons: Various styles and types of vibroblades for melee. 
Laser blasters would be early in development making them larger and mostly stationary or vehicle based or for the very rich. 
Slug-throwers are the handheld weapon of choice for most individuals seeking longer range.

The Force: Force-sensitives exist, but there are many excuses and explanations different cultures have decided on for their existence. Some cultures revere the users, others militarized them, some might hunt them (Trandosian type), and another culture just isn't aware of it.

Cultures/Religion: Polytheistic worship of monstrous  non-sentient species. 
Science/Technology based society, only what is seen and observed is believed by adults of the planet. Child are sometimes force-sensitive, but through education they lose their abilities and rely on technology. 
Monotheistic worship of a girl that died and accidentally became a force ghost.

Governments: A few planets have begun to form treaties, trade agreements, and coalitions in the hope of uniting planets and species. 
Planetary civil war that other planets are trying to stay out of, but get dragged into. 
Planetary Nationalism where all sentient species from one planet are resisting other planets influences, but need other worlds for trade.

Cast and Ideas around Attachment:

Mahershala Ali and Lakeith Stanfield are members of the military on Nationalistic Planet. Both are force-sensitive vibroblade wielding badasses. They would have to learn through the attempt to hold onto and eventual loss of their Nationalism that if their planet is to survive in the wider galactic system they must let go of their attachment to power in the government and Nationalism. This is driven by Mahershala's visions of other force-sensitives on other planets and impending supply shortages on his planet.

Sam Witwer (force-sensitive and alien species) is a part of a cult obsessed with the force ghost false deity (Alison Brie). He treads on the brink of obsession and insanity. The force ghost is beginning to push and test her cultists, mainly because she gets bored. The other force-sensitives battle with him (as he is sent to destroy them), but eventually they help him to see the truth and together they confront the mad cultists (Pilou Asbæk) and their false deity, not destroying her, but bringing her to peace.

Keanu Reeves (not force-sensitive) has a child who is force-sensitive. They are refugees on the planet with the civil war. The child's mother was killed basically by both factions. Keanu tries to remain a pacifist while protecting his child, trying to find safety for them, and grieving the loss of his partner. After connecting with the other force-users Keanu, becomes the major philosophical mind and even though he has no force power he is connected to it and helps the others to understand a deeper light side connection. Keanu will eventually sacrifice himself to save the others. His child will have greater understanding of giving up attachments and becomes a powerful force-user through finding peace. With the help of the other planet force-sensitives they bring peace to the civil war only after letting go of the attachments they hold onto.

Nasim Pedrad (force-sensitive) is a starship mechanic that begins secret relationship with a pilot from a different species (force-sensitive) that is forbidden on some planets, but not others. Her droid is voiced by Jeff Goldblum. Not sure where to go with this one, but you get the idea attachments and letting go.

I've been thinking about this story and the idea of attachments for a few days, but (for a long time) I've been hoping Lucasfilm would start take creative risks toward expanding the origins of the force. I think Star Wars is at it's best when their are more possibilities in the universe. Something old is explained, but much more is left open. 

A lot of these ideas are coming to me as I try to process current events. I don't want to be political at all, but I'm trying to do everything I can to keep my family as safe as possible during this time. Yet, I'm more constantly aware of the injustices of this world. This duality of my mind really reminds me of the struggles in Star Wars of having attachments to that which is most valuable to an individual, the desire to protect and keep it safe and making the right sacrifices in order to bring about positive progression for all.

This is my first time writing and posting story ideas I've had, thank you for reading. Let me know if you like it hate it or have idea to expand it.

TLDR: A group of force-sensitives from different planets are drawn together to discover their force powers, solve planetary crises, and they have to let go of attachments helping to build the foundations of the Jedi Order.",StarWars,beren170,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hluyqx/attachment_an_idea_for_a_star_wars_movieseries/

TCL said that by killing snoke Rian Johnson left no awesome villain for J.J. Abrams other than to resurrect Palpatine, which leads to TCL creating a new villain altogether in his version of the story. It's disappointing to see how everyone just ignores Thrawn and his whole story Arc, and it's even more frustrating that the storyline that TCL created sounded perfect for Thrawn rather than the other race that he talked about ( don't remember the name ).

The rest of the film is actually quite good, it builds well on the lore, with maul and the syndicates, new planets and new creatures, it helps add to the OT characters and it had exciting action and chase scenes.

The last 30 minutes is tainted by the fact that we now have to suddenly like this group of bandits that murdered two of Tobias’ closest friends and caused Han to be caught up further with the Crimson Dawn. 

The scene where she tells the story of the villagers having their tongues removed was clearly meant to be shocking and profound with all the silly filmography but it just came across as flat. 

There was no reason to root for them when we’ve spent the last hour wanting Han to get his score and get out. 

These characters could have been made interesting and key to the story throughout the whole movie but they instead were relegated to 2 scenes, both of which involved screwing over the main characters.",StarWars,DANIELG360,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hlsyzc/enfys_nest_marauders_ruined_solo/
49,The Differences in how the Jedi and Sith train their students,1593978530,"I posted this following paragraph on the Speculation Sub, discussing how TROS potentially recontextualizes the rule of two:

Palpatine’s line “I am all the sith” and the legion of dark hooded figures behind him, alludes to the idea that when an apprentice kills his/her master, not only is the sith covenant passed along but so too is their force essence, forever bonded to them. It follows, guides, and strengthens the apprentice and makes him truly the master. The passes along of the torch is what makes a sith all powerful. So Palpatine’s destruction of the Jedi order isn’t just the work of a genius politician but the culmination of a 1000 years of sith work. And it’s nice to know that the sighs of old got a front row seat look at the Jedi’s destruction along side Palpatine. This also literally explains the title “Dark Lord of the Sith”.

And then I came across this idea:

It's basically the opposite of how the Jedi train their students. In TLJ, Yoda tells Luke ""we are what they grow beyond, that is the true burden of all masters"", meaning that the master has finally accomplished his role once the next generation has grown past them, the ultimate act of compassion. Whereas the sith rely on extreme selfishness and personal strength/power.

Selflessness is what happens with Ben, reviving Rey by sacrificing his life to save her -- passing peacefully into the force, finally free from his pain. Selfishness is what happens with Palpatine, having all the power of the sith but dangling from a humongous machine, clinging on to dear life while suffering immeasurable pain.",StarWars,ShambolicClown,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hlsw3c/the_differences_in_how_the_jedi_and_sith_train/
50,"Beat Jedi: Fallen Order recently, it had some fun parts, but my word that game seems overrated to me.",1593978299,"Warning: rant incoming.

It's good people have enjoyed this game, I eventually began to enjoy it when I had accepted the general bugginess and reached locations and gained powers that made things more exciting for me. However I don't think this game deserves half the praise it has gotten. I mean I know ign is famous for it's overly forgiving and generous reviews but a 9/10? It's absurd.

JFO has so many flaws, it's the buggiest game I think I've ever played. There are a lot of awkward animations. The story and ability upgrades are bizarrely paced. The cosmetics are a joke. The map is awful. The level design is unremarkable. Tons of mechanics and gameplay elements are ripped straight out of other stuff, I wouldn't have a huge problem with this, but if you're going to copy a bunch of gameplay elements that have been around for years and years then the game should at least run properly. If Respawn wasn't putting a huge amount of effort into creative design, they really ought to have put more effort into polish. And on top of all that, when I was finally really starting to enjoy the game it ended way too early. Seriously there should've been at least 2 more planets to visit, ideally 3, I feel like 5 hours of story got cut out or something. Overall so much about this game screams ""RUSHED DEVELOPMENT!"" to me.

I know it's a damn miracle EA actually made a singleplayer SW game without any mtx, and if you like this game please continue to enjoy it, it certainly has its good parts and they're worth experiencing as a SW fan, I'm actually considering trying ng+ to give it a second chance and see if I can squeeze out any more fun. BUT please can we agree this game should not have been getting near perfect scores and oodles of praise? This game was a baby-step in the right direction, we should be demanding better.

Rey was grown to be the best in everything. And her behaviour represents it.

She is rude and arrogant teenager, who is aware of her power and dark nature. She likes to show her powers around, and basically saying: ""I'm better than you!"" She also seems thick-skinned, because despite the fact that other padawans fear her, she isn't influenced by this.

Rey is a loner, and doesn't likes romance. She got her friend Ben in a friend zone, but later, was too proud to accept that she felt in love with him.

But also, she is a very difficult character, with flaws sticking everywhere out of her - she wants her power to be recognised, and always wants more. She has teenager problems - like when she wants to be able to go on missions herself, not with the help of her Master - Luke.

65,"A comedy podcast with Mark Hamill where he talks in-depth about Corvette Summer, his first movie after Star Wars.",1593969668,"I did a podcast with Mark Hamill, Annie Potts and Steve Molaro.

Steve was showrunner on The Big Bang Theory and is co-creator of Young Sheldon. He wanted to talk about Corvette Summer – a 1978 film starring Mark and Annie (who is on Young Sheldon), so he persuaded them to come along for the ride.

It’s a comedy podcast, so there’s lots of teasing and laughing – but also more serious discussion about how Mark wanted to do a low-key film after Star Wars and how he tried to move into new characters. What it was like for Annie doing her first film and for both of them, whether actors should go back to watch previous performances and how they see their earlier work.

Of course the thrust is about Corvette Summer itself, how it was filmed, how the characters changed and more. Steve talks about writing for a big TV show and what it’s like living with established characters.

It’s interesting to listen to all of them, but for /r/starwars it’s a unique insight into what Hamill was thinking just as his star was ascending.

86,So my dad works at Lucasfilm (satire),1593961481,"#This post is having a laugh at the “my uncle works at Lucasfilm” posts. I’ve seen a few on Twitter, so I thought I might make my own and mock them. It’s a bit fun and jokes, so don’t take it seriously. 

So I gathered some information from what I’ve heard from my dad when I sneaked on set during The Rise of Skywalker. Basically, JJ and Terrio were constantly drinking on set, hence the constant re-writes, they just randomly picked up the pencil every now and then and decided they’d write whatever they wanted.

My mum was a co producer and she said Kathleen Kennedy didn’t give them enough money to make the film so she went to Bob Iger and threatened to release a secret that he’s secretly gay and having a threesome unless he gave them the funds. 

My aunt is part of the creative story group and she says Kylo and Rey’s kiss was forced and non consensual, Bob Iger demanded they do it so the Reylo stan accounts on Twitter would shut up. They were blackmailed an extra few million on top of their pay check so they wouldn’t speak out. 

My uncle also works at Lucasfilm, and he told me that Ian took drugs prior to shooting his bass boosted lighting scene, he went totally insane and killed bunch of actors on set.

87,Empire TaunTaun scene doesn’t make sense,1593960181,"Okay here me out I had a strange realization. So we know that lightsabers cauterize wounds as they create them, throughout all of the movies we see a lot of people lose body parts to a lightsaber, but there’s never any blood, which means the plasma in lightsabers is hot enough to cauterize the wound. 

In the beginning of Empire when Han finds Luke half frozen on Hoth, he uses his lightsaber to slice open a TaunTaun and put him inside it’s stomach to keep him warm, which I thought was a very gruesome yet interesting scene. Thinking back on it I’m not so sure it would even be possible to do that with a lightsaber though, because I’m pretty sure it would cauterize the cut as it went. Just food for thought, anybody else notice this?

20,"Rey is a clone of Ben Solo, Snoke a betrayed apprentice of Palpatine: changes I would have made to TROS",1593927360,"Overall I didn't mind TROS that much, and I love Ian McDiarmid, but bringing Palpatine back as the main villain really undercuts the entire point of I-VI, and Rey's backstory just didn't feel properly fleshed out. I have a few ideas that I think could have ended Ben's, Rey's, and Luke's stories in a much more satisfying way that respects the OT better, as well as explain Snoke and Rey's powers more sensibly. 

- Emperor doesn't come back (as awesome as it was to see McDiarmid again, it really ruined the entire point of of 1-6), but perhaps he could still be present in flashbacks, recordings or as an AI avatar (like in Battlefront II).
- Rey isn't a Palpatine, continues to be ""nobody"" (Not really a fan of TLJ revealing this but I would have stayed committed to it rather than doubling back on it like TROS did).

- It is revealed that Snoke is a former apprentice of Palpatine's, whom Palpatine cast aside, similar to Dooku (I think this is better than making Snoke Plagueis. Snoke barely survived this betrayal and retreated to the unknown regions of the galaxy, explaining his disfigurement and appearance out of nowhere. Snoke hid for decades plotting his revenge, but was pleasantly surprised when he heard Palpatine was killed by a man named Skywalker. Snoke uses this opportunity to recruit the remnants of the Empire under him, and begins searching for his new apprentice, initially wanting to find the one named ""Skywalker"".

- Snoke battles Luke but Luke is too strong for him, Snoke realizes it is smarter for him to find someone with just as much strength potential but can be easily manipulated. He decides to use Ben to kill Luke (by manipulating him to destroy the Jedi Temple) and become his apprentice. After losing the Temple and all his apprentices to Ben and Snoke with the Knights of Ren hunting him and any remaining Jedi down, Luke decides to disappear. (I don't think this is what Luke would really do but I'm going along with the events of TFA and TLJ as closely as possible).

- After turning Ben Solo and training him, Snoke is disappointed in how 'weak' Ben is. Snoke decides to use Ben's DNA (without his knowledge) to create a clone of him, but alters it to be Ben's 'opposite'. Big reveal that Rey is a clone of Ben, explaining her power and their 'dyad'; accelerated aging explaining their age difference, and why her parents were ""no one"". Ben knew through The Force that Rey is a clone, but not that she is a clone of him (though he has had this suspicion).

- Rey doesn't turn out as expected for Snoke and he orders Ben to kill her, but Ben decides he can't kill a little girl and instead hides her away, where he thinks she will never be found or realize her powers.

- After killing Snoke in TLJ, Kylo is the main villain of IX and is a beast. After her refusal to join him he realizes the profound threat she poses he is obsessed with killing her. They duel in the beginning of the movie and he comes very close to killing her, gravely injures her but she escapes. He continues searching for her but in this time discovers she is a clone of him and reveals to her that all her power is actually his, unearned and untamed. Rey is emotionally destroyed by this reveal, they duel again and Kylo bests her again; is about to kill her but stops when Leia reaches out to him. Realizing they truly are one in the same, Kylo abandons the First Order and decides to join Rey. Hux assumes control.

- Ben and Rey aid the Resistance in a massive final battle against Hux and the First Order, Hux is killed and the First Order is destroyed, Ben and Rey both live, and start a new Jedi order together. Flash forward a few years, Ben is a few years older but Rey is an old woman. There is a new school of Jedi they have trained together, Rey dies of old age but dies happy, having lived as full a life as she could. Ben buries her and continues on as the last true Skywalker.

(If killing her is too sad of an ending, we can just remove the flash forward from the end of the movie and glaze over Rey's accelerated aging).

26,"Here's my unpopular opinion: the Jedi absolutely did not deserve what happened to them, nor were they responsible for Anakin's fall to the dark side.",1593924643,"I see a lot of people here and on other social platforms commenting things like ""the Jedi's fall was long overdue"", or blaming Anakin's turn to the dark side on the Jedi Code, or even saying the Jedi deserved what happened to them. I couldn't disagree more.

Note - this will be a very long post, as I want to address the main points in detail. I will do my best to get to the point but I also want to make sure it sticks. If you decide to stick around until the end, thanks for hearing me out.

First, you could make the argument that what happened to the Jedi was genocide. By definition, genocide is ""the deliberate killing of a large group of people, especially those of a particular ethnic group or nation"". Did the Jedi not share the same values, beliefs, norms, rituals/traditions, and social structure? Were they not systematically massacred en masse, including the children, the elderly, the healers and scholars who weren't active on the battlefield, the ones who had nothing to do with Anakin or the Council, for no reason other than the fact that they were Jedi? Did they deserve to be slaughtered on the spot like that? Call it what you want, but the Jedi Order sure as hell didn't ""collapse"" or ""fall"".

Also, I see a lot of people defending order 66 and Anakin's turn to the dark side because he brought balance to the Force. That isn't how it works, balance in the Force doesn't mean # of Sith = # of Jedi. Balance means equilibrium and George Lucas has said himself that balance in the Force means no Sith at all. Sure, Anakin killed Palpatine (sequels? don't know her) but the Force was unbalanced in the first place because there were too many Sith, NOT because there were too many Jedi.

The Jedi don't forbid attachments; there's *selfish* love and *selfless* love. You can love all you want, but if the time comes where you have to choose between saving a thousand innocent civilians or saving your lover, you have to be able to recognize and choose the right thing to do. This is precisely what Anakin couldn't do: ""he weighed Padmé’s life against the Jedi Order. It was no contest."" (from the ROTS novelization). If you can't learn to bear the responsibilities, then it's simple - just leave the Order and go off and do your own thing. You can't have your cake and eat it. If the Jedi allowed attachments that were as possessive and unhealthy as Anakin's, they would be no different than the Sith.

Remember, there was peace in the galaxy for over a millennium. The Jedi were peacekeepers, forced out of their depths, leading a *war* (if aliens invaded the earth tomorrow, we wouldn't turn to the monks in the Himalayas, we would turn to the goddamn military). They had to make harder and harder decisions as the war went on and sometimes that included deviating from the Code. That doesn't mean they were hypocrites, or corrupt, or ""needed to be abolished"", or ""deserved to be wiped out"". They were doing their best in unprecedented circumstances.

Finally, you also give too little credit to Palpatine. He's *smart*; he had backup plans for his backup plans; he would've orchestrated the purge regardless of what Anakin was doing. Anakin's fall was meticulously planned and carried out for over a decade. Do you think he would've still turned if Palpatine hadn't spent the better part of 13 years pulling him away from the Code and his morals, heightening his insecurities, encouraging the same possessive attachment that was later used against him?

Was Anakin a special case? Yes. Could they have handled his upbringing better? Maybe. That's a discussion for another day. Was the Jedi Code perfect? No. Were the Jedi perfect? No. Was the Order corrupt? Absolutely not. Did they deserved to be massacred? Absolutely not. Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.

Just something I thought of today. Anyway, I call it “KINDRED: A Star Wars Story.”",1593900570,"After news that their families, which fought on the side of the First Order, were killed during the war; 6 cousins from a village on some remote world, break all ties with their past and set out to find adventure. 
After selling their family homes, they book passage on a frigate and head to a pioneer system.

While traveling, they come across an unexpected New Republic outpost, one of many the New Republic have established in an effort to lay the groundwork for a less centralized government. 
The platoon occupying the outpost is filled with unkind soldiers and officers who lost everything to Starkiller Base and aren’t looking for hope, but rather power in whatever shape it‘s available.

Upon checking the cousin’s papers and discovering their connection to members of the First Order, 3 of them are killed in an unexpected and VERY SUDDEN Mexican standoff. The remaining cousin’s innocence is destroyed forever as they narrowly escape with their lives. 

After returning home from this traumatic event, the three remaining cousins, two young men and a young woman, all head in different directions and paths.

15 years later;

The female cousin, Tieu Shadowblake, has become an inquisitor on Coruscant, which was untouched by Starkiller Base and is now governed remotely by the Senate on an unknown planet code named Wandar.

Shadowblake is quite good at her job, her tempestuous relationship with her partner, a C7K-IS Investigative Droid she calls “Seven,” not withstanding. They are regarded by those that know them most as probably the best detectives on the  planet.

One day they get wind of a possible bombing that might happen in their sector of the city-world and a lockdown commences as full forces are deployed. Tensions rise as news reports of an insidious shadow group rising in the city-world give way to escalating inquisition/civilian encounters. 
As Shadowblake investigates, she learns that the terrorrists aren’t planning to bomb the city-world, but rather turn the planet itself into a bomb.

During her investigation she discovers that her cousin, Ran Shadowblake, who was rumored to have became a gangster after they last saw each other, is now a boss amongst the Hutts (no small feat). Hot on his trail and empowered by a passion for uncovering the truth, her and Seven come across her other cousin, Faun Cinder, who has somehow become the student of a mysterious Jedi widely believed to be a myth called “The Child.”  

Faun Cinder reveals that although the Jedi have been gone for a long time, the death of Luke Skywalker was a sign for The Child to come forth and restore the balance that was prophesied long ago. Because of this, The Child has dispatched several of his Padawans to different sectors preemptively seeking to stop the rise of The Second Dawn, a group made up of former Shadow Collective/Crimson Dawn members lead by the double duel lightsaber (yes, 4 total) wielding Dathomirian Zabrak named Brome; Savage Opress’ daughter. 

Ran, partnered with Brome, and with an army provided by the Hutts, begin a campaign of terror on Coruscant, hoping to steal the entire New Galactic Reserve to fund the Second Dawn. 

Thwarted by Tieu Shadowblake, Seven and Faun Cinder (a la John Mclayne), they take back the New Republic Reserve convoy, ensuring that Brome’s attempt on the government’s financial stability does not see fruition. Ran reveals (as he escapes in the nick of time on the back of Brome’s ship) that Brome’s actual plan was to keep the New Republic forces occupied so as to discover the location and then bomb the Senate on Wandar. 

Faun Cinder deduces that Ran’s involvement with Brome was likely due to 3 senators once having been  outpost guards that killed their 3 cousins.

Before Faun Cinder, Seven and Tieu Shadowblake can stop them, Brome, Ran and the Second Dawn achieve their goals in toppling the fledgling New Republic and setting themselves up as the new leaders of the galaxy. 

Running for their lives and against her protests, Faun Cinder takes Tieu Shadowblake and Seven to Wandar and investigate the assassinations of each individual senator. It seems 7 of the New Republic outpost guards that killed her family turned into Senators, and while 3 were killed in the bombing by Brome, 4 are now working for her as governors of several sectors under the New Empire. 

While on Wandar, Brome reveals that the person killed by general Obiwan Kenobi on the planet Tatooine was not Darth Maul, but a clone that had been commissioned to a Kaminoan at the behest of the real Darth Maul.  
Just then, she names the new emperor to be none other than her uncle and master, Darth Maul himself. 

Faun Cinder communicates with his master that the New Empire has taken control and Maul is now the emperor and the Jedi must come out of hiding and fight once again.

A day later - the warrior and only one of his kind, once believed to be a myth, now proven to be real, arrives. He is the Jedi Knight proficient in Mandalorian fighting tactics and referred to only as “The Child.” 

Now that they are together, Coruscant’s best investigators, Tieu Shadowblake and Seven, the Padawan Faun Cinder, the Mandalorian Jedi Knight called The Child and his former master, Ahsoka Tano; hope is sparked across the galaxy once again.",StarWars,Grimmerghost,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hlbps1/i_have_no_idea_if_this_is_any_good_but_just_so/

18,Proof Disney changed the plot to TROS last minute.,1593897209,"A while back there was a rumor on r/starwarsleaks that a version of TROS included the characters meeting some sort of Oracle. 

[concept art here](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsLeaks/comments/eph10e/concept_art_of_the_oracle/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)

It was later [confirmed](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsLeaks/comments/fen927/tros_creative_director_neal_scanlan_confirms_that/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) that this was true by TROS's own creative director. 

Back in Agust/ September, when I first moved to California, I went to Galaxy's Edge and in one of the stores in the marketplace I found a plushie of the oracle. I then assumed the leaks to be true. 

Fast forward and the sub starts getting a bunch of leaks that the plot has changed and the Oracle is no longer a part of it. Since I'm a cast member I used to be able to go to the parks whenever I wanted before they closed. So, I went back to the same stall in the marketplace to find the Oracle and it was gone. I asked the cast members who worked the store where it had gone and they said that they were suddenly asked to get rid of them without explanation. This was probably around October. 

I'm just sharing this because I think it proves how down to the wire major decisions like this were made. Just 2 months before the movie was released, they were selling plushies for a character that would never appear. 

I wish I had taken a picture of it when I first saw the plushie but at the time I didnt see the point. I thought everyone was going to know what it was eventually so I didnt think it was a big deal. 

You may chose not to believe me but I promise I'm telling the truth and will answer any questions you have. 

I'm sharing now because it has been weighing on my mind that I feel like I'm one of the only people who knows about this.

Edit: I feel the need to add that this post is more about highlighting the fact that they changed things so soon before release more than it is about who did the changing.",StarWars,brittneyb123,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hlatkz/proof_disney_changed_the_plot_to_tros_last_minute/

71,How The Rise of Skywalker ties up the Whole Saga,1593882507,"The Palpatine redemption by Skywalker arc that is basically the bookend of the entire saga is the core of TROS's thematic conclusion. I'm still amazed at the brilliance of that idea and how it all joins together across all nine episodes.

I noticed that TROS itself is a thematic expansion of ROTS, centered on the conversation between Palpatine and Skywalker during the opera scene. When Anakin's grandson Ben is introduced to Palpatine at the beginning of the ""conversation"" of TROS it's under the theme of using the dark side to cheat death in a way that is unnatural, echoed in the line used by Palpatine in both scenes.

Then as Anakin's grandson is ending the ""conversation"" of TROS, he uses the force to keep the one he loves from dying. And it turns out you can learn this power from the Jedi, after all. The conversation swayed Anakin to turn to the dark side out of love, in effort to save Padme, but ended up causing Padme to die; but the conversation swayed Anakin 2.0 to turn to the light side out of love, in effort to save Padme 2.0, and ends up causing Padme 2.0 to live.

I notice that the PT (building into the third episode) is about loss; the loss of love, the loss of identity, the loss of the name Skywalker; the ST (also building into the third episode) is about finding; the finding of love, the finding of identity, the finding of the name Skywalker.

The mutually beneficial symbiotic relationship which is the central theme of the first episode TPM comes back to find its thematic culmination in the mutually beneficial symbiotic Skywalker/Palpatine relationship of the final episode.

In the first episode TPM, Skywalker leaves home to become a Jedi, in the last episode TROS, Skywalker comes home after becoming a Jedi.

The final dialogue of TROS directly relates to the themes central to Rey across the ST: ""There's been no one for so long"" is her theme in episode seven. ""Who are you?"" is her theme in episode eight. ""Rey Skywalker"" is her theme in episode nine. Even the actions are thematically connected; for example Rey first gives no family name, then turns to see Luke and Leia which then causes her to claim the Skywalker name, reflecting her journey through the ST in first having no family name, then turning to find Luke and then Leia her teachers, who through kindness allow her to come to the realization of her identity as of the same spirit - Rey Skywalker.",StarWars,ShambolicClown,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hl6rlj/how_the_rise_of_skywalker_ties_up_the_whole_saga/

92,"Might be controversial, idek, but Disney SW isn't that bad",1593877881,"I just posted this on unpopular opinions, but apparently I violate their guidelines with this post so it got taken down. Have nowhere else to post it but here. You obviously don't have to agree with me, as I think this will be controversial on here, but that's why I originally wanted to put it on unpopular opinions.

I've been hearing a lot about Disney erasing their movies from canon, and all I have to say about that is only do E9. I'm here to say that Disney Star Wars isn't bad, and honestly, is decent overall.

I have a friend who fucking despises Disney Star Wars, and acts as if people that like E8 and E9 are the spawns of Satan, and that everyone who goes ""haha disney bad"" are factually correct. He also says that they aren't canon, when they are. I for one, really like E8. It's my favorite ST movie, as a matter of fact. I really do believe the only terrible Disney movie is E9. I'll go through each movie and quickly summarize why I think the movies are decent, and really not bad at all.

TL;DR: TFA: cool, Rogue One: meh. TLJ: pretty damn cool, ngl, Solo: damn I like this a lot, ROS: This movie should have never fucking existed

TFA: Nostalgia to bring back old fans, and introduces new, fun, and exciting characters. Also builds a mystery with Luke, and why he's gone. Rey shows potential, and hasn't become a Mary-Sue yet, while Kylo is built up to be a great villain. Solid movie, low B tier SW movie

Rogue-One: Least favorite SW movie, but it's certainly not a bad movie. It's a very meh move imo, being quite boring, with non-interesting characters except Jynn, and Cassian. It's quite boring throughout except for a few scenes. But this is somewhat made up for by having a fantastic ending, and by ending, I mean all of Scarif. WOW. The last 40 minutes of this movie are fucking awesome. But overall, a meh movie imo. C tier SW movie

TLJ: This is the source of my unpopular opinion, and is by far the longest section of this post. TLJ is sooo controversial, and I totally get why. I totally understand why people hate this movie, but at the same time, I think people hate on this movie blindly. This movie has the best visuals in any SW movie, great character development from Kylo, Finn, and Poe (all ruined in E9, fuck that movie. I'll elaborate on why they were great later), very interesting interactions between Rey (who wasn't a Mary-Sue *quite* yet, and she was a good character as well) and Luke. Luke as a whole was actually very interesting imo. The fact he went from this super powerful Jedi, to a hermit who feels responsible for bring the First Order to the galaxy. It shows how Luke is human and that he can get too comfortable to peace, and is why he freaked out on Ben when he saw the vision. The final fight scene where he makes his final sacrifice to save the resistance was also great because it shows a great character arc in this movie of Luke going from a hopeless hermit, to having hope again. All of his interactions with Rey that hint towards her being a dark force user is also great foreshadowing (Though this is something I'm torn on because of my next point), and making her the child of nobodies is awesome. This movie's main flaw is the Canto Bight subplot. Canto Bight was pretty dumb, and this random guy that can crack the code for some fucking reason is stupid. But this subplot also brought us some good development of Poe going from a reckless pilot, to a true leader who can actually lead an army. It turned Finn from a coward who just wants to run, into someone who knows he can be a hero, and someone that'll take sacrifices to save the lives of many others, and character arc would have ended his character perfectly if he died during the Battle of Crait (don't even hate Rose actually, but she fucked that scene up). And Kylo just got more evil. The way he just killed Snoke so he could then take over the galaxy with Rey was incredible imo. The fight scene with Luke was great as well. But just to end on a negative note, Leia flying was some of the dumbest shit I've ever seen, and Holdo was an annoying bitch. Overall, I actually think TLJ was a very mixed bag, but a lot of it's ""flaws"" are pretty based on opinion, such as Luke's character in this movie. I'll reiterate though: I understand why people really don't like this movie, but I just wanted to explain why I, personally, really liked it. If there are any other flaws that I didn't mention, please bring them up because I probably missed a few, and I would like to give my opinion on them. Verdict, pretty good movie imo, solid high B tier SW movie

Solo: Favorite SW Disney movie. Don't have much to say other than it being super entertaining. Beckett was a great character, Qi'ra was pretty solid, and young Lando was also fun. Seeing the Kessel Run was nice, and seeing Han build his relationship with Chewie and Lando was cool. My favorite part of this movie though is definitely Beckett. I loved him. It's not a great movie, but I think it's a pretty decent one. High B tier SW movie

ROS: Oh God... This movie is a travesty. Truly the only Disney movie I wish wasn't canon. This movie has a solid first half, but totally goes downhill after the Kylo v Rey fight imo. So much wrong with it. Bringing Palpatine back isn't the issue, but the way they did it was terrible. He shouldn't have been alive, should have been back in a different way. Rey went full Mary-Sue in this movie. Finn and Poe were totally reduced to comic relief, and I mean 100% reduced. Finn was literally just ""REYYYYYY"" in this movie. And yes, this is his main flaw throughout these movies, but I thought that when he was good, he was really good, but he had way more potential then what was used. By bringing Palpatine back, they made Anakin's whole arc obsolete. Making Snoke a clone was fucking terrible because he was pretty cool in 7 and 8. Making Kylo the love interest was laughable, and making him revive Rey with A FUCKING KISS is awful. Turning Kylo light isn't the issue, but the way they did it was terrible. The resistance took out a massive fleet of SDs with the power of the Death Star by going ""haha space horse go neigh."" Hux being the spy isn't terrible, but it was out of fucking nowhere. WTF? The whole ""gotcha!"" moments with 3PO and Chewie were disgusting. JJ really pissed and shat all over the SW legacy with this movie imo. This movie was a lot fine ideas, just terrible execution. I really hate this movie, but it's fun to make fun of because of how bad it is. Low D tier SW movie, probably the worst, maybe better than E1.

So after all of that, I really don't think Disney SW is that bad. E9 is disgusting, but other than that, they're all meh to decent. While I like the PT more, I think Disney made better all around movies. The Prequels are better SW movies though, if that makes sense? If Disney actually makes them non-canon, I honestly won't care that much though because I'd do anything to make ROS non-canon. I can still watch the other ones and enjoy them knowing that ROS is at least non-canon. If Disney actually does this though, there's no reason Rogue-One and Solo should also be removed because they don't affect the Skywalker Saga in many ways. Anyways, that was a very long post that no one will see, and anyone that does see it, won't read it because it's a metric shit ton of writing, but if anyone actually took the time to read it, thank you. You obviously don't have to agree with me, and I'm pretty sure this is an unpopular opinion.

0,"Introducing The Clone Wars: Compromise Order - The Best of Release, Chronological and Ultimate Order",1593876392,"As you may know, The Clone Wars initially aired out of order. As well as this, they revisited certain stories with prequel/sequel episodes in later seasons. This means that watching the show in release order can be a bit messy. To fix this a chronological order has been formed and is even available officially on starwars.com [Here](https://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-the-clone-wars-chronological-episodeorder). Then there’s The Ultimate order, put together on reddit by u/Sapitoelgato [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCloneWars/comments/e0htwt/the_clone_wars_ultimate_edition_2019/) that makes more changes in order to try and make the show flow better.

Each order has it’s own pros and cons;

**Release Order:**

Pros:    
+ Simplest to navigate    
+ Animation quality (mostly) steadily improves    
+ Follows ""intended"" story order    
+ Many people have nostalgia for this order

Cons:    
- Out of Order, often a character will die and then several seasons later there will a backstory episode that takes place before it

**Chronological Order:**

Pros:    
+ Fixes most prequel episodes

Cons:    
- Can be hard to navigate, with lots of jumping around    
- In many ways, changes the way the story was originally told    
- Many changes seem unnecessary    
- Some episodes that seem like they should be moved, aren’t moved.

**Ultimate Order:**

Pros:    
+ Moves some episodes that needed moving, that weren’t moved in the chronological order

Cons:    
- Moves many arcs around to an order where character development is no longer presented as the show-makers intended, but instead as the order maker preferred.    

Each order is good in its own right, and has its fans, they're each like a different flavour to watch the clone wars in. But I decided to try and make a compromise of all three, using the following priorities;

* Story and Character Development
* Chronology
* Simplicity

What I’ve come up with is an order that keeps most stories in chronological order, but with changes to cut down on jumping around and/or preserve the original story of release order. I found that some changes have been made for the sake of chronology even though the story is now weaker, so for every episode/arc that's out of order the rule I used was ""If this was the ONLY episode/arc out of order, would people move it?"". I found that certain backstory episodes were better left until later as a flashback, rather than being moved and ruining story or character development.

I’ve arranged it into a table with episode number, title and arc (so that you can see before hand if the next episode you watch is part of a new arc, I highly recommend watching whole arcs in one sitting). Arc names indicate the start of an arc and ----- indicates a stand-alone episode. I’ve also put a little reference [A] occasionally to explain my decision for any placements that differ from release order, some explanations have a spoiler part to them like so &gt;!Example!&lt;. The explanations are below the table. There's also a simplified list at the bottom.

[A] Clone Wars 2003 is no longer canon but is definitely worth a watch, the whole thing is only 2 hours and introduces many characters that appear in the 3D show (who appear in the 3D show without a new introduction). I find it best to watch the whole thing first rather than trying to split it up and fit it around the 3D show, as it's best enjoyed on it's own.

[B] Chronological order puts 216 and 116 before the movie but in my opinion they feel like random episodes designed to be enjoyed later, not as the viewers introduction to the series. The movie has a very cinematic feel and should be watched first. I left 116 where it was as it felt right there, and moved 216 before it so that together they act as a flashback.

[C] Same as Chronological Order, very important move for story reasons.

[D] CO puts 116 before the movie and 301 after it, but I feel they're better watched after 101 and 102 as it fits better with the clones character development. &gt;!In CO, you see a clone traitor, then see their training, before yoda ""introduces"" them in 101, ruining their development. In this order, Yoda gives a touching talk to the clones in 101, there's an important interaction between Plo &amp;amp;amp; the clones in 102, you get to see their training and working together in the Domino Sqaud arc, before eventually seeing a clone traitor in 116, preserving both chronology and story. Plus as a happy accident the Domino Squad arc ends up as one piece.!&lt;

[E] Same as Ultimate order, there's some behind the scenes explanations as to why it's left in S3, but nothing to indicate that in the episode, in my opinion it needs to be watched after 105.

[F] I've left these as release order, I couldn't find a reason anywhere as to why they were moved, so for simplicity and nostalgia they're staying. If anything I found several reasons not to move them; &gt;!There's a billboard of Palpatine here that you first see in 211 that is better seen there first, as you hear Palpatine slowly start to blame the Jedi for everything. There's references to The Second Battle of Geonosis which hasn't happened yet if you watch it in CO. Plus this acts as a nice break between the Mandalore, Boba Fett and Corruption on Mandalore arcs.!&lt;

[G] Again I have no idea why CO moves this one, there doesn't seem to be any reason, all moving it does is create more jumping around, as well as split up the ""Ziro Episodes"" after it. I also think it works as a better first episode for S3 than 305 now that 301-303 have moved to S1. And also &gt;!Ahsoka mentions it's the first time she's done a mind trick, and she does it again in 306. So this should be before 306!&lt;

[H] This arc was originally intended for S5 before being pushed to S6. People give several other reasons for moving it including Yoda's old model, the voice of Ian Abercrombie (who passed away and was recast in S5), but there's one very spoilery reason to do with later events, that I think justifies moving it; &gt;!Obi Wan talks to anakin as though Satine is still alive!&lt;

[I] Some Legacy stuff that was brought out to conclude things after the shows ""cancellation"" in 2013.

[J] CO swaps these arcs around, while that is true chronologically, both arcs are separate and could be viewed in any order. But I think they were right in terms of pacing, story, character and tone to air them as they did, they feel much better this way.

[K] You could watch the 4.5 hour super cut of RotS here instead. I watched RotS between 710 and 711, and that is probably the best place to put it if you need to watch them together. But I wish I had just watched The Seige of Mandalore as its own thing uninterrupted with RotS afterward, as you carry forward with character development that's been building for 133 episodes before bookending the series with RotS.

[L] I put this here as well, as I think many people will be interested after finishing the series. The Audiobook is read out by Ashley Eckstein (Ahsoka's Voice Actress) which comes highly recommended.

[M] Some fun 2 minute shorts that are reminiscent of the 2003 Clone Wars Series. I found this order on Wikipedia and [here](https://starwarscanontimeline.com/tvshow/forces-destiny/). Technically, the first short on the list takes place around The Phantom Menace but it works here as well. I placed it within the series as in the UO.

54,I think going forward SW needs a fresh start. Stop playing it safe and actually be bold!,1593855830,"I like Star Wars, but I think it's time to stop relying on the original trilogy moving forward. Stop trying to relive what once as and actually go in a new direction. Here is thing and this maybe an unpopular opinion. But Let's end the skywalker saga completely. There honestly was no reason to continue it to begin with. The prequels and original trilogy told the entire story. There really was no reason to keep going with it.

I don't hate thew new films. I just think they are ok but they play it too safe, they offer nothing really new and just feel like Disney cared more about their bank accounts than actually telling a unique and  original story.

Take Rogue One and Solo. They are both OK films but at the same time they are nothing burgers. That don't really add anything new. They exist solely to play it safe and live off of nostalgia.

I might get downvoted but I hope moving forward Disney stops trying to rely on nostalgia to please fans, actually take a risk, and make an entire new story that doesn't rely on the old movies.

I like Vader and Luke just as much as the next fans. But their stories are done. We've seen the rise, the fall, and lived through the family drama. There is nothing more to really add.

We have seen through comics and novels (before being retconned) that a good Star Wars story can exist without the skywalkers being the main focus. Heck the old republic games showed you can make an interesting story set in the Star Wars universe that has nothing to do with the old movies.

So instead, create new heroes. Ones that have no relation with the old movies. New villains who can be more than just simply Vader clones and actually be their own character who stands out.",StarWars,ArmadilloHero,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hl0rhv/i_think_going_forward_sw_needs_a_fresh_start_stop/

64,Strong Minority and Female Characters (My Opinion),1593850325,"Hello Star Wars community. As everyone knows, our community is very divided right now. There are people who want Star Wars to be a simple, adventure/sci-fun series and those who want a very political and feminist message. I find myself in between. I love Star Wars. I can’t even remember the first time I’ve seen one. I grew up with them and adored them my whole life. Seeing the community like this pains me.
But I believe there’s a simple solution that would please both types of fans.
I want Star Wars to remain an adventure series and not a political outlet. But I also would love to see strong, WELL WRITTEN minorities and women.
Rey is a tough character in Star Wars right now. I think she’s cool and witty, but I agree with everyone who says she’s overpowered and did nothing to deserve her power. But she could have been amazing.
A big point I hear a lot is that, in Episode 7, Rey defeats Kylo Ren in a lightsaber duel with no lightsaber training. Yes, that was terrible. In my opinion, it would have been more satisfying to see her be defeated by Kylo (white male) and then see Rey train and then defeat Kylo later on.
The females in the sequel trilogy are made to look better, because the male characters are bad. Look at Poe in Episode 8. He was a jerk. And Finn was just really dumb. The men are being dumbed down to make the women look better and that’s not good.
Then I look at Leia. Wow. Leia is one of my top favorite characters in Star Wars. She’s just such a tough woman and I admire it. She saved Han Solo a couple times! And Han Solo is a strong character. He didn’t need to be dumbed down in order for Leia to be cooler than him. She just was.
I would love to see a strong, well written homosexual character in Star Wars. They would have a real arc and aren’t gay just because it’s a political message.

Here’s my problem with Star Wars and movies in general. Strong women and minorities and gay characters are made to make activists happy. And that simply shouldn’t be the case. Gay and minority characters should be able to take center stage and be accepted. They shouldn’t have to be hidden in the background or have a sexuality retcon (Lando) to make activists happy. There are many different kinds of people in this world, they should be able to be in media without having to ask to be represented.

So yes! Let’s have strong women, strong minorities and strong LQBTQ characters. But they should be in the story because society consists of all kinds of people. Not because a bunch of activists want representation. Star Wars has a whole galaxy that should be filled with different people! Let’s make that happen! Enough with “representation” let’s have minority characters a part of our Star Wars because there’s more than one kind of people in the galaxy.

It just the crew of the Ghost seems so much warmer than everything we saw in Clone Wars.  That and its one story not several stories. 

2) I love the way my all time favorite character, Darth Vader, is used.  Not too much, not too little, just right!  I greatly enjoyed seeing him kick serious Rebel butt in the opening episodes and all the scenes with him and Ahsoka in Twilight of the Apprentice were everything I could hope for.

3) Yes my favorite episode was the Honorable Ones when  Zeb and Agent Kallus were trapped together on an ice planet.  It reminded me of an old Superboy TV episode called  Mine Games where he and Lex Luthor were trapped in a cave together.

87,Psychological vs Sociological Storytelling in Star Wars,1593842056,"A YouTube channel I enjoy (JustWrite for anybody curious) made a video not long ago describing why the last seasons of Game of Thrones were so badly received, compared to the early seasons, and his basic reasoning was that the show had transitioned from “sociological” to “psychological” storytelling. Great video, but upon hearing this, I immediately thought of the Star Wars prequels and how he put into words what made me love the PT so much. 

Put briefly, psychological storytelling is the more widespread form of telling a story. Basically, you have a protagonist, something bad happens to then, and then they overcome the bad thing. Pretty oversimplified but you get the gist; it’s overcoming some hardship or challenge that changes you when you come out the other end, i.e the OT (and also the ST.) On the other hand, sociological storytelling deals more with a society or social/political structure. It involves with issues that might plague a civilization, rather than an individual, and how many different events can be interconnected for many different types of characters, i.e the PT. 

Ok, so what? Well, while I was hearing this YouTuber’s points, I immediately thought back to the RedLetterMedia video for the Phantom Menace, specially the part where he talks about “The Hero’s Journey” and how a story “needs” a protagonist and how TPM doesn’t have one and is somehow worse for it. Even back then, before I knew all these fancy terms, I knew that it was a disingenuous way to discredit the prequels. As if following the original Star Wars format is the only way to make a good film (*cough TFA.) Does this absolve the Prequels of any criticism? No, of course not. But I’m sure there are many here who grew up with the prequels, while also watching the OT, and preferring the PT, not because it was “shinier” but because the world-building, the Jedi/Sith structures, the nature of the force, the inter-galactic turmoil, the conspiracies etc. were all more fascinating to us than some farm boy who goes on an adventure to save a princess (don’t @ me, I love all SW I swear!) 

Now, you may say the PT isn’t sociological storytelling and that it’s really about Anakin/Darth Vader. I don’t know what the “rules” are here, but I imagine you can mix and match right? Like hell, just look at that bible. Who’s the main hero of that whole story? Basically, the point that I’m trying to make is that there was a decision for the PT to be more about the “Star Wars Universe” rather than any one hero. And if you consider that to be the main character, then by all accounts the PT succeeded, due to how many elements it established in the overall Star Wars lore. 

TL;DR: The PT is a different type of story than the OT, and that’s what made it interesting.",StarWars,TheRedCap,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hkye31/psychological_vs_sociological_storytelling_in/

It also does so well in giving us the message to never just follow because thats what your told and for kids that such a good message that doesn't always get told, yes kids shows tell you to be individual and maybe now a days they are more cartoons where the villain in some episodes are police or someone in power, but even then its not that common of a message,  there's a clone called Dogma ffs, it focuses on him and his path and disillusionment with the Generals.

2. Why did Ochi have a dagger with the coordinates to the Wayfinder to bring Rey to Exogol, when Palpatine could have just given him the directions himself when he ordered Ochi to kidnap Rey and bring her to him?

3. When Luke was searching for the dagger with Lando, was this before his self-exile on Ahch-To after “a student (aka his nephew) turned on him”? Or was this a retcon of TLJ?

4. How did Lando get such a massive amount of pilots together at the end so quickly (assuming this is taking place over a day or two), when no one came when Leia and the Resistance sent the distress signal on Crait in TLJ?

66,"Is it just me, or were some of the blaster sound effects different in the Sequel Trilogy?",1593818995,"Look, I know any of the following stuff doesn't affect the story at all, so I'm just being nitpicky. I'm not here to be salty, I'm just pointing out something I found a bit odd.  It may not matter to most fans, but it matters to me (I'm weird, ok?).

You see, apart from the TIE fighter blaster sound effect, and Han's signature blaster sound effect, almost none of the blaster sound effects from the previous six movies are in Episodes 7-8-9. They're there in *Rogue One*, *Solo*, and *The Mandalorian*, but not in the sequels. Let me give you some examples:

Turbolaser cannons have a very distinctive sound to them. This sound has been around since the original 1977 film, and yet none of the First Order's Star Destroyers use the same sound. A possible in-universe explanation could be because the First Order developed a more powerful turbolaser cannon, which happens to have a different noise. But I think it's a bit of an odd choice to exclude it, as I have ALWAYS heard the turbolaser SFX used for capital ships in videogames, commercials, even the animated shows. It's almost as iconic as the lightsaber ignition sound.

The Millennium Falcon's quad laser cannons have a distinctive sound to them as well. We only hear them during the TIE fighter chase scene in *Hope* and briefly during the Battle of Endor in *Jedi*, but the sound effect is different in the sequel trilogy. This was most apparent during the scene in TFA where Finn and Rey fly through the Jakku junkyards. Of course, the in-universe reason just could be because Han replaced the quad cannons sometime after J*edi*, but there's no reason for us as the audience to think that. It's just a little unusual how after having the Falcon show up on screen for the first time in 30 years, that the cannons sound different. What makes this even more bizarre, is that in *Solo,* we see the Falcon fire its guns during the Kessel Run chase, and the sound effect used there is the same one from the Original Trilogy! I don't get why the SFX teams were so selective.

Furthermore, X-wings also have a distinctive blaster sound to them. It's a little hard to pick up considering how little we see X-wings actually do any dogfighting in the Original Trilogy (Trench Runs don't count as dogfights). They used the same sound effects in *Rebels,* and in Battlefront II (as well as every other piece of Star Wars content involving X-wings), so I don't know why they suddenly vanished.

In *The Last Jedi,* there's a scene where Kylo Ren orders his army of AT-M6 walkers to fire on Astral!Luke Skywalker, and while that scene is pretty darn cool, the cannons don't sound like any of the walker cannon's we've heard throughout the rest of the Star Wars universe. I'm fine with them changing things, I'm just not sure why they changed the cannon effects. It would have been a nice nod to *Empire* to have the successors to the AT-ATs sound like AT-AT's but more powerful. What makes this stranger, is that in *Rogue One*, during the Battle of Scarif we see AT-ATs (technically T-ACTs, but whatever), and they use the classic sound effect. (To be fair, they did reuse the sound effect in *The Last Jedi* during the Finn/Phasma fight, where BB-8 hijacks a First Order AT-ST.)

Overall, in the sequel trilogy blasters tend to have a generic ""pew pew"" sound to them. If I'm being honest, I remember watching The Force Awakens and thinking that the Stormtroopers' guns sounded like the phasers from the Star Trek Reboots, and not like the blasters from Star Wars. I know I'm being pedantic here, but there was something a bit off about the way they sounded. I think if I had listened to the shooutout scenes while blindfolded, I would never have been able to tell that a Star Wars movie was playing. I would have just thought it was some sci-fi movie.",StarWars,steamtrekker,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hktaqt/is_it_just_me_or_were_some_of_the_blaster_sound/

85,Padme is Anakin's mother figure/wife let me explain.,1593813269,"Padme is like Anakins new mommy figuratively because Anakin has BIG 'mommy' issues and definitely transfers them onto Padme. Not only does she *look* like Shmi, but Anakin himself draws an overt parallel between them through his visions and compulsive need to save them.

IMO, the absolute crux of Anakin's psychological state is rooted in him prematurely leaving his mother. It's a disastrous move - the Anakin we see in TPM is a healthy-minded, kind little boy. The Anakin we see in AOTC is petulant, aggressive and possessive. Without a parental figure to love and support him, he hasn't matured past childlike emotional impulses; coupled with that, he has a simultaneous guilt for leaving his mother and a fear of abandonment himself.

Enter Padme, a woman who looks exactly like Shmi and who Anakin has thought of 'every day' since he met her, i.e. since he left his mother, effectively transferring his affections. She's older, she's nurturing and he marries her RIGHT AFTER his mother dies. There's even an interesting line where Anakin says 'he'd much rather dream about Padme' over his mother. The two are inextricably linked in his mind, only Padme is his second, brighter chance at cultivating what he sees as a successful family unit.

At the end of AOTC, Anakin has not healed psychologically from the loss of his mother (not just her death, but more broadly from leaving her as a child). As a result, he's consumed by an intense fear of losing the woman who has taken her place - his wife. His conflation of these two women is what leads to his fatal error in ROTS, i.e. turning to Palpatine to try and save Padme from his mother's fate. Therefore, I'd go as far as to say the tragedy of the PT begins way back in TPM, when the Jedi misguidedly remove a vulnerable child from his mother to catastrophic ends.",StarWars,MilfLover-98,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hkrrr2/padme_is_anakins_mother_figurewife_let_me_explain/

And Anikin says ""I thought I already did""

Obi Wan ""only in your mind my very young apprentice ""

This bit of dialog tells us a lot. That Obi Wan knows how strong Master Yoda is with a LS. And that Anikin doesn't view Yoda as a worthy opponent, either that, or that Yoda hides his true strength. Or both as the latter affects the former. Obi Wan also knows Anikin isn't strong enough to duel Yoda. 

Then later in the scene with Padme, Anikin says ""Obi Wan is wise like Master Yoda. And powerful like Master Windu.""

Again we see that Anikin doesn't view Master Yoda as a strong swordsman. Perhaps during training, Windu doesn't hold back like Master Yoda does. Either that, or Anikin is fooled by Yoda's size and age.

I noticed Anikin was passed out through the whole fight scene with Yoda, meaning he still would not know how strong he is.

66,"Across canon or legends, did a Jedi ever have an opportunity to speak to a clone trooper following Order 66?",1593794996,"With Order 66, normally the clones were depicted as ""flipping a switch"" and gunning down the Jedi. Any dialogue between a Jedi and clone in these circumstances devolved into meaningless combat speech. **I often wonder if the clones would question themselves if they were forced into a discussion with the ones they were hunting, since canon suggests that they were unwillingly forced into the behavior by brain implants.**


**Was there any point (in legends or canon) in which either..**

**1. A clone was captured and disarmed by a Jedi**

Or

**2. A jedi was captured and disarmed by clones**

**In which the two had any meaningful discussion?**


Im imagining a general turning against a befriended jedi (similiar to Cody vs Obi Wan) in which the jedi captured the clone and demanded answers for their behavior.

Well long story short, Holy Crap! I feel so bad for waiting this long, but the series is amazing. It was fun and adventurous and I could not stop watching them. Even watching the older episodes, I was a little but skeptical, but they turned out to be my favorites.

22,Phantom menace could have been skipped,1593777097,"Okay so let me start this by saying ROTS is my favourite star wars movie, it just invokes emotions in me that none of the others do (for example, i always wish until the last second before it happens that anakin doesn’t turn). And i like phantom menace, AOTC is a little boring but has some cool and good moments (like the assasin chase, the music is so good)! I just think it would have been better if they started the first movie with anakin being a padawan.

 Reference the fact that he was adopted by the jedi order too old via dialogue and show that he is more emotional and impulsive than the other jedi. 

The mom dying- plot could be about the same but maybe a bit more struggling with his orders not to do anything about it but ultimately deciding to go save his mother. 

The romance plot - uhhh just do it better. Better dialogue, the crush works better if anakin and padme meet when anakin is maybe 14 and padme is like 16.
Maybe during a mission of obi-wan and his padawan anakin going on a mission to protect the queen of naboo, padme. Bits of this could be shown trough flashbacks. Or padme and anakin could talk about it.
 Show that they have a bond right away.

 Maybe something like they are remembering the last time they saw eachother, talking about it, laughing etc. and then “i missed you” “i thought jedi weren’t allowed to have attachments? “ anakin smiling “we aren’t” padme smiling “i missed you too”. Yeah a bit cheesy, corny whatever still better than “so have you.. grown more beautiful i mean” 

Then the second movie could focus on the clone wars and anakins disillusionment for the jedi order, show anakin disregarding rules to save everyone to make his turn even more tragic. 

Because i mean the broad strokes are good, i just think the execution could’ve been way better. And it would’ve given more time to develop anakin &amp; padme, obi-wan &amp; anakin, jedi-order &amp; anakin if they skipped phantom menace. I mean anakin &amp; obi-wan interact maybe 2 seconds in phantom menace.

Oh and, i really like hayden as anakin, especially in ROTS, don't @ me. 

And i’m sorry i can’t write for shit lol, just some thoughts i had.

So the only logical answer is to just sit back and enjoy the movies and let others do whatever they like.

To anyone else who wants to defend the sequels, please stop. It’s not helping anyone and is just convincing people that they are under attack. So just enjoy the movies and if anyone says they are just bad or insult you for liking them. Don’t respond, it’s what feeds them. It’s a confirmation bias for them.

And for people who dislike the movies, that’s cool. Just don’t be mean about it.

I have a speculation that Korkie Kryze was really the son of Satine_Kryze .

Satine and Obi-Wan did have romantic relationship when they were younger, which was about 12 to 15 years before The clone wars .

After Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon left, Satine discovered she was with child. She realized the potential scandal that an abortion would cause. She also didn't want Obi-Wan to get in trouble with the JediOrder .

So she had the child in secret and had a trusted relative raise him as there own. This would also make sense as Korkie's age during clone wars can be between 12 to 15.
 adoptive mother name is also not mentioned as it is not required. Both Korkie and Sarine even seem to have similar features like blonde hair etc. Obi-Wan was not aware of this child till after the clone wars and Obi-Wan  series Could have a plot on Obi-Wan  having to make the choice between protecting Luke are going after his own son.

81,A criticism of Battlefront 2 and a hope for a Battlefront 3.,1593750508,"Having played battlefront 2 on and off since launch, it has gone from a broken, buggy and unfair mess, to a quality game just missing something important. On a surface level it gives a sense of scale that upon first glance seems impressive, but after more time it kind of breaks down. You can see the missed potential of the game. It has four infantry classes but each only five weapons and a limiting and intrusive star card system. There are very detailed and well animated vehicles, but they seem limited by small narrow and cluttered maps, that make maneuvering a chore. Starfighters look and sound fantastic but are hindered by controls that seem like they’re trying to fight against you. 

Infantry combat, at its core is well balanced but is shallow and dependent of weapon bloom and accuracy penalties to balance weapons. The weapons themselves, again look and sound fantastic, but only are only capable of the most basic customization. The default faction specific weapons don’t even allow customization. 

The battlepoint system is good but boils down to people sitting at menu waiting for the chance to play as a hero to top the leaderboard. I think for non hero and non vehicle reinforcements, the battlepoint system works well. But vehicles should spawn at a base out of harm at the begining of the match so that those who like the vehicle combat can just play that. For heros, I believe they should be doled out randomly with a yes or no option like in the 2005 battlefront, and also be on a cooldown so that once you finally kill a hero they dont just respawn immediately just to chain battlepoint for the entire match.

Star cards unfortunately seem like leftovers mechanisms for the abandoned micro-transaction system, and do little to vary the gameplay because of the lack of freedom. Each class has several passive cards and several ability cards, but due to slot restrictions you always see more or less the same class loadouts.

Vehicles themselves are quite powerful, but are hindered by most maps that feature them. But the biggest issue with vehicles is the constant stuttering I experience when i drive almost every ground vehicle. Also being extremely susceptible to standard infantry fire, there is no reason to use something like the ion torpedo or  a rocket launcher. 

It seems a waste to know that there are dozens of battles and characters showcased in the Clone Wars tv show that remain on so many peoples’ wish list and never see the light of day. So many people including myself would have LOVED to see Ashoka in battlefront 2, even having voice line from Grevious talking about her and padme. Maps we see in the show like christophsis, ryloth, rishi, cato neimoidia, mon cala, umbara, utapau, mygeto, corusant, and lets not forget the siege of mandalore, would all be welcomed additions as well as the numerous characters.

It was said that Dice wanted battlefront to be different from the battlefield series. Overall they have succeeded. Battlefield is a revered franchise that has produced some of the best shooters of all time and EA’s battlefron series profuced a forgettable first installment and a barely salvaged controversial sequel. In the future dice should not shy away from making battlefront like battlefield. Battlefields 3 and 4 have some of the best vehicle, aircraft and infantry design of the arcade shooter genre.   

I want a battlefront game with the same formula of the best battlefield games, like bf3 and bf4 and bf1. Big maps that encourage massive vehicle combat, and that possess the sense of scale that battlefront 2 lacks. Dice is capable of making 32v32 gamemodes, and there is no reason I can see for them not implementing it. The addition of multi-seat vehicles is a must for the battlefront franchise, and was even present in the old 2004 and 2005 games. This would transform vehicles like the LAAT from a difficult on rails minigame into an air to ground menace that would greatly expand on the ground to air interactions. This would also diversify tank combat by keeping fights from devolving into spamming siege mode at one another to a dynamic pursuit between the two opponents requiring actual strategy skill. Also adding the following features would make a new game far more replayable: conquest as a default mode, weather (which we see on geonosis on galactic assault), rental servers like the battlefield franchise, the use and implementation of the vast amount of clone wars content, a fleshed out offline instant action mode, flight controls mirrored from battlefield 3 or 4.

But anyways, thats the longest thing I’ve written in a while and I think it needs to be said, that the current state of battlefront 2 is very good, considering how most of its life cycle was spent repairing the game and its progression. I think if dice wasn’t rushed to launch by EA, and had enough time to get the game ready, we would have seen much more content.

Why not just manually make the jump for a split second and put distance between them and the imperial cruiser?

If it’s a choice between losing a deflector shield and taking fire, why not just engage it for a brief moment and then manually disengage it after less than a second? It’s apparently “canon” for now that it can be done, and IN that exact ship nonetheless.

There is no remote possibility at a single second at lightspeed they would be able to make it to even one of the “suns” around Tatooine (and even then simply point the bow of the ship AWAY from the damn suns) nonetheless a random star off in the distance AND it would be more than long enough to be out of visual range of the cruiser at “lightspeed”",StarWars,KalynnCampbell,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hkbzwi/why_didnt_han_lightspeed_jump/

Through meditation and by channeling a calm state of focus similar to the Jedi, he exhibits a connection to a spiritual force within himself, which grants him enhanced, supernatural abilities.

Ryu’s journey focuses on maintaining a peaceful balance with the force inside him and not yielding to the seduction of anger and rage as a shortcut to unlocking more brutal powers at this cost of his humanity, similar to the temptation of the dark side. He is regularly shown to exhibit compassion for his opponents, only seeking to learn from the battle, not revel in the violence and victory.

Darth Hush: This Sith Lord wears a tightly fit black armor and faceless helmet with red lenses for the eyes. She wields a red lightsaber that has a detachable laser rifle fueled by her sabers kyber crystal, this causes a massive explosion every time she fires. She uses a form 2 lightsaber combat style but prefers to end her enemies from a range. She cannot use force lighting, despite her vigorous training... she can’t use her hate to fire lighting at her enemies. However, she makes up for this with her technique: Most Star Wars battles have the two dueling over some kind of precarious fall, jumping from platform to platform, instead of letting the Jedi fall to get ready for the fight, she just kind of nudges them to the side a little, causing them to fall to their deaths.

She uses a form 2 lightsaber combat style but prefers to end her enemies from a range. She cannot use force lighting, despite her vigorous training... she can’t use her hate to fire lighting at her enemies. However, she makes up for this with her technique: Most Star Wars battles have the two dueling over some kind of precarious fall, jumping from platform to platform, instead of letting the Jedi fall to get ready for the fight, she just kind of nudges them to the side a little, causing them to fall to their deaths. Darth Hush rarely ever speaks during a fight, she has in fact never spoken to her master, but when you do hear her voice... it’s safe to say she doesn’t plan on you living much longer.

72,Star Wars: Movie III Alt Ending,1593727891,"Disclaimer: It has some holes (where some Sith and Jedi went, how some systems got captured) but I did this as a rough draft for a much bigger idea.

&amp;#x200B;

Basic idea: Rumors about Chancellor Palpatine were running rampant among the Jedi Order. It was believed that Palpatine was taking advantage of Anakin’s trust, but how he was doing it was unknown.. Meanwhile, on Kamino, Lama-Su sent Obi-Wan-Kenobi an emergency holo-message, requesting that he come to Kamino, as he has some startling news. Obi-Wan, obeying this, set off to the elusive cloning facility. Concurrently, the Confederacy of Independent Systems won many decisive battles on Kashyyyk, Mygeeto, and Felucia, forcing the clones out of those systems, falling back to Couroscant and other strong Republic holdouts. Obi-Wan, arriving on Kamino, was ushered inside. Lama-Su, clearly distressed, showed Obi-Wan a holo message from the Chancellor himself, asking Taun-We to begin the control device programming. The control devices, originally being used to force the clones to obey orders, now had a much more sadistic cause. Obi-Wan held an emergency meeting with the Jedi Order to go over possible actions they could take in regard to the Chancellor. It was decided that Mace Windu, Ki-Adi-Mundi, Kit Fisto, and Obi-Wan-Kenobi to be his personal guards in case of an attack or assassination attempt. They assigned an ""army"" of 2-1B medical droids to begin removing the control chips. In the meantime, the Sepratists began to gain air superiority with the new Advanced Vulture Droid and the Hyena Bomber. The new Vulture Droids were able to hold off the ARC-170s and the Y-Wing bombers, as the Hyena Bombers began attack runs on the Republic capital ships. Although the medical droids were working as fast as possible, they weren't able to get as many clones through as needed, however, they were able to get the Couroscant guards and major legions of clones like the 501st Legion and 327th Star Corps. Obi-Wan, getting the word from the head of the medical droids stationed at Kamino, that they had just finished with the 327th. The Chancellors guard of Jedi got the word from Captain Rex (CT-7567) that the Chancellor had just executed Order 66, and the Jedi were now able to proceed with Order 65. Order 65 started that ""If either a majority of the Galactic Senate or the Republic Security Council deemed the Supreme Chancellor unfit for duty, and if the clone forces directly received Order 65, then the army was to immediately arrest or, if needed, kill the Chancellor. Following this, command of the Grand Army would be given to the acting Chancellor until a stable replacement could be chosen.""  The Chancellors guard of Jedi, broke into the Chancellors office, declared that Order 65 was in progress as decided by an emergency meeting by the Senate, and that Chancellor Palpatine was under arrest. Palpatine, seeing that he was outmatched, jumped out of the window overlooking the city, and a chase ensued from the 501st and Anakin Skywalker as he fled into the lower sectors of Couroscant, to never be seen again. After the Palpatine’s dissapearance, the CIS navy began their assault on the Republic holdouts in the galaxy. The CIS, using their new Advanced Vulture Droids, and Advanced Hyena Bombers, started an assault on Kuat Drive Yards, the Republics lifeline for starships, and simultaneously assaulting its subsidiary, Rothana Heavy Engineering. A very lengthy battle ensued for control over Kuat Drive Yards, resulting in hundreds of thousands of casualties on each side. Kuat and Rothana are eventually captured by the CIS and those too become factories for the war machine that is the CIS. The leader of this, STV-06, a super tactical droid, authorized the building of a new kind of war vessel, the Advanced Lucrehulk.  The Advanced Lucrehulk reeks havoc upon the rebel fleets and begins it’s orbital bombardments of the last Republic planet in the galaxy, Couroscant. STV-06 shells Couroscant for weeks and he lands thousands of the new Advanced B1-Battle Droids on the planet to engage in the brutal building to building fighting. It takes only a matter of days for the CIS to take control of most of Couroscant and to be on the steps of the Jedi Temple. A large scale battle takes place between the Jedi alongside the 501st and the CIS. By this time the 327th Star Corps begins their attack on the blockade surrounding the planet, but it is far too late. The 327th’s attacks are futile against the heavily improved CIS starships. In the end, the citizens on Couroscant were executed or imprisoned, the Kaminoan cloning facilities were destroyed, and the Jedi fall. The few who survived are captured and tortured by the CIS for information about other Republic holdouts.

47,Star Wars movie fan wanting to branch out...need some advice on what to watch and where to start..,1593713922,"I've been a huge huge fan of the star wars movies my whole life. I never really branched out beyond the movies tho. I guess the main reason why is because it was and still is so much.

&amp;#x200B;

Between the movies, the books, the games, the comics...just everything. I honestly had no clue where to start or what order to do anything in.

&amp;#x200B;

I saw my first star wars movie when i was just a kid, the first one i ever saw i saw in the theater, i'll never forget it...it was Return of The Jedi...just recently (well a few months ago) i took my own kid to see Rise of Skywalker...and i dunno, it was just magical....it really was....the circle was now complete....my mom took me as a kid to see my first ever star wars movie, and then me, as an adult, took my own kid to see the final installment of the Skywalker Saga....and it reignited my love and passion for star wars...

&amp;#x200B;

And that brings us to now....i've actually branched out from just the movies....I was talking to a friend at work and he told me about a Vader comic series that took place right after Ep 3, so i read all those...

&amp;#x200B;

I watched The Mandolorian...i'll be honest, i thought it was going to be stupid....boy was i WRONG!!! I can't wait for season 2.

&amp;#x200B;

So now I'm asking my fellow star wars fans, what should be next on my list? We have Disney +, so whatever is on there I have access to. I've heard about The Clone Wars and Rebels and Resistance. Which one of those should I watch, and in what order?

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice would be helpful as i try to broaden the scope of my star wars fandom and universe.

&amp;#x200B;

49,Ahsoka during the OT period,1593713289,"""Ultimately, when it comes down to it, as the storyteller you have to tell a story that you like and hope other people like it too."" - Dave Filoni

Everyone has their own theories about what our favorite Togruta was up to during the OT. Since we've been given no information (yet), I decided I would write my own story of what I imagine she could've been doing, at least during some of the time period. But unlike other fan-fiction about her...the story is not told from her perspective, nor is she the main character (although she is central to the storyline itself).

Here's the [link](https://archiveofourown.org/works/24705529/chapters/59713087) if you'd like to check it out. It has some direct crossover with the events of ANH, as well as a few Rebels characters in it. I really enjoyed writing it, and I hope you enjoy reading it!

51,"Okay, Luke was definitely Rey's father--here's the evidence I have",1593713014,"So there was an obvious connection between Rey and Luke's saber from the VERY FIRST MOVIE. This is key. Who else has a connection to that saber? Anakin, of course, Luke's father. So saber connection is correlated to family relation. This is undisputable. Multiple examples in SW and Legends support this.

Now remember when Rey says to Han, I've never seen so much green before, when they're flying over Takodana. This is a peculiar line. It's because Rey has only been on Jakku before. But in TLJ she mentions how she wasn't always on that planet. So what other planet was she on before Jakku? It can't be a green planet. Tatooine? This supports the theory that Luke raised a family on his home planet.

Also keep in mind that when Luke says the word father when talking about Vader to Rey he has a slight smirk and a sort of twinkle in his eye. I know for a fact that this was likely scripted. The director and Hammil both knew this was a little nod towards his parentage of Rey. 

Another key piece of evidence is that Kylo and Rey have an obvious force connection. Similar to the Leia, Vader, and Luke connection from the OT, being able to talk to each other from distances. This is an undisputable connection facilitated by family relation. Rey is Kylo's cousin.

So what about the whole Palpatine grandfather theory? It is so obvious, and I can't believe others don't think so, it was a lie from Kylo. He already lied to Rey about her parents smoking and drinking for gambling money. Kylo partly is motivated by the fact that he doesn't want Rey to be the rightful owner of Luke's saber. He lies to her so he can be the rightful owner--remember in TFA when he yells at her that the saber belongs to him? Also, and I know this is weird, he has feelings for Rey, and is afraid that if he reveals her true parentage she'll be disgusted about being in a relationship with him.

This may not be true but I could have sworn there was a deleted scene from TLJ where Luke says to Yoda, I love that girl like a daughter. I can't find it anywhere though, but I thought it existed.

70,The Sequel Trilogy needs it's own Prequel and Sequel trilogies,1593709249,"Instead of trying to de-canonize the sequel trilogy, Disney needs to double or triple down on it. I think the reason why the Sequel trilogy was not well received, was that too much time had passed. There wasn't enough of a connection between the two trilogies. We need a prequel trilogy to show us what happened in between. We need to see the Republic being rebuilt. We need to see the rise of Snoke and the First Order. We need to see the Emperor survive the Death Star and escape to Exogul where he plots out his return. We need to see Han and Leia raising Ben and see his fall at Luke's Jedi training academy. Seeing all of that would make the sequel trilogy have so much more meaning. I know the original actors are either no longer with us or are too old for these roles, so all they need to do is recast them or use deep faje technology. 

Finally, we need a sequel trilogy to the sequel trilogy, or else we're just going to end up in the same boat as the Original Trilogy. Both trilogies showed the rise of powerful heroes (Luke and Rey) but so far has failed to pay either off. We need a post-sequel trilogy sequel trilogy to show Rey as a full fledged Jedi. We need to see her take on a new threat, on her own accord, without help or training from anybody else. Showing her really come into her own will make her much more accepted by the fans.

36,Can star wars fans just not be happy for other people anymore,1593694326,"I've been hearing the rumour that Disney wants to decanonise the Sequel Trilogy alot recently. Firstly, its blatant bullshit. Why would they decanonise 3 billion dollar movies. Not to mention galaxys edge. A theme park solidly set in the Sequel Trilogy, they would need to renovate the entire park to change to another era.

But back to the main point. I remember when the EU was decanonised. I remember how hurt everyone was and now I see these same people advocating for the Sequels to be wiped from canon and I have to ask. Do you not feel empathy anymore. Why would you want another fans favorite star wars thing to no longer be canon. 

People who advocate for this are just sad. It is literally the ""If I can't have it then no one can"" mentality.

49,I've just realized that the sequels cancel everything done in the OT.,1593690667,"Sorry if I'm late to the discussion and if that has been already discussed, I only seen TROS recently. Basically, what the title say, everything accomplished in the OT is either destroyed, canceled or made irrelevant by the sequels.

*at galactic level*

*the new republic is destroyed
* the empire is back, first re-branded as the first order, then back again as the actual empire. 

* the rebels are re-branded as the resistance, then destroyed, then back again

* the death stars and their destructions are made irrelevant by the Starkiller Base.



*at the force level*

*Luke inheriting the Jedi is canceled by him getting all his students killed, destroying the jedi text and dying without making Rey a Jedi.

*the emperor is back and in fact was never really gone.

*the redemption of anakin/vader is somewhat made irrelevant , both by the return of the emperor and the fact that his Sith legacy influenced his grandson to the dark side. 



*at character level*

*luke can't transmit the jedi heritage and lose the hope that characterize him.

*Han et Leia are not together anymore.

*Han, who had grow as a leader in ESB is back to being a smuggler.


to be clear, I'm not arguing against any of these changes at the individual level but when you take them as a whole, they make the OT mostly irrelevant and pointless which I find pretty disheartening.",StarWars,nobb,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hjvle7/ive_just_realized_that_the_sequels_cancel/

94,Does Star Wars break the laws of space?,1593672921,"So I was going on a star wars movie spree, and I noticed a few things about the space logic. 

1. Sound can be heard in space.

Whenever there is a blaster sound or a spaceship flying in space, the sound of it can be heard. The problem is, sound can't travel through the empty vacuum of space. You'll understand that if you payed attention in class. You shouldn't be able to hear sound in space. 

But alas, I understand that it would be a very quiet movie if there was no sound in 3/4 of the whole movie...

2. Newton's first law (I think)

""An object at rest stays at rest, an object in motion stays in motion""

There is no gravity or friction in space, so when a ship runs out of fuel, it should not stop and start dipping downwards. Even if they ran out of fuel, they should be able to go on full speed, as there is nothing in space to slow down the ship. But no..... It comes to a friggin stop somehow and starts dipping downwards...

Which also brings in the question, how do they so easily come to a stop so easily after entering hyperspace? That seems rather impossible if you look at it.

You could say that they have advanced tech, but I don't think that's enough to put a ship going at lightspeed to an almost complete stop.

Just a thought....

Then he tells Kylo to execute Rey and that scene happens exactly as it happened in the film. Then when Kylo gives her his speech, feeling like no one else values her and that Luke rejected her, Rey turns to the darkside and sides with Kylo. It would actually do something interesting with Rey's character and be something that hasn't been done before.

After that, Finn could arrive on Ahch-To desperate to find Rey, and  Luke, sensing both the force in Finn and Rey's fall, agrees to train him to try and avoid the same thing happening. 

Rey wouldn't need to be seriously injured in the fight with Kylo but maybe just enough that she can't accompany him to Crait and that could happen as normal only at the end we could see a flustered Kylo return and tell Rey that they are setting course for Korriban immediately so they can both realize their true potential.",StarWars,lostinthebardo,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hjngk6/just_one_part_of_tlj_i_would_rewrite/

60,Do we know anything about the deleted scenes from Rise Of Skywalker? (They weren't on the DVD),1593650657,"Hiya.

Simple question... Does anyone know anything about the deleted scenes from the last Star Wars film? Not a single one has been released, and I'm pretty curious about this stuff that we're not seeing.

Spoilers ahead, if any of you haven't seen TROS yet...

I heard there was supposed to be a scene with ""The Oracle"" AKA ""The Eye Of Webbish Bog"", which was eventually in the novel ([concept art](https://i.imgur.com/sJgshdz.png), [fully-built model visible in a behind-the-scenes feature at one point](https://i.imgur.com/iB9UWAU.png), [alleged set photo](https://i.imgur.com/UjiTV0t.png); apparently a special effects guy at one point said that this scene was fully shot), there were more Leia scenes, a Lando subplot involving Jannah being his daughter or something, at one point Matt Smith was apparently supposed to play a younger/rejuvinated Palpatine (may or may not have actually been shot?), the movie was at one point apparently supposed to open with a scene of Luke training Leia in the ROTJ era, rather than that scene going towards the end...

And apparently John Williams composed tons of score that went unused; IIRC rumours suggest there was an arrangement of Duel Of The Fates intended to be used at one point?...

Is there someone who's a bit more filled-in who can help me out here? The suggestions and whispers of this stuff I've heard sound cool, and I'm really curious to hear more.",StarWars,Robo4900,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hjn0sf/do_we_know_anything_about_the_deleted_scenes_from/

I loved the movie. In fact, I enjoyed it so much that I timed the infamous Vader scene, so that I could walk into different showtimes and watch audiences react to the sequence. 

So it's Sunday morning on opening weekend, and every showtime is packed. I stepped into a theater just about a minute or 2 before red saber ignition, and I notice a father rushing his young daughter out the theater, and to the restroom I assume.

He's gone, the scene starts, the audience is cheering and freaking out. 
Then just as the scene ended, the dad and daughter returned only to see Vader turn off his saber, with the audience still cheering.

Poor guy looked so heartbroken, as he slowly walked up the theater stairs carrying his daughter back to the seat, knowing he missed something great.",StarWars,HighThoughtBot,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hjmwme/a_quick_story_about_rogue_one/

I will have to remember to point out that the Jedi mission may not be secret to someone without telling them who and spoiling it when I do a saga marathon with another casual fan. 

Me and a buddy watched eight Episodes last year and mostly laughed at the droids. Good times.

Rian Johnson tweeting about the prequels will hopefully renew interest in The Phantom Menace. 

My own interest was renewed when I watched Episode I for July 1st today. (I will watch Episode II on July 2nd, Episode III on the 3rd, original STAR WARS on July 4th....should be some good fireworks!)

Even on my *n*th viewing of Episode I, I noticed how brilliant was the machinations of Palpatine with Padme. He knows that Padme holds the position ""I will not condone a course of action that will lead us to war."" and he knows that she just told him ""we must do something"" about what is happening to her people on Naboo. So he put her in a position when he said, ""To be realistic, your Majesty. I think we are going to have to accept Federation control for the time being.""

With these rumors around, whether they're true or not. I want to hear what some people have to say about the sequel trilogy being removed overall and then rebooted.

&amp;#x200B;

There would just be too many problems real world, and in canon for this to ever be pulled off correctly. There are so many inconsistencies we'd run into in a situation where the sequel trilogy would be remade, too many for anyones liking. 

We already have made characters and there story lines, if they had any hope to bring some of the cast members back (which I doubt could happen) they'd have to get new contracts which I don't think many of them would sign. Especially Mark Hamil and Harrison Ford. I don't think they'd ever come back and making it without them would be more catastrophic then we already have it. 

Not to mention these characters like Kylo Ren and Rey are solidified in our world as pop culture characters. Changing them up would feel so forced and historically wrong when looking back at it. 

Not to say again that we aren't even sure if they can pull off good movies anymore! Even with George Lucas possibly returning, he still is the infamous creator of Episode 1 and 2! Not great movies, so we dont want to see a repeat of that in another movie, imagine if Disney messed up twice to make good movies.

50,Could future Star Wars be done in animation?,1593614377,"Traditionally, big blockbuster franchises such as Star Wars, Marvel, DC, F&amp;F, James Bond and such, have always had their main movies made in live action, with supplementary shows often made in animation. There are probably great many reasons to why cinema has evolved itself in such direction, and to why animation is not more prominent in franchises. 

Clone Wars S7 the Siege of Mandalore was imo the best animation I have seen in all of Star Wars. For me, the cinematic experience was reaching a level of not only greatness within animation standards themselves, but on par with live action. The quality of animation, editing, music, acting, details and such were achieving an atmosphere that I would gladly compare to modern blockbuster live action movies. *It felt like a movie*, I often read on the internet. 

With time, this made me think whether the future of Star Wars, its next great stories, could abandon the traditional live action format, and be made in animation instead. I can think of several reasons to why this would be fitting:

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Animation team:**      Lucasfilm has probably the best team for the task. After working on CW      over 10 years and Rebels over 5 years, with the most competent SW      storyteller at the front; Dave Filoni, there is great talent within the      studio to produce animated Star Wars for the big screen. The Siege of      Mandalore was a proof of that. Additionally, as of now, they are not      working on any projects known to the public. 
2. **Fans:**      One challenge I can imagine would be to convince the general public, the      casual movie goers of Star Wars films now being animated. This could      initially mean less attention in the general media for the films/series,      but I believe that Star Wars has large enough of a hardcore fanbase to      pull through the initial phase so that the general fans gradually regain      interest. Additionally, most of the hardcore fanbase watches CW and Rebels      to know that animated Star Wars at its best is on par with the movies (you      guys can disagree in the comments). 
3. **Ahsoka**:      After the popularity of CW, one of the hottest characters to tell further      stories around is Ahsoka Tano. Already, we are seeing heavy rumors of her      appearing in Mando S2, and possibly getting her own live action show. A      popular concern is whether Ahsoka will translate well into live action, as      the character's look and movements heavily stem from the stylized animated      series. This problem could be swiftly avoided if it was the format for      ""Big Star Wars"" that changed from live action to animation.      Thus, Lucasfilm could easily tell new stories around a character that is      both well set up story-wise and popular amongst fans. 
4. **Hiatus:** In      2020 Lucasfilm finds itself in a sort of hiatus. The initially planned      sequels and standalone movies are finished. Only the Mandalorian is      currently being produced and released. Lucasfilm are now probably planning      the nearest future of SW movies. Maybe changes in the staff will take      place as well. This presents the perfect opportunity to change focus onto      animation, without colliding with ongoing projects. 

All in all, it appears to me as both the right time and the right situation to make such a change possible. It would be really cool to see Star Wars take a risk and break up from how things *usually are done,* with the possibility of reinventing itself under the new era without Lucas in charge.

this is assuming that much more detail is added in the films, ideas are fully explored like finns force sensitivity and plots explained like palpatines return, assuming those things are added, TROS would of worked way better as two seperate films an ep 9 and an ep10, imagine theres no advertising or spoken word about an episode 10 at all, and then the movie ends on a cliff hanger and a week after the films initial release, they announce ep10, first of all great way to hype up a film, second they would of been able to handle and develop the plot lines so much easier and it wouldn't all feel so rushed.

my idea would be that there is extra content (like you know developing the knights of ren a bit, maybe adding some conflict of leader ship between them and kylo) as i mentioned before finns sensitivity and palpy, as well as and yes even if you hate her, more rose tico, love her or hate her in TLJ she didn't deserve to be cut from this film and it sucks she was, we could of gotten more ben solo in ep 10 cause ep 9 could end on his redemption.

63,"The hateful, so-called ""fans"", ruined Star Wars. Not Disney, not Rian Johnson, not JJ, not anyone else.",1593610707,"**The big irony is that this is literally the whole plot of Star Wars in the first place. About how giving in to hate and anger might make you feel good and powerful in the short term but that in the end it leads to only pain and suffering longterm.** 

*The Force Awakens:* An okay start to the new trilogy that was not well received by some fans. The movies has it's flaws and mistakes, but certainly not to the level of drama and hate people brought on it. ""Disney ruined Star Wars forever!11!!!1!!!"" was being commented on the trailer before the movie had even come out.

The result: *The Last Jedi* was changed. Which of course resulted in different creative choices that made TLJ also be hated. Again, despite it's flaws it really was not even close to how bad people were making it out to be.

*Rise of Skywalker*, same thing: They saw all the hate and attempted to distance themselves from it, making an entire new thing again. It wasn't as bad as people are made it out to be, but it definitely could've been so much more had they not been so afraid that the movie was going to be a failure.

If all those movies weren't hated with such strong passion, we would've gotten a proper story because they wouldn't have to change it in multiple times in the middle of it to try and appease their audience. Which is also why Lucas stopped making Star Wars movies after the *Prequels* in the first place. It's okay to have criticisms and dislike all these movies, but being so angry as to go and harass the actors... Seriously, wtf? 

(And now look how loved the P*requels* are... Same thing will happen to the *Sequels*)

""Well if they made a good movie there wouldn't be hate"" -&gt; You know that no matter what they had made, the same people would have hated it the same way. They already spent way too much time creating their own Star Wars in their heads and anything that isn't a picture perfect recreation of that is not good enough. And they might be the minority, but they are the most vocal. 

Remember Disney is a business. They don't care if they have to change Anakin's story arc and bring Palpatine back, they care about money first. Their fear of the movie bombing resulted in them taking extreme measures to attract people to the theatres.

And last but not least, some serious advice: If you are one of the people that can't hear the movie's title without getting frustrated and it invokes a lot of bad emotions in you, please take a step back. For yourself. It isn't healthy to let such things have so much control over you, I understand we have been loving this franchise our whole lives, and it means a lot to us. But at the end of the day it is just entertainment, and life is too short to be angry about this.

To Quote the BBC:

`The details of the law's 66 articles were kept secret until after it was passed.
It criminalises any act of:

secession - breaking away from the country
subversion - undermining the power or authority of the central government
terrorism - using violence or intimidation against people
collusion - with foreign or external forces
`

... i dont know about anyone else. but it seems excessive to begin with, cause when you put these together its very extreme. oh but then there is what they decided to call the new law:

the new law can be translated as (translated) **ORDER 66**

55,"Ideas I had for another sequel trilogy, and interquel duology. Wanted to share them and get some feedback.",1593570565," Okay, so some time ago, a Youtube channel asked if fans could write their own sequel trilogy, where would they take it ? I spent the better part of the past few months mulling over ideas, and looking into looking into older material to see what I got to work with. I have in mind another sequel trilogy set a few years after *Rise of the Skywalker*, and a interquel duology that features Mara Jade as a prominent character and focuses on Ben Solo's early childhood.

I'll describe both right here.

**....**

**Mara Jade Duology**

What I have in mind is two movies that serve as a loose adaptation of the *Legend's Thrawn Trilogy*, and a continuation of *Rebels.* I'm considering tying loose ends of *Force Unleashed* and *Fallen Order*. There's a lot of catching up I still have to do.

Mara of course is front and center of these movies, serving as a secondary antagonist turned hero, with Thrawn seemingly as the main villain for the first film; unbeknownst to the characters, and even Thrawn himself, Palpatine's resurrection is occurring and his spirit is lurking, already probing into Ben Solo's mind, but most we hear of it, is this whispery voice Ben hears and is too scared to bring up. We get in depth focus on Mara's role in The Emperor's Hand, and see she has committed Kylo Ren level atrocities in the name of the Empire; this is before she gets a semi-repeat of her initial arc, and relationship with Luke Skywalker. This version follows the same kind of bond Rey and Ben had in *The Last Jedi*, but more expressly romantic, and they end up getting together at the end of the first film.

The main conflict in the first movie at least is Mara has received what she believes to be posthumous orders of Palpatine to collect force sensitive children, primarily targeting Ben Solo; in the process, she not only captures a three year old Ben, but Luke Skywalker as well with the intent on trying him for crimes against the empire. Taking force sensitive children puts her in conflict with Thrawn and his goals, taking his ""Even Evil Has Standards"" instance from *Thrawn Alliances* into account. We'd also feature, a younger Enric Pryde to flesh out his history a little with the Empire, serving as a foil to Mara and Thrawn and moonlights as a leader of Mercenary allies of the Emperors Hand - something that cuts him from being a generic Admiral.

Mara and Luke start to bond of course, but we also get Mara forming a motherly bond with little Ben (which serves as a callback to her and Luke's son in *Legends*). While it's meant to be sweet and loving on her end, we also see that Mara is not a good influence on her honorary nephew, such as telling him tales about what a great leader Darth Vader was, recounting a story of instances where she encountered him and sees him as a Father To His Men type. On the flipside, we get one sequence, Mara uses to force to fly a giggling Ben in a flurry of blue butterflies.

There's a joke I've always wanted to see in *Star Wars* that I put here; I think somewhere there'd be a sequence of Luke, Han, Leia, Ben, Chewie and Mara exploring the ship of a bounty hunter and mercenary army; or even a captured Emperor's Hand station. We see a trophy room that includes Xenomorph skeletons, as well as Yautja skulls, armor and weapony among the trophies, promoting either Luke or Han to ask ""*What the Hell have these guys been hunting ?*"" within Ben's earshot, prompting Leia to give them a death glare.

The second films takes place two years later, were Mara is not only pursing a romantic relationship with Luke, but is secretly pregnant. I wanted to hit the Deconstruction button with the idea of Kylo living past redemption, with Mara in Kylo's place; Mara in this continuity is guilty of the same kind of war crimes that Kylo Ren is, so her living among the new republic and relationship with Luke garners controversy among the galactic government, who accuse the Skywalkers of nepotism for keeping her around. So Mara has to put up with some bad publicity.

Now the conflict in the second movie has nothing to do with an army of the empire or anything, but rather a natural occurrence; a chain reaction of black holes and supernovas are set to spark and wipe out several planets and cause untold destruction across the galaxy. And no, this isn't some sort of shadow plan or weapon by Palpatine, it is meant to be a natural event. Although I was thinking that maybe it could have been some sort of side effect of the war. Matter of fact, Thrawn and his faction have entered an uneasy team up with the Republic and Skywalkers to try to find a way to stop it. This is to give an dynamic that presents of the Emprie's Remnants and Republic having to work together to stop a common threat; takes Thrawn from being an strait antagonist to an uneasy ally to the Skywalker's. While I couldn't think of a villain who could take a role as such a threat, I felt a natural event of this scale would provide Mara with the mother of heroic sacrifices, since I wanted her to go out in an epic way...

In one of the most reaching and epic feats of the force I can think of, Mara ends up taking the force of these supernovas and black holes, sacrificing her life in the process and saving the galaxy. The duology ends on a bittersweet note; the galaxy is saved, but Luke has lost his lover and unborn child in the process; while consoling Ben, he promises he's never going to give up on him (earlier on Luke, in a spur of a moment prioritized saving Mara over saving Ben); while Thrawn and his remnants are destroyed over the film, forgone conclusion dictates the Sequel Trilogy will happen - Thrawn ends up in Exegol to investigate a signal, where upon he is executed by the half formed, resurrected Palpatine, fearing that Thrawn could interfere too much with his plans. On top of all that the Republic refuses to credit Mara as a hero so as to avoid lionizing her...

We then get an epilogue, set between the events of *The Last Jedi* and *Rise of the Skywalker.* Kylo Ren has arrived in an abandoned city, recognizing it as a former government facility, that includes a historical library. While alone, he finds an unwritten history book of past heroes; he sits down and start thinking over memories of his Aunt Mara, and writing about the kind of person she was as well as her feats and heroism. After finishing the book, he discreetly has it sent to a Resistance outpost, where it ends up in Leia's hands, along with a letter of explanation. This ensures that no matter who wins between the Resistance and the First Order, Mara and her legacy will be preserved.

**....**

Now for where I continue from the Sequel Trilogy; what I call ""***The Blood of Revan Trilogy***"".

Set four years after the *Rise of the Skywalker*, a new republic is formed, as is a new Jedi Order. Poe has taking the role of Senator and trying to pick up where Leia left off, thinking to himself ""What would Leia do ?"" Finn is working in a Jedi temple, being a popular teacher to the students; many of whom are force sensitive children saved from the First Orders recruitments by Lando and Jannah. Both Finn and Poe are inexperienced in matters of politics, which the new Jedi Order is reliant on since it is a far more extreme version of the old Jedi Council. Rey is Finn's secret mentor in mastering the force, so Finn is technically a proxy teacher in the new temple.

Rey herself, isn't part of the New republic or Jedi order, because much like Leia before her, her dark side parentage is revealed by a whistleblower after Palpatine's plans were uncovered following the battle of Exegol. From she is seen by the officials as a ""usurper"" of the Skywalker name, and one particular Jedi Knight sneeringly calls her Palpatine to her face; any attempt to defend Rey is met with backlash and while not a public enemy, she is a Hero With Bad Publicity. Many refuse to acknowledge she was the one who destroyed Palpatine, because much like Mara Jade before her, they don't want to lionize her (that same line of thinking is also why some refuse to accept that Vader and Anakin are one and the same). This doesn't stop Rey from forming her own underdog Jedi Order over the course of trilogy.

Among the new cast of characters, the most important of them are the Shan family, the titular Blood of Revan. As you can guess, they are distant descendants of Revan and Bastila and consist of a twin brother and sister, as well as the sister's seven year old son. The legacy of Revan and Bastila hang over them, and thus it's believed that they have a grand destiny within the force.

Brother Shan is named  Jason; he is this cocky, arrogant, aspiring Jedi knight with dreams of being a master. He's handsome, charming, dashing, and a total lady-killer. Above all else, he is a member of the New Jedi Order, with dreams of being the next great hero like Luke Skywalker, having grown up idolizing Luke, Obi Wan, Anakin, Asoka, etc...he's also a heartless egomaniac who doesn't care if the Galaxy is saved, so long as ***he's*** the one to save it...or a least as long as he's *seen* as the hero.

The way Jason's initially presented, has you thinking that maybe he's going to be the new hero for the new generation. He has a rivalry with Poe in matters of the Jedi Order vs the Senate, that you think he'd put aside for the greater good. You think maybe, he will overcome his arrogance, be a Jerk With A Heart of Gold, who comes around at the end. *Nope*; bit by bit, he becomes one of the main villains of the trilogy, as he shows his true monstrous colors. He's the kind of guy who'd willingly let ""ungrateful"" civilians die if they didn't fall to their knees in adoration when he kills several bandits. Part way through the trilogy, he slaughters his detractors and usurps the Jedi Council, forming an order of Dark Jedi in the process.

The Sister Shan is named Eliana is not force sensitive herself, but she is a darkside worshiper...or at least she was. At some point she was contacted by the First Order, not knowing of Palpatine's influence. Snoke attempted to groom he in the same way he did with Kylo Ren. Eliana for whatever reason couldn't use the force, despite the heavy presence of midichlorians in her blood, and was deemed useless by Snoke. This didn't stop Kylo Ren from befriending and protecting her, and the two would eventually have an affair. A few years before *The Force Awakens*, Eliana would end up conceiving a child with Kylo Ren, unbeknownst to anyone else (including Kylo himself) and ended up fleeing to a planet in the unknown regions...a planet that while weak in the force, has a pull to the dark side.

Eliana's son is named Kadius (or Kade for short). He is seven at the start of the trilogy. For the most part, Eliana has raised Kadius alone, and taught him tales of his ancestors - she is introduced recounting stories from *The Old Republic* as a bedtime story. He has a high midichlorian count that rivals Anakin, and so far in his life has shown displays of the dark side. From such, the new Jedi Council fear he's going to grow into a new dark lord, and bring a new era to the Sith. The first film's conflict revolves around Rey, Finn, Rose, Jannah and Poe having to rescue Kadius from a galaxy wide manhunt ordered by the Republic and enforced by the Jedi, who believe Kadius needs to die, least another dark lord rises. In the process, Poe loses his position as senator for casting out his support of the manhunt and aiding desenters.

Now despite, Eliana raising Kadius as a believer in the dark side, teaching him the history of Revan, she turns out *not* to be an abusive parent. She is a loving mother who is trying to protect her son from a galaxy she correctly guesses wants him dead, and she is very supportive of him choosing his own destiny. Not that it saves Eliana from being brutally murdered and decapitated by her remorseless brother, who proceeds to gaslight her traumatized son into believing *he* is somehow responsible. Despite his mothers death, Kadius does get a better support system, and gains an adoptive mother figure in Rey (who gets quite a few Mama Bear moments throughout). The rest of the trilogy follows Kadius as he grows from a teenager to a young adult, and defying his alleged dark side destiny.

There is much I plan on putting into this hypothetical trilogy, that I'm still mulling over different ideas. These include an exploration into the World Between Worlds, where Kadius would meet his father, and his other ancestors; the ultimate villain of the trilogy being a Sith god, like say, Typhojem; an overarching subplot where Finn meets his father, who turns out to be a dark side worshiper, and supporter of the Empire who willingly gave Finn to the First Order as a baby; a war of force ghosts, both Light and Dark Side. This would culminate in Kadius becoming the leader of his own order, The Grey Jedi Order, the force spreading into other galaxies, prompting many expeditions into these galaxies.

Rey, Finn, Rose and Poe would embark on one such expedition with their armada. Finn and Poe are heard talking about this one galaxy that the force hasn't reached yet ""*Locally, it is known as the Milky Way, and insofar as we can tell, only one planet with sentient life*."" Camera pans to Rey, who smiles and replies *""I think I know where we're heading first then.*""

62,"Fans of The Last Jedi, why do you like it?",1593569286,"I hope this post doesn't become a toxic powder keg but I'm really curious to hear an actual perspective on why they like TLJ. 

You see, I'm a fan who dislikes both TLJ and TROS. TROS is a really poor attempt at apologizing for TLJ and is also feels like multiple movies crammed into a 3 hour movie. So what I'm saying is that I can see why people hate TROS, but what I don't understand is why do people like TLJ. The only real positive point aside from the great acting, direction, cinematography, and special effects, there's a lot I find lacking in the story.

 I'm not going to harp too much with the Luke and Rey stuff because that part of the movie I found to be the most interesting (regardless of me not necessarily liking it). I can see why people liked this part of the movie and I think it has the most thought and depth put into it. What REALLY drags the movie down in my opinion are the Resistance part of the story with Poe and the Canto Bight stuff with Finn and Rose. These parts of the movie for me are quite boring which really stinks because Finn was my favorite character for TFA. When I was watching the movie for the first time, I wanted to fast forward through these parts and get back to the cool jedi stuff.

George Lucas: Obvious reasons are obvious. 

Mark Hamill: Aside from being the hero of the OT, he has continued to personify and be a part of that character for 40 years. Owns it! 

Dave Filoni: The. Clone. Wars. Nothing further. 

Timothy Zahn: Gave us one of the smartest, most calculating villains.

It wouldn’t have to be said when these movies are set, as they happen in their own little bubble, separated from the story at large. Would be cool to visit some of the planet out there, and even some of the distrusting elements. Something *SW* has never really done is horror.

14,Why I want to see a far future trilogy,1593559348,"In discussions related to what the fans want to see next, the general trend is towards exploring the past. I don't necessarily disagree with this, as there are many topics that should absolutely be explored. We should absolutely get a movie or two depicting the origins of the Jedi and the Sith, as well as something good related to the Old Republic era, when the Jedi and Sith waged epic total wars for the fate of the galaxy.

What I would really like to see is a far future trilogy, set a couple of centuries, perhaps even a thousand years after the Skywalker saga. A far future setting would grant the creators complete freedom to reimagine the setting and shake things up with new themes, new conflicts and new enemies. I would like to see that the Skywalker saga permanently altered the galaxy for the better. This would be an entirely new era, an entirely new playground. Here's how it could look like...

The Sith are nothing but a bad memory. Peace has reigned for centuries. Evil cowers, and the reborn Jedi Knights are scattered across the stars, aiding the peoples of the galaxy and fighting injustice wherever they find it. The Jedi of the future should be a complete inversion of the decaying old Order that was brought to ruin in the final days of the Republic and destroyed by the Sith. Instead of being isolated on Coruscant, there are now hundreds of Jedi temples on a hundred different worlds. Instead of hoarding the knowledge of the Force, the New Jedi freely share it with anyone who wants to learn. Instead of blindly serving the Republic, the Jedi are integrated into their local communities and they serve the peoples of the galaxy and the will of the Force. As a result of centuries of sustained efforts to improve the galaxy spearheaded by the Jedi and the New Republic the future is almost utopian.

And then something major happens that shakes up the setting and forces the Jedi and the Republic to fight for everything that was built in the last thousand years. This new threat should be completely unlike anything we've seen. I would propose something like the High Republic's Great Disaster, but positive. Suppose that suddenly, millions of people around the galaxy started becoming Force-sensitive out of nowhere. This would immediately invite turmoil and conflict, throwing everything into question. The our heroes would have to navigate a difficult path to maintain peace and justice in the galaxy.

What is fundamental here is that THERE SHOULD BE NO OLD ENEMIES! No evil empires, no cackling space Hitlers, no anything like that. Okay, maybe I'm not totally opposed to bringing back the Sith. Perhaps in all the turmoil, someone stumbles upon an ancient Sith temple and somehow revives the spirit of some long dead Sith Lord. But they should not be the main enemies, and if a Sith Lord appears, they should be an unconventional Sith Lord. Possibly some Joker-like maverick who really doesn't care about being a Sith and is more interested in chaos for its own sake.

I personally thought that Awakens and Last Jedi were actually pretty good. Awakens is safe and not too daring but still pretty fun with good sequences, characters and acting. Last Jedi pleasantly surprised me in being rather adventurous with some more experimental elements and themes of failure and morality, while sharing the same qualities as Awakens.

It was definitely NOT an individual comic as didn't buy these sort of things - only annuals or similar collections. UK published almost certainly.

So - in this comic, it was a retelling or flashback (Obi Wan? C-3PO? Have a feeling it was a droid flashback so either C-3PO or R2 D2) back to the time of the Jedis/Clone Wars and in the flashback, there is this starship travelling through an asteroid storm - and the flashback is around Obi Wan(?) or a Jedi travelling on the starship and saving someone/doing something while the asteroid storm is raging around the starship?

Very hazy and can't remember much more detail beyond that although I know if I saw the comic, I would remember :)

Any ideas?!",StarWars,Mrdini,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hiy3g2/trying_to_recallfind_an_early_1980s_comic/
27,This is important,1593556962,"Star wars’s true message

The message is get the low ground

Think about it, when Kenobi fought Anakin he had the low ground when giving the finishing blow. When he killed Grevious he had the low ground, he also relinquishes the low ground multiple times during the fight. He also beats maul from the low ground, even though he gains the high ground, he is the master of low ground so can use both forms. 
Then, in the same movie, mace windu has the high ground against palpatine and loses the fight because of it, the only reason the younglings didn’t win against Anakin was because they hadn’t mastered the low ground.
Also, in the sequels, Yoda is the grand master, the most powerful Jedi. This is intact because he has the low ground all the time. You may then want to point out that he lost to palpatine, however, if you watch the clip when he gets launched in the air he gains the high ground, hence why he looses.
And this is just the tip of the iceberg, at the end of return of the Jedi Luke has the low ground and manages to use it to manipulate Vader to throwing palpatine into the reactor shaft. And this isn’t the first time we see it in the ot, obi wan becomes “more powerful than you could ever imagine” after having the low ground to Vader (who is taller than him). 
Then, in the sequels, Luke actually tries to kill kylo because he knows kylo will always have the low ground. Then, in Crait, kylo could have stayed in his ATAT, however, he relinquishes the high ground because he knows like will win if he has the low ground. In addition to this, all of the Patorian guards and smoke were taller than Rey and Kylo so had the high ground so all died.
Then, in The last skywalker, Rey has the low ground against palpatine and wins and the real proof is that kylo comes from the lowest of grounds, a gravity well, and has enough power to trade places with Rey.

33,A question about Rise of Skywalker's most epic scene...,1593555871,"It's about the part where the past Jedi talk to Rey. First I just gotta say I utterly love this scene and here's why I'm hoping to find an answer to this. Firstly, I know it would have been better if we saw them maybe as force ghosts or visions but hearing them was better than not having them at all so I'm thankful for that at least. It's wonderful cause of how Hayden, Ewan, Liam, Alec (past line he did was edited to say Rey) and other actors got to return to Star Wars for the first time in years including Ahsoka Tano's voice actress being in the Skywalker Saga for the first time. Second reason is cause it's like a reverse order 66 getting back at Palpatine for all the shit he made them go through! Or kind of like the portal scene in endgame with all the dead returning to fight back but one question remains.

Were all the Jedi that ever existed conscious and around Rey or just the 11 heard speaking? I hope to think it was all of them cause having all the Jedi together at once helping to finish off Palpatine would have been far more awesome and satisfying. It made sense I thought for the main Jedi to appear. Luke, Anakin, Obi-Wan, Yoda, Mace, Qui-Gon, Ahsoka and Kanan (the last two at least were main Jedi outside the Skywalker Saga). The others however have much smaller roles appearing in the prequels and not even speaking there before. I'm surprised we didn't hear a Jedi like Ki-Adi-Mundi like he's the only non-main Jedi to talk in the films or Kit Fisto or Plo Koon they had a lot more screen time. But if my question is yes then they would have been there.

One thing odd though is that Leia is a main Jedi yet wasn't heard. It sounds like she was supposed to because in the trailer Luke says the same line he says at the end of the scene ""The force will be with you, always,"" although in the trailer Leia says ""always,"" and I think being a main Jedi she should have joined the scene and still said ""always."" Qui-Gon does back this up by saying ""Every Jedi who ever lived, lives in you,"" I dunno if he meant that metaphorically with her being the only Jedi left or that the force voices were kept alive but her being in contact with them. Is there any reason why the Jedi we heard could be there as I know only Anakin, Luke, Leia, Yoda, Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon learnt how to be force ghosts so the others became only voices at least...?

TLDR: Were all the Jedi ever during the scene where Rey hears voices there or just those we heard? Qui-Gon does say that every Jedi who ever lived lived in Rey so perhaps I thought.",StarWars,Atalkingpizzabox,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hixqcf/a_question_about_rise_of_skywalkers_most_epic/

55,How likely is it that the Ninth Sister survived?,1593549187,"
Posted on r/jedifallenorder and decided to ask here too.

The Ninth Sister is very tough, and I doubt a sliced off hand and a slashed spine would do much to her. It looks like she suffered 2 or 3 major hits, but none of them fatal. She would be weakened by Cal when she lost her hand and her spine got hit, and maybe paralyzed. 

The huge fall didn’t help her chance of survival either, but this is probably an everyday thing for the Ninth Sister.

I think she might have left the Empire out of shame to losing to Cal and hid down low for a long time until she died quietly, years after her battle with Cal. She’s too tough to die in combat like that. Or maybe she rejoins the Empire and there just isn’t any material covering her past stuff in Jedi Fallen Order.

68,The origins of the Jedi.,1593546408,"Almost every movie, videogame, comic, series and book of Star Wars have at least one character using a laser saber and/or able to move things with their minds, generally a Jedi or a Sith. Exceptions to this rule are hard to find. For some years the Expanded Universe of Star Wars tried to explain their origins. However, Episode VIII brought some new clues that give rise to a few questions on how to reconcile the origin of the Jedi with other versions dealing with the Tho Yor spaceships, the Planet Tython and the precursor Je'daii Order. For instance, there are still some gaps.

I will give a try to reconcile those versions:

More than 36,000 years before the Battle of Yavin (BBY) in Episode IV, the force already existed in the galaxy. There were some intelligent creatures sensitive to the force. Not all of them had enough technology to undertake space travel. 

According to Episode VIII, after the New Jedi Academy founded by Luke was destroyed, he escaped to the Planet Anch-To, a very emblematic and symbolic place because it was the cradle of the Jedi Order ([https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ahch-To#History](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ahch-To#History)). He thought that Kylo Ren would not figure out that possibility. That planet had a very primitive Jedi Temple and some scrolls and other Jedi artifacts gathered by Luke. The scrolls meant that the primitive Jedi that made them lacked the technology to use modern paper, tablets, USB, disks or other devices, or if they had them they preferred to use more primitive technology.

I prefer the most romantic idea of imagining the Jedi in a kind of fantasy environment resembling the Middle Ages in that planet, with some knights, wizards, etc. The planet Anch-To is mostly composed of water with many rocky islands with cliffs and grass. It was inhabited by avian intelligent species called the Lanai ([https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Lanai](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Lanai)).  It seems that there was no other original rational species sharing the planet and they were a more evolved version of the porgs, so those two species could be like human and monkeys in comparison. I imagine that one of them discovered the force and founded a primitive order there and built the first temple. Afterwards, he/she trained the other disciples. Instead of laser sabers they would have used iron swords, but who knows. Maybe they were pacific folk preferring to meditate instead of fighting, or perhaps they only fought for defensive purposes. In any event I imagine them being capable of moving things with the force. 

After some years, possible centuries, they were discovered by another alien intelligent species. These creatures instead of destroying the order, decided to learn. Some of them became disciples. Then they shared their technology. 

As a result of this association, the Tho Yor big pyramidal spaceships are built. There are eight of them. (Here I could link the explanation with this video and a few other similar: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vj-PaZiTmKY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vj-PaZiTmKY)). 

These spaceships carried knowledge of the force and travelled to other planets. At least one of them shipwrecked on the planet Ando Priam. I guess that its crew died. However, the huge spaceship remained almost complete and resembled a pyramid in the snowy Andobi Mountains. One intelligent species inhabiting that planet had formed the Order of the Dai Bendu monks. They discovered what they thought was a pyramid and studied. Most probably their technology did not allow them to travel to other planets, so they studied the space ship for one thousand years until it activated and took off ([https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tho\_Yor](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tho_Yor)). From this point on I can stop and just summarize the rest of the story: the Tho Yor transported them to other planets to pick up more intelligent beings sensitive to the force until a big number of them were brought to the Planet Tython where the Je'daii Order was then founded. The other seven Yo Thor spaceships landed on other planets, but I prefer to invite you to read what happened to them at [https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tho\_Yor](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tho_Yor) or to watch some explanations on YouTube.

87,From a certain point of view: The unreliable narrators of the sequel trilogy,1593543303,"&gt; “The entire story of Star Wars is actually being recounted to the keeper of the Journal of the Whills—remember that?—a hundred years after the events of Return of the Jedi by none other than R2-D2.”   - George Lucas

&amp;#x200B;

   Three boys once had an adventure and each was eager to share the story with their mom.  She heard the story from each,  but each telling was flavored by the experiences and point of view of the boy telling it.  One would talk about the explosions and how heroic everyone was. The other  was silly and fun. The last  focused on the epicness of each situation.  The woman having lived a long and eventful life shares with her great-grandchildren the story as she remembers.  It is flawed in composition, disjointed, inconsistent in tone, may have factual errors, but together the spirit of the story is true.

  Why are the sequel movies so disjointed compared to the prequels and original trilogy?  First off George Lucas told us already R2-D2 is the final story teller recounting the tales to the keeper of the Journal of the Whills.  All the movies are based on his records alone. So how he gets the records is important.  In episodes 1-6. R2-D2 is front and center. He is a first hand witness to all the events.  But the sequels takes a turn. He has shut down. He is no longer recording. And when he is awake he is not part of the story. He has to be told the story by others. Each of the sequel movies are recollections of events as told by others to R2-D2.  Then R2 is adding his commentary as he retells it to us.  

  In the Force Awakens the viewer get a very intimate look into the mindset and emotional state of the all the characters of the story.   We are introduced to someone who has the ability through the force to understand others. Maz. The story is Maz re framing the events to R2 after she has explored the minds of those involved. She paints the story of their hopes and fears to explain the motivations of each person. As she has had much insight over the many lifetimes she has lived she is able to explain what the person is feeling even if they do not understand it themselves. As a result she tells an intimate story played out on the surface of each person.   

  The Last Jedi is told by someone who was given a 5 minute synopsis and then filled in the rest with a lifetime of learning and retelling of the story.  At Canto Bight Rose and Finn run into a young force sensitive slave. They have to convince him to disobey his master and help them out.  They only have a few moments so their story is brief and with few details.  This boy begins to tell the story to his friends. As he grows older he is able to free himself. He crosses the galaxy collecting stories of Rose,Finn and their adventures. Eventually the stories lead him to Tatooine where he finds a woman living alone with an old R2 unit. 

  The Rise of Skywalker is a story of hyperbole and overstated obviousness. It also focuses on R2-D2s best friend and hero, C-3PO. The Rise of Skywalker is through and through a C-3PO retelling of the story. For example a religious festival is described to its most smallest detail down to the special ornaments worn and style of dancing. Yet he is very overwhelmed by the scale of things and often will exaggerate to express the danger of the situation.  In his retelling there are a thousand of star destroyers. There are millions of ships in the rebellion fleet.  Lightning lept into the depth of space from the hands of the emperor. His retelling of what people said is lacking nuance, because communicating nuance in a diplomatic exchange can lead to misunderstandings. But despite his worry he shows bravery.  He is a hero that other depend on. R2 makes sure the story shows that. From the beginning C3PO was a voice of reason, one of the few voices in a galaxy of war, advocating for peace.  

  Now I could be way off on who the narrators are, but there are very distinct points of view of each movie. Hux appears to be 3 different people: the tyrant, the buffoon, the petty turncoat. It's because there are different narrators. Each has their own perspective on who each person is and what actually happened. Where does R2-D2 come into this? He has in his memory the same event from dozens of perspectives. He has chosen the perspective he feels is the most important to be recorded. There is a unique message in that perspective of events that needs to be preserved, even if it is a bit flawed from reality.",StarWars,llvihearsevil,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hitmvu/from_a_certain_point_of_view_the_unreliable/
88,I just need to get some thoughts about the new trilogy off my chest to people who will understand.,1593543250,"I genuinely enjoy each of the new Star Wars movies individually. However, I feel like the main issue was simply not planning well enough in advance. Rian Johnson shouldn't have been able to come in and blow up everything that Abrams had left behind. 

You can hate on Abrams for being too similar to the O.G. but he left Johnson with a lot and he basically threw it out: 

Where is Luke? 
--sitting on an island doing nothing. Don't worry about it. He's not going to fight. 

Who is Snoke? 
--Dead in the first 20 minutes, that's who. 

Who are Rey's parents? 
--Nobody, that's who. 

What will happen with Rey and Finn? 
--Nothing. But Finn might get some action with Rose! Also, did you know Princess Leia can fly in space?!

And at the end of the second movie, the only thing left for the third director (wound up being Abrams again) is that they're all alive (/Luke). Think about this in contrast with the middle installment of the other two trilogies. 

Luke's got a new arm and Boba has Solo. I just found out that Vader is my dad, so what's up with that? Yoda said there was another, so who is it? Leia is my WHAT!? 

Episode 2 sets up the Clone Wars and Anakin's doomed relationship decisions. 

The point is that The Last Jedi sets up nothing to happen in the next movie other than people lived. 

I don't want to seem like I'm ragging on Johnson. I liked his movie very much. It just has little to do with the film that came before it. And then JJ came back for movie 3 and was like, ""You know what!? Her parents DO matter. Snoak was a clone. And Finn DOES have feelings for Rey, but we're not going to go rush that development into one movie, so suck it.""

Obi-Wan does not show active signs of fear but you can see in his expression that he is anxious, specially on the second encounter (when the ship malfunctions and when the lights get back on).

Why do you think? bad acting? Qui-Gon was not afraid to die there? He doesn't feel any emotions because he is a different kind of Jedi? He needed to remain calm because he was the most 'senior' in there?

88,My view on Star Wars,1593511792,"So I wanted to take a moment to give my views on the franchise as a whole.

I grew up watching the Clone Wars on tv and playing LEGO Star Wars and Battlefront 2 and The Force Unleashed. For me this is how Star Wars has been a huge part of my life, I loved all the movies equally and everything the games, and the movies I loved. Even in elementary school my friends and I did Star Wars stuff.

When I got to High school my friends and teachers loved Star Wars so every year we always did something on May 4th, and I watched Rebels from freshman to senior year so that was a huge part of my teen years. And when the sequel trilogy was released I really like the force awakens but then the last jedi hit and I didn’t like it at all. I don’t hate the sequels but I don’t think they are good.

The fandom for me has been pretty good for me everyone I know has loved it, but I just wish we could have games like Force Unleashed and old school BF2, the games that have came out in the past 5 years hasn’t been good, the sequel trilogy maps for the new BF2 I never liked and it only should be prequel and original. 

My fav movies in the franchise are all the originals and Rouge One along with Revenge Of The Sith, these movies were amazing I remember watching the first ever one and I was hooked. 

I hope we get more great tv with more Mando and a Rebels sequel soon.

90,"Finn's role in the Sequel Trilogy and why it's more that just screaming ""REY""",1593511244,"So I keep thinking about it...  


JJ canonizes Finn Force Sensitivity. And it worked for this movie because they made it about more than just Finn being FS. I know some people didn't like Finn appearing to chase after Rey in this movie, but I think it was by design... in this movie he's making every effort to let her know that she's not alone, not in any aspect (even the Force). Through out the movie (and really the trilogy) one of the narrative messages is that we lose in isolation, when we think we are alone or when we try to go it alone. And while Anakin's fear of loss was one of his main drivers, it was isolation from the other Jedi's that made his full turn possible. It was isolation from his parents that helped make Ben's turn possible. It was isolation that Luke chose when he failed with Ben, and isolation that Rey was about to choose.  


So by the end of the trilogy Rey and Finn had traded places. He was initially wanting to leave the fight and just go it alone, and it was Rey trying to convince him to come back in TFA. She doesn't actually convince him, but he does eventually get there. In TRoS Rey is wanting to leave the fight and just go it alone, and it was Finn trying to convince her otherwise. He doesn't actually convince her either but she does eventually get there. 

Finn and Rey are essentially brother and sister, who have saved each others lives. Especially given both of their difficult childhoods bonded and are probably there for each other. 

If we're taking the character of Finn alone, he's gone from not caring (TFA), to learning to care (TLJ), to ultimately inspiring others to care (TROS -- see Jannah's reaction to Finn's stormtrooper name).",StarWars,ShambolicClown,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hikf5a/finns_role_in_the_sequel_trilogy_and_why_its_more/

Don't understand this in a wrong way I liked the sequels (except TLJ I think it's the weakest SW movie of all time) but the story acted like the originals with some extras and didn't brought something very important or useful explainations to the canon at all.

The only more or less important point are the deaths of all three heroes of the originals. 

I didn't like the scene where Rey uses the force for the healing to Ben Solo I know it depends on the dyad of the force between them but why could Rey heal the Snake on Passana aswell or (Spoiler) Baby Yoda could heal Greef Karga. It destroys the plot of Darth Vader. He turned to the dark side to safe Padmé from death but if it was as easy as this he just could have learned this ability from the old Jedi books and didn't need to use the dark side. 

That was only one example. In my opinion we wouldn't miss something if the sequels would never happened. I could live before with episode 1-6 all the time. And I think it would be way cooler if The Mandalorian would be the only SW media that's set after episode 6.

\-

*After the destruction of the Final Order, the New Republic must painstakingly re-build it's government from the ground up. Many planets are politically broken and scattered due to the toxic corruption of the First Order.* 

&amp;#x200B;

*In the wake of this corruption, pirates and gangsters fight for control of various mining planets, in order to get a foothold before the New Republic establishes planetary control. As co-captains, Poe and Finn must travel to various planets to supply relief and aid to the civilians caught in this bloody struggle.*

*Meanwhile, deep in the Unknown Regions, a threat hundreds of years in the making slowly prepares for assault. With the galaxy in such a fragile state, the attack should be quick and ruthless...*

*-*

&amp;#x200B;

A couple things!  


1. The invasion would be Grysk.
2. At some point, the protagonist (not Poe or Finn) would find out about the invasion before it happens, and need to report it to somebody...but the poor government situation makes this hard to do. Thus, this protagonist makes it his goal to find Poe/Finn, famed war heroes.
3. Somehow or another, the protag must then find a legendary commander, one who knows the Grysk well...Thrawn. 
4. We could even get some cameos if we wanted. Hell, throw Rey in for a bit. I don't really care, but Poe and Finn would not be the main characters. An unnamed and relatively unimportant protagonist is key.

Rey palpatine for the win, my favorite thing about the whole trilogy, shouldn’t have been a failed clone father, her grandmother should have been that balled lady next to him at all times in the prequels, but there species takes much much longer to give birth, she goes into hiding after some time because she sees palpatine’s true evil, he knew about the child and his son was always going to be his real apprentice, but until his son was born and ready Vader would be his apprentice, once she vanished, he decided he would use luke until he found his baby momma and there child, palpatines son spent most of his life running from the empire after they found and killed his mother, he didn’t know he could use the force until one day he tapped into the dark side to save him and his girl (reys mom) from imperial remnants, he then vowed to. It himself off from it and never use it again, once Rey was born they realized it was too dangerous to be around her, so they left hey with somebody on Jakku, and eventually they get killed. And in my story snoke is plaguies, and kyle turns from something different then luke trying to kill him lol, and Snoke ended the sith and changed his name out of embarrassment, that he failed, and deemed the sith weak, and his former self weak, now he is just a dark side wielder, and he has been hunting down Rey and wants REN to kill her because she’s the only one he truly fears, because her grandfather “thought” that he killed him in his sleep. But he already found the key to immortality beforehand. And that’s the ring on his finger. He dies with Rey tapping into the darkside to kill him and palpatine coming back for a split second and talking out of her trying to take control of her, and she kills snoke with force lighting, knocking the ring off his finger, and once she realizes the dark side is taking over she kills herself, then Ben comes and heals her and dies. Trilogy ends with plagueis vs Palpatine. She doesn’t change her name to sky walker, she is known as just “Rey” Han dies in the second movie, so in the first all 3 of our main hero’s are united for a little, Luke dies in episode 9, and Leia lives on and becomes the new chancellor to the new Republic, there is no resistance, there is just the new republic army, Finn gets millions of storm troopers to defect and that slowly helps them win the war.

17,Why Zay Versio not Zay Meeko?,1593474669,"!!Minor spoilers for Battlefront II (2016)!!

Had this question after playing the game ...

Why was Zay (daughter of Iden Versio and Del Meeko) named Zay Versio (officially, at least)?!

I know matrilineal surnames (last names) exits in real life, and most likely in Star Wars, but I don’t see any reason for it to apply to Zay:

1. Most of the characters we know of in Star Wars use patrilineal surnames (Canon), e.g. Ben Solo, Leia Organa (adoptive father’s family name), Iden Versio, and many others. 

It would be highly unusual for them to use her last name. 

2. Iden has an estranged relationship with her father. Why would she want her daughter to carry the legacy of the Versios, which were associated with the Galactic Empire.

3. Iden’s relationship with Del was decent. It’s not like she divorced him or anything. She only became a widow at least after a decade after they got married. 

In my opinion, it doesn’t make sense for them to use Versio as Zay’s last name. What are your thoughts on Zay’s surname choice?",StarWars,LeGrandAmiral,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hibvjo/why_zay_versio_not_zay_meeko/

64,"From my point of view, the Jedi are evil.",1593466317,"The Jedi were a caste of untouchable warrior monks who took young children from their families and brainwashed them into a cult for the rest of their lives. They would strictly forbid these children from having contact with their families. This was completely inhumane.

Qui-Gon could have bought the mother of Anakin Skywalker, Shmi Skywalker, from Watto, and freed her from a lifetime of indentured servitude. The sensible thing was to bring Shmi to Coruscant with Anakin, where Anakin could have undergone the Jedi training he deserved while keeping the only family he knew. Instead, Shmi was forced into a marriage with a farmer on Tatooine, was kidnapped by the Tusken raiders, and killed. Qui-Gon could have prevented this, *and* Anakin's fall to the dark side, by forking over a few credits to Watto. Hell, he could have called the Jedi Order and asked for more credits if Watto was really greedy and Qui-Gon didn't have enough credits with him.

After Qui-Gon's death, Obi-Wan could have gone back to Tatooine to free Shmi, but he didn't, which makes him as guilty as his former master, Qui-Gon. Obi-Wan was right about one thing. He failed Anakin. Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan could, independently, on many occasions, have spared Anakin a lifetime of pain and emotional suffering, but they didn't.

When Anakin went to Yoda to seek counsel about his nightmares, the best an 800 year old master of the Force and Jedi wisdom could conjure was a slightly more eloquent version of ""Get over it"". That's right, Anakin. We didn't do shit to save your mother, who died in your arms, in the middle of the desert. Then we forbid you from having attachments as a Jedi. Because apparently, supposed to be machines, Jedi are, like the droid armies they fought during the Clone Wars. Jedi aren't supposed to have emotions. That's bad, for some reason. And the one time you ask us for advice, to eat shit, we tell you; and accept that the love of your life, the only person who understands you, the only one who really cares about you, the only one who really loves you above all else, that person, try to save her, you should not. Nevermind the fact that you are the most powerful Force user in the galaxy and potentially more powerful than all the Jedi combined. Also, nevermind the fact that there's a Sith lord out there who just lost his apprentice and is looking for a new one.

Mace Windu and the Jedi Council should have granted mastery to Anakin. Anakin was the Chosen One, one of the best swordsmasters in the order, the best starpilot in the galaxy, and his midichlorian count was the highest ever recorded. Had Anakin pursued his training, he could have become more powerful than any Jedi, or Sith. He had proven himself countless times during the Clone Wars, by saving the lives of his fellow clones, and Jedi. He single-handedly killed Count Dooku, one of the most powerful Jedi ever to be produced by the order. Dooku's skill was reputed to be equal only to that of Master Yoda and Master Windu. And Anakin, still only a Jedi knight, defeated him in single combat. Anakin then saved Obi-Wan, a master, and the chancellor, and brought them back safe to Coruscant. Anakin deserved mastery more than any other actual master. But Mace Windu was an idiot, and made the wrong choice.

The Jedi were a group of evil, sociopathic, narcissistic, narrow-minded monks who thought themselves better than everyone else, followed useless rules (no attachments), and did not even bring peace and justice to the galaxy (freeing slaves would have been a good start). Darth Vader were right. The Jedi were evil. And they deserved their fate.

Note: This is not a defense of the Sith, or Darth Sidious. Both Jedi and Sith were evil, in their own ways.",StarWars,RoutineProcedure,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hi9bpb/from_my_point_of_view_the_jedi_are_evil/

Alright, let me explain. For fun, I decided I wanted to write a darth Vader script for fun. (And since it’s not canon, I’m not adhering the actual canon, outside of the movies and shows.) Since we saw how Anakin physically became Vader, I wanted to explain how he mentally became Vader. (Again, it’s just for fun.) It would explain how he got his lightsaber, which I have read the comic where that was explained (and loved it!) But since my script doesn’t care about the canon in comics, in mine he has a different way of getting his saber. Although I do prefer the comic version. 
Anyway, we would see him become more ruthless, see his rage grow, all around see how Anakin could become such a killing machine like he was in the OT. 
Most of the script is from Vader’s perspective. (Aside from a few flashbacks) But at the end of the script we see how the galaxy came to know him as Darth Vader. Because up until then, people called him the Imperial Enforcer. Anyway, I wanted a scene of Obi-Wan learning about Vader and then Qui-Gon appears to him and tells him that Anakin is Vader. But, since the film’s from Vader’s perspective and it wouldn’t make sense to just cut to that, I was wondering if it could be a post credit scene.",StarWars,camdensparks,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hi8l9k/would_it_be_okay_if_the_star_wars_anthologies_to/

I decided to watch Star Wars during this pandemic. I hadn’t watched all of the movies together in years. I never understood why I liked this movie so much. It took me a while to realize, but now I do. I feel happy whenever I watch Star Wars. I don’t have to be in this place that I hate so much. I understood why I had fallen in love with this movie and why I cared so much for every character and every actor. I understood why I loved every part of it, everything from one place to the whole galaxy. 

I’ve always wanted to figure out where I fit in, and whenever I am surrounded by other that also have the same love for the movie as I do, I fit in. I wish I could I just leave this world and live in the Star wats universe. I could be a pilot, like Poe and Luke. Or a Jedi even, maybe just live as a farmer on Tatooine.

47,Yesterday I watched the final 2 episodes of the Clone Wars Season 7. I have some thoughts that I’d like to share.,1593452251,"I thought the end of Season 5 was a great way to finish the whole thing off but the end of Season 7 is even better. 

11 year old me wouldn’t believe you if you told him what was going to happen. But 23 year old me can’t believe it either. 

When the last episode finished I felt the same way as I do when I come out of the cinema after seeing a Star Wars movie. And it was only 23 minutes. I couldn't stop thinking about the best parts which is what usually happens after I see a new movie for the first time. 
It was so fucking intense. I knew basically what was going to happen but I didn’t know exactly how it was going to happen. 

Here are some of other thoughts:

* Maul was so good. Especially when he chopped off clone trooper heads and arms without even using a lightsaber. 

* It was really cool to see Darth Vader with the Snowtroopers and Stormtropers at the end.

* I liked the little droid team. I didn’t know about that. 

* Everything part of Captain/Commander Rex’s story was great. Even when he was temporarily “evil” and trying to kill Ahsoka. I wasn’t expecting it to happen like that. 

* I didn’t know exactly how Order 66 was going to happen. I knew it was coming but I didn’t know when. Before it happened there was constantly a sense of foreboding. 

* The Clone Troopers were my favourite part of the whole Clone Wars series and I loved how much action they got in these episodes. Even though they were “bad guys” for most of it. 

* There was also a lot of peril when Rex and Ahsoka trying escape and get off the ship. I wasn’t sure they were going to make it. Even though I knew they survived I was still worried about them.

I may add some more thoughts later.",StarWars,FigureItOut50,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hi4gyy/yesterday_i_watched_the_final_2_episodes_of_the/

So after the events of Rise of Skywalker, Rey goes on a journey to perfect her Jedi skills all the way while Finn wants to learn about his past and where hes came from (I can't explain the whole plot because I haven't thought of it but I'm just giving a base idea). Eventually Finn finds out his father is Mace Windu and that when Mace was killed by palpatine, his mother had nowhere to go and the Jedi was falling apart and Finn was taken by the Empire and trained as a trooper. So now Finn knows he is force sensitive for sure and decides to learn the ways of the Jedi. Eventually he masters the ways of the force but he is reluctant to use a lightsaber because he prefers guns and decides to take some thought if he really wants to become a Jedi. On his shorty journey he finds his father's lightsaber completely broken. But inside the lightsaber, his fathers purple kyber crystal is still alive and he decides to take it. He shows everyone back home and he has an idea. He makes a completel whole new gun and that guns main source is Mace Windus purple kyber crystal. So Finn uses the force and its abilities but his main weapon is not anoghtsaber but a gun powered from the same thing as lightsabers, a kyber crystal. I know I didn't go into much detail about his journey and how he stumbles upm his father's lightsaber but this is just the main idea. Thanks for reading!

But Death Troopers however were genetically improved unlike Inferno Squad and were made ""beyond-human"". They also were equipped with more elite equipment than Inferno Squad. That made me think ""Why are there more of Death Troopers than Inferno Squad soldiers?""

93,A potentially realistic take on how EA would make a podracing game.,1593442539,"To start off, I don't think EA is really all that bad. I'm not even a shareholder in EA, and I don't even remember the last EA-published game I bought and played. (Star Wars Squadrons does look fun, though.) I think the podracing concept is something that still has potential, given that both podracing games have been re-released on the PS4. 

I would imagine that EA's podracing game would include a combination of returning and new characters, the least of which being Anakin and Sebulba. I would not, however, anticipate any tracks returning, though the general locales might, such as various planets, as well as EA's take on the Boonta Eve Classic. 

Ideally, I'd like to see some sort of combination between Episode I Racer and Racer Revenge, specifically the sense of speed and fragility in the former, and the destructive aspect in the latter, especially since there's no respawning in Racer Revenge. I also had a slight preference for how upgrades were handled in Episode I Racer, as well as the fact you could employ pit droids. 

As for DLC, I could easily see Watto being the NPC where you buy DLC in-game, and would mostly be podracers - one pack could include Jin Reeso and Cy Yunga from Episode I Racer, while another could include Watto, Darth Maul, and Darth Vader from Racer Revenge. Yet another pack could include both the EPI and Racer Revenge variants of Anakin and Sebulba. Then there could be some racer packs that include some racers from Episode I Racer and/or Racer Revenge that aren't in the vanilla, such as if they wanted to add Occo Ninebar, or Toy Damper. 

Perhaps even more interesting upgrades could be added - not only could Sebulba get a flamethrower, but other podracers could get other destructive weapons - maybe even something as small as throwing a small piece of debris behind them to heavily damage a following racer. There could be pit-stops, too, like we see in TPM and Ody Mandrell, and could appear alongside on-board repairs, but there could be trade-offs for each strategy. 

Another feature could be betting credits on racers, just like they sort of do in TPM, and a bit like NFS Payback's ""side bets"" mechanic. 

As for trophies/achievements, I'd definitely include staff time trials, as well.

Finn and Leia have some noticeable similarities when you look at the way their charters develop throughout their separate trilogies.  


There was an instant connection between Finn and Rey just as there was between Luke and Leia. The movies pushed us to think/want them to be together but ultimately it never happens.   


The separate trilogies make an effort to showcase how both Finn and Leia are force sensitive, although we never see any further Jedi training within their own respected trilogy.

I'm just presenting this as a setup because at that time, 3+ years ago is when I watched the Mortis Gods arc in CW....and it still haunts me to this day.

There is something so strange, powerful and yet eerily lonely about those episodes, and I can't figure out why they resonate and affect me so much.  The concept of this incredibly powerful family of Force wielders who have to remove themselves from the Universe because of their omnipotence is strange and simultaneously compelling.  Perhaps it's also the designs of the episodes/how everything looks so majestic and unique, but so...barren.  I dunno.

55,I just had a realisation,1593417266,"Now you guys might have figured this out ages ago, but here I go:

I believe that Anakin did bring balance to the force, but not by killing Palpatine. The Jedi misinterpreted the prophecy (even though we are never told the contents of the prophecy explicitly). The Jedi took it to mean that the chosen one would destroy the Sith and the dark side, but that isn't balance. In fact it's the exact opposite. Anakin brought balance to the force by destroying the Jedi order.

Two Sith and thousands of Jedi isn't balance, so there are two ways to fix that: train more sith or kill more Jedi, and Anakin did the latter. Everybody in-universe (and me also) thought that ""balancing out the force"" meant destroying the dark side, and I always thought ""how does killing Sheev balance it?"" because while it is never explicitly stated, we are led to believe that the prophecy is fulfilled at the end of RoTJ, but it isn't. It happens at the end of RoTS.

[\-  Han Solo: A Smuggler's Trade](https://youtu.be/BvPfCTyd3X8): I think Jamie Costa is a great Han Solo/Harrison Ford.  It feels a tiny bit campy, but I like to imagine that this is an interpretation of a story told from Han's point of view at a bar after he's had a few drinks.

\- [SC 38 Re-Imagined](https://youtu.be/to2SMng4u1k): Can you imagine what people's reactions would be in 1977 if this was actually what was on screen?  I'll admit, I'm not a big fan of the shaky cam at times, but it's not that big of a big deal. 

\- [Darth Maul: Apprentice](https://youtu.be/Djo_91jN3Pk):  The actor for Darth Maul really looks and feels like Ray Park.   Amazing choregraphy and great makeup/costumes.

\- [Star Wars Origins](https://youtu.be/SVSox0qApO4):  This is really interesting.  It's like a hybrid of Indiana Jones and Star Wars.  Apparently (Spoilers for the film) &gt;!Indie is also in this movie, but I didn't notice.  I don't think he's the father that dies at the end!&lt; 

\- [TIE Fighter Re Mastered](https://youtu.be/E9GRYa_3gno): An older anime style Star Wars animation.  Feels very retro, and very Star Wars.

\- [TK-436: A Stormtrooper story](https://youtu.be/2GdEXQ6Ulw8): I've always wanted to see a movie centered around a Stormtrooper, and this provides.  It gives us a glimpse into the lives of the real people who are usually just cannon fodder.

\- [Vader: Shards of the Past](https://youtu.be/Ey68aMOV9gc):  So this sub seems to love hating on this,  but I really enjoyed it.  Vader's voice actor was good, the effects are good, and you can tell that SWT put a lot of effort and passion into it.

1,I created a playlist for the Siege of Mandalore,1593396548,"As stated in the title I created a playlist for the Siege of Mandalore, but not just any playlist, a chronological playlist of every story and character arc which terminates in the Siege of Mandalore. I started by considering what episodes I would need to watch to review for all the character arcs that terminate in the series finale, and the more I thought about it I realized that the Siege of Mandalore includes so many story arcs that I might as well run through the entire stories of every character involved. So I decided to isolate which characters were essential to the Siege of Mandalore and list in chronological order (to the best of my ability) every episode that develops those characters. The characters I picked were Ahsoka and Maul (for obvious reasons), along with Rex and Bo Katan. But in order for those characters stories to make sense I needed to include the episodes for Barriss, Lux Bonteri and (debatably) Riyo Chuchi for Ahsoka's Development. The Domino Squad for Rex's development. Ventress and Savage Opress for the Maul Storyline to even make sense. And pretty much every episode involving the Mandalorians given that the finale is, ya know, *the Siege of Mandalore*. 

68 episodes all in all, 66 if you remove the Riyo Chuchi episodes, plus the clone wars movie for character intros to Ahsoka, Rex and Ventress. There are a total of 133 episodes in the entire series, half of which equals 66.5. It is a true testament to the skill of Dave Filoni along with the writers that not only are they able to weave together so many different storylines, but that they are able to complete with finality all of them, the combined total of which equals more than half of the show, all in the series finale. So without further ado, here it is, the beginning to end Star Wars The Clone Wars Siege of Mandalore playlist!

13,The Rise of Skywalker re-watch,1593384527,"I still have issues with the film, but I came to really appreciate more things that I missed the first time I saw it, that seem really powerful to me:

\- Daisy Ridley was perfectly cast, no one should ever fault her performance over the entire ST; while John Boyega and Oscar Issacs and Adam Driver are all fantastic, she really deserves a lot of credit for giving the trilogy a lot of heart and emotion.  Just seeing her in that split second moment as Empress Palpatine in the Death Star ruins gave me chills.

\- Palpatine coming back could have been better if only there was even the slightest explanation of how he survived, other than the line regarding Sith actions that are 'unnatural'.  I still have an issue with Exegol, primarily because it was just so dark..literally, in that it just felt too dark to see anything.  Contrast that with Snoke's throne room in TLJ which is just gorgeous set/production design.  Although, I love the Sith throne

\- The scene where Rey heals Ben and tells him she wanted to take his hand and then Ben seeing a vision of his father right after Rey leaves, both really great, emotional callbacks to TFA and TLJ.

\- I thought Threepio was the funniest he's been since Jedi; I could not tolerate him in the PT

\- The lighspeed skipping scene was nice, but I kinda wish they had visited more planets.  Also, very confused by the second location which appears to be a floating city, but there was a mirror/double of the Falcon...what are we seeing? Is that reflection on water? I'm still confused about that...

\- The alien driver of the transport when they meet Lando on Passanna, with one throwaway line 'ok!', I thought was such a funny moment.  I also liked the alien children watching the puppet show and laughing.  A great little gem of a scene.

\- The giant injured slug that Rey healed, I really liked that, especially when the beast's vocalization changes slightly to indicate it was in pain.

\- Richard Grant is always fantastic, and he was perfectly cast here.

18,Everyone was wrong!!!,1593382387,"Both the jedi and sith (as well as most force users) were wrong about the force. Both of them felt that their respective sides of the force were dominant and the sought to destroy the entire other side. But they were wrong.

It's actually pretty obvious. The whole big thing was to ""bring balance to the force"" which doesn't mean to make everything on one side of it. If you have a scale and someone told you to balance it, you wouldn't pile a load of weight on one side. You would balance it. You would achieve equilibrium by making both sides equal in weight.

We see all the time in the movies how the force knows this and how it is the will of the force to balance. In the prequels for example, the light side and the jedi are dominant across the galaxy but the force wants to balance so it allows for the dark side (the empire) to take control. Also in the OT where the dark side is dominant and at the end the light side of the force returns with the death of palpatine. Even in the sequels where the light side (the new republic is dominanat so the force allows for the rise, and eventual fall, of of the first order.

The prophecy spoke of one who would bring balance to the force, meaning someone who would end the cycle of light to dark. In the last jedi in the cave on Ahch-To (the planet where Luke was) you could see an image of a jedi who was black and white, someone who was balanced between the light and dark sides. I think that this was the image of what the prophecy spoke of.

We associate light with good and dark with bad, but a dark force user could be a good person who just happens to tap into the dark side. Righteous anger can be a good thing. Also the jedi did some screwed up stuff, like kinda kidnapping children.

This bit has spoilers for jedi fallen order so dont read it if you haven't played all the way yet. In the game, the zeffo were an ancient species who despite their advances fell into ruin. Why? Because, and I quote ""Dogma blinded us to the path of balance and gradually we allowed our pride to corrupt us."" So they were too invested in one side of the force which allowed the other to destroy them.

Boom. Literal direct proof of all this! Feel free to point out holes in my theory!

Also side note. This is why I love the idea of a grey jedi or someone who taps into both the light and dark side of the force. I would love to see a cannon grey jedi.",StarWars,slkieler,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hhnm9a/everyone_was_wrong/

23,An unlikely but cool theory for the future of Star Wars....,1593380003,"Following the heavy rumors that Ahsoka will appear in The Mandalorian season 2, I can imagine a ridiculous, but interesting direction for future SW content. 

If Ahsoka indeed appears in Mando S2, then it would probably be to take over baby Yoda from Din Djarin. Both because Ahsoka (besides Luke) would be the most capable character that we know of at that point in time to further investigate the case of Baby Yoda, and because I believe that the story of the Mando past season 2 will mainly revolve around the Mandalorian legacy and their revival after the Empire era.

Now, since we havent heard anything of Baby Yodas species, it leads me to believe that its home world is some place far from the galaxy that we know of, outside the outer rims, maybe even in another galaxy. To bring Baby Yoda home, and discover the seemingly force-power species, Ahsoka would have to travel there with the child. The new world they would arrive in, would be disconnected from the events of the galaxy that we know of, at least in the greater scheme of things. This would open up to completely new possibilities of stories, a fresh start.

This way Ahsoka would get a major role in the future of Star Wars. I find this both fitting and deserved: At the end of Clone Wars, and during Rebels, Ahsoka gives the impression of a true Jedi, devoted to do good, to follow the *will of the force*. Her decision to leave the Jedi Order only emphasizes this. In addition, she seems to be mysteriously linked with Morai, of the Daughter from Mortis. This makes me believe that Ahsoka is destined for greater influence in the Star Wars mythos. But if she was to be this significant of a character, then the question of where she is during the sequels comes immediately to mind. The theory I proposed would explain that she moved to another ""world"", where new events take place independently from our galaxy.

One reason I find this somewhat believable is because Lucasfilm themselves seem to be aware of the failure of the Sequels, both in finance and in fandom. No new content is planned or rumored around the ST. Unpopularity of new characters. All actors seem to want nothing further to do with Star Wars, the list goes on.... Ironically, following the success of Clone Wars S7, it is Ahsoka that right now is the ""hottest"" character to tell stories around. She has the most potential, most background and most support from the fans.

This way, Lucasfilm could ""move"" away and ignore the sequels, without officially ""retconning"" them. And if the rumors of Dave Filoni being in creative charge of all Disney+ series are to be true, then it would only make sense that he would do it through his beloved character Ahsoka Tano, and the thing that shook the internet; Baby Yoda.",StarWars,JanBEB,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hhmxpk/an_unlikely_but_cool_theory_for_the_future_of/
24,Rian Johnson's and JJ Abrams' visions and how they interconnect with each other,1593379672,"I see people talking about how the two directors have vastly differing ideas/visions for the ST, but to me the only real difference is that JJ is more about the consequences of the unknown and how it drives us, whereas RJ is more about examining the sides of a situation for what it tells us about our ontology - that's what's fascinating to him.  
But in both TFA and TLJ, the topic, if you really just boil it down, is *fear.*  


JJ (in TFA) explores fear of the unknown and uncertainty as a primary driver, while RJ explores how fear stalls growth and holds the future captive.  
They are contradictory in nature, but they coexist regularly all around us. Both are true statements, and both can be true inside of one person at the same time.  


These are great topical explorations to have side by side as together they highlight one of the great paradoxes of human psychology.  


With TROS, we see the topic of fear rounded up and pushed through to a conclusion. Fear of the unknown and uncertainty is a primary driver. Yes, but fear also stalls growth and prevents us from moving forward. True, *but* fear of our own self and our own internal unknown *also* can boil up to the point where it becomes intolerably stressful and pushes us to action and resolve, which ultimately brings us to self-realization.  


TROS basically pulls the topic together in a really interesting way, and it's only possibly because RJ pulled on the topic in his way, and JJ pulled on the topic in his.",StarWars,ShambolicClown,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hhmu29/rian_johnsons_and_jj_abrams_visions_and_how_they/

31,The Jedi deserved to be crushed. A rant.,1593377369,"So this is a bit of a rant/opinion piece and if you make it through this then I commend you. Please feel free to to pose your own thoughts in the comments particularly around ethics and morality of the Jedi during the clone wars.

Star Wars, for me, has always been highly philosophical. Even from an early age, even without any knowledge of philosophy, one can tell its levelled around morality at its most base level; good versus evil, the light versus the dark. “Without darkness there can be no light” quite a potent quote. 

During my time off from work in this pandemic I have been watching YouTube videos on the lore behind Star Wars, particularly the legends stuff (if any one could guide me to good you tubers that go into this that would be much appreciated). My knowledge of the lore is, well, spotty but it seems to me that the Jedi have always been hypocrites. Morally sound but some what hypocritical; a peacekeeping warrior is, in my opinion, an oxymoron. However, I believe the force was content in this as the Sith or “non-do gooders” we’re absolutely hell bent on domination and power. 

And this leads me to the clone wars where my real anger (ironic) comes in. Through out the ages the Sith have been pretty predictable; a lust for power at any expense. The Jedi however have perverted there own order not just by leading armies (again oxymoron) but by a) allowing the republic to commission a clone army and b) LEADING SAID ARMY. The creation of life for the sole purpose to die is a moral and ethical perversion of who they were supposed to be and I believe this to be truly evil. 

How can the Jedi be a part of this? Does the sanctity of human life not matter to the Jedi? Is free will not important to the Jedi? This is why I believe the force had to “restart” the Jedi using annakin/Vader as the conduit.

My house mate made an interesting point that annakin was born, without insemination, due to plagius’ search for eternal life. I reject this on the previous notion about the clone army. And that prior to plagius other Sith lived for well beyond their years with no real persecution from the force. The fight between Jedi and Sith just simply continued. 

I believe annakin was indeed the chosen one. The one to destroy and recreate the Jedi order through his own progeny (the very fact annakin had to suppress his own love and feelings and thus celibacy is again another Jedi failing)

I believe the Jedi became woefully incompetent in their own beliefs (and in general) and were becoming vicious and evil themselves, the balance of the force was becoming too heavily tipped in the favour of the darkness while the Jedi moronically believed what they were doing was right.

36,An observation of the Rebels Maul Vs Obi-Wan duel and the Duel of the Fates,1593376063,"The Dave Filoni interpretation of Duel of the Fates, how it the fate was of Anakin, as it ended in him losing this father figure that could have prevented his path to the dark side, made me think about the Rebels duel with Maul and Obi-Wan. That duel is almost a repeat. That's already clear to begin with, because of how the duel played out. Obi-Wan tricks Maul into repeating the same move he used to kill Qui-Gon, and it goes differently. Instead of Obi-Wan dying like Qui-Gon did, it is instead Maul who's finally defeated and killed. What I began to think about though, was how this is even more brilliant, due to why the duel began. Luke. Obi-Wan was doing this to protect Luke, so this duel was already about the fate of him, but even more so, it's very similar to the Duel of the Fates, because it all depends on who survives this duel. While Obi-Wan had failed Anakin due to being more like a brother figure than the father figure he needed, an argument could be made, that Obi-Wan made up for this, by taking a more parental like role with Luke. Of course we know how much of a big role Obi-Wan plays in Luke's fate and his role in the Original Trilogy. That wouldn't have happened had Obi-Wan been killed. Like how Anakin needed Qui-Gon, Luke needed Obi-Wan. So here Obi-Wan and Maul were. As Maul had once unknowingly set the path of fate for Anakin by killing the figure he needed, history was now about to repeat itself with Anakin's son. This really was the second Duel of the Fates, and Obi-Wan saw that. So he chose to trick Maul into playing out those same events, so Obi-Wan could then control the outcome, ensuring that history did not indeed repeat itself.",StarWars,ToqKaizogou,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hhlrfq/an_observation_of_the_rebels_maul_vs_obiwan_duel/

“I have a bad feeling about this... It’s somewhere elsewhere... elusive.” - Obi-Wan in the beginning of The Phantom Menace sensing the return of the Sith.

“I should think that you Jedi would have more respect for the difference between knowledge and wisdom."" - Dex was spot on about the Jedi order with this one.

“If an item doesn’t appear on our records, it doesn’t exist.” - Jocasta Nu perfectly summarizes the Jedi’s narrow-minded and dogmatic views by saying if the Jedi don’t recognize it, it’s wrong. 

“A prophecy, that misread could have been.” - Yoda on Anakin / The Chosen One prophecy. Very interesting line that has many different possibilities if re-read. 

“You don’t know the power of the dark side, I must obey my master.” - Vader tells Luke in VI after his son pleas with him to turn from the dark side. Vader’s tone and delivery imply that it’s not that easy and the dark side has consumed his life

Edit: I also love in ESB when Vader tells Luke “Obi-Wan never told you what happened to your father.” 
Just an absolutely chilling line especially after Revenge of the Sith and and we see exactly what “happens to” him and causes him to become Vader

In ESB before Han Solo is put into carbon freeze he tells Chewie that he will have to take care of the Princess when he is gone.

68,My George RR Martin-inspired take on Episode IX,1593359119,"Ultimately what rooms the First Order is lack of money. 

Hear me out, hear me out. Kylo Ren has just taken over as Supreme Leader. He doesn’t just continue things the way Snoke did—look at his conversation with Rey at the end of TLJ, he is *convinced* of the moral superiority of the First Order. So what does he do? He tries to prove that he’s right and Rey is wrong. He stops stealing children to make Stormtroopers. He starts executing any generals that are excessively cruel. 

But of course it’s not working. After TLJ the New Republic regroups. Systems that lived in fear now send their planetary defense ships to fight under Leia’s command. They win a crucial battle at the FO homeworld, plundering their resources, that humiliates Kylo Ren. Even though the Republic fleet is still far smaller they have strong morale. 

Kylo is going mad.  He’s constantly listening to whispers from Palpatine’s ghost, pushing him deeper into paranoia, splitting his mind. He starts making too many promises about what he’ll do when they take Coruscant. Promises to criminal organizations like the Hutts in exchange for the cash needed to buy ships and pay troops. 

Then Kylo finds out that Hux has secretly restarted the program to steal children. He’s enraged, attacks Hux with force lightning, but by then the generals have had enough. They knock him over the head and throw him in an airlock. 

But Supreme Leader Hux is even worse. He kills mercilessly, punishing entire planets for harboring one fugitive. He burns through all their money buying ships they don’t have the personnel fly, and of course a fancy ship for himself. By then Finn has infiltrated the stormtroopers, igniting a rebellion that causes a third of the fleet to switch sides. When defeat starts looking possible, a group of generals steals most of the rest of the FO fleet and disappears.

0,Star Wars: Legendary Edition,1593326600,"This is Star Wars for the uninitiated to appreciate the full potential of the tale told from a new perspective. 

Far far away...
A new form to take to form anew...
‐-------------------------------
IX -

A powerful dark master of an ancient art descends from his chrome chariot to commune with the undead emperor of a fallen Empire, from whose ashes his own throne had risen. Kylo Ren, upon learning of the dark lord's plan, commits himself to the destruction of their only threat.

Rey, a gifted adept of the same ancient practices, meditates in preparation for her next battle against the evil First Order. She and her team of fellow resistors learn of the undead Emporer. Rey's previous master's notes provide their first heading.

After battling the First Order, finding the dagger that will direct them further, deciphering it's meanings, almost losing our friends, and seeing a rebel spy tragically cut down in the line of duty, our heroes are within reach of the keys to victory.

Rey's master, who we learn is Kylo Ren's mother, distracts him enough for Rey to land a fatal blow, but dies in the process. Her death, Rey's forgiveness, and a calling from the spirit of his father awaken a goodness deep inside Kylo and he becomes Ben Solo, son of Han.

The undead Emporer destroys an entire planet with a single one of his Star Destroyers, newly outfitted to live up to its name. Rey and Ben confront him but his defeat can only come from the major sacrifice of one of our heroes.

In the end, Rey must lay to rest the tools of war and take up the name of Skywalker.

‐----------------------‐--------------
Solo -

An orphan on the run from a local gang joins the Imperial Academy of the Empire before the First Order. He's dubbed ""Solo"", a name we've not heard since...

He's almost eaten by Chewbacca, whom we also recognize, and the two of them hustle and fight for their lives just to lose it all in a game of sabacc. But that Lando Calrissian knows profit when he sees one and helps them along for a cut.

After sparking a slave revolt and making the Kessel Run in twelve parsecs, Han's pursuers almost get the better of him but even against a Sith Lord, he's just too elusive for the authorities.

Han is much desired for the fight against the Empire but he isn't ready for that kind of commitment. He has a sabacc rematch to win and a Hutt to see about a lucrative job offer.

‐--------------‐--------------
IV -

The less I say about this grand adventure, the better. Han and Chewie return, along with Leia, Luke Skywalker, and the awesome terror that would be the ability to destroy a planet, though that's nothing compared to the power of the force.

‐--------------‐--------------
V-

The Empire and their day shift manager, Darth Vader will not take their bloodied nose lightly. Their hidden base on Hoth is destroyed and the leaders are scattered to be hunted down and destroyed. Luke begins his Jedi training in earnest but cuts it short to face his destiny before he's ready. For his hubris, he's punished with the truth of his heritage, while Han Solo is kidnapped and taken to his old employer.

‐--------------‐--------------
II -

Darth Vader... his name alone conjures a powerful image. Anakin, however, doesn't like sand very much. He's whiny. He wears too much black. He's got creeper vibes. Impassioned and good hearted, we can empathize when the object of his devotion conflicts with his devotion to the objective and he must decide which is truly important. Anakin Skywalker could've been saved, but his teachers and the stress of war tore him down.

‐--------------‐--------------
The Clone Wars.

Anakin gained an apprentice during the war who would leave the Jedi order before the conflict's end. Her struggle weakened Anakin's trust in the Jedi.

‐--------------‐--------------
Star Wars: Clone Wars

Nobody is exempt from the war effort. If a planet's surface can support life, you had better believe it's being fought over. Anakin's experience in the war left marks on his mind and body. The conflict culminates with the introduction of a vicious new threat capable of infiltrating the Republic's Capital and kidnapping their leader. General Grevious is almost stopped by Mace Windu, but is able to escape albeit struggling to breathe through crushed lungs.

‐--------------‐--------------
III -

The Clone Wars, begun by deceit, is ended with a cover-up. The architect of both sides of the conflict had every incentive to continue fighting himself until the moment was right to usurp democracy and corrupt to intentions of our tragic hero, Anakin. His transformation is enough to warrant death on the grounds of a mercy killing. Btw, Luke and Leia are siblings. They kissed earlier. It's gross now.

‐--------------‐--------------
Rogue One -

The Empire is desperate to get their planet destroying super weapon online, but the lead engineer hid a flaw in the system, which his daughter could reveal, that it would fall in the hands of Leia, so she could bring it to the Rebellion against their oppressors.

The squadron that did the ground fighting at the battle of Scariff would inspire the name Red Team adopted after the battle of Yavin: Rogue Squadron.

‐--------------‐--------------
VI -

Luke, now a master of the Jedi arts and at odds with his own kin, rescues Han and the rest of his team so they can prepare for a battle they didn't think was coming.

The Empire is trying to blow up planets again. The Emporer, that wrinkled old egg-white, is trying to poison Darth Vader's mind again. And it's up to Luke to demonstrate power without giving into anger and compassion in the face of carnage.

Anakin, awake to his true purpose, saves the only loved one he has yet to kill. By returning to his old way, Anakin finds peace dying in his son's arms. The Empire has fallen and celebrations erupt across a hopeful galaxy.

‐--------------‐--------------
VII -

Our adventure is drawing to a close. Kylo Ren has returned to the scene with power as his prize. He works closely with a Resistance spy that makes a very convincing nazi. Stormtroopers are humanized and subsequently brutalized throughout the ordeal, but they should never have put the uniforms back on, #sorrynotsorry.

Han and Chewie introduce the fresh-faced Rey to the galaxy she would call home in place of the one rocky planet she was hidden away on.

In the battle for the fate of the Resistance over and within yet another planet-busting device, Han Solo is murdered by his son. Kylo and our heroes do battle over the cracking, crumbling husk of this doomed world and is defeated by the amateur apprentice, Rey.

She, with the aid of a map, tracks down Luke Skywalker to seek his wisdom, training, and aid.

‐--------------‐--------------
VIII -

Luke Skywalker rejects Rey for fear of repeating his mistakes, and again, out of fear of Rey herself, and what she might do with the power he could teach her. Eventually though, after some convincing from the spirit of his old master, Yoda, he agrees to train her.

After communicating with Kylo through the force, she leaves to attempt to save him from himself by turning herself in.

This whole time, Poe Dameron is learning a valuable lesson in humility.

The situation starts to look desperate before Luke walks out with a laser sword and faces down the whole First Order.

Rey enables the resistance leaders' escape as the Galaxy prepares for the final battle against the ultimate evil.

48,What was your first experience with Star Wars?,1593290170,"I still remember when I first saw the name Star Wars. It was my fifth birthday and we were celebrating at Chuck E Cheese. I unwrapped a VHS boxed set of The Special Editions. Later I watch A New Hope for the first time and I was instantly blown away.

 It started an obsession that I still have, although toned down a bit. I still remember a few years later when news of a new Star Wars movie was coming out, I got so excited. When it came out my Dad decided to see it first beforehand so as to judge if it had any inappropriate or scary content. He said it was ok but he was offended by Darth Maul, who he thought looked like the devil.(my parents are Christians). So when we saw it as a family my eyes were covered when Darth Maul stabbed Qui-Gon. But apparently my dad forgot Mauls death because I saw the whole thing. 

Over all I loved TPM because as a kid you dont notice the flaws like adults do. It was only as an adult I learned of the hatred of the film and the bullying Jake Loyd and Ahmed Best received after release. 

I guess all that combined is what started my love for this great Franchise. I love all six films. My favorite one will always be Revenge of the Sith.

61,Theory: Much of the GE was made up of humans from Coruscant's undercity,1593286961,"I'm not sure about the canon or if someone else has postulated this, but my idea is that since the GE had to phase out clones and replace them to staff thousands of Star Destroyers and Imperial outposts/facilities, they had a manpower problem.

Requirements to fill these new positions require:

Loyalty (either through sincere loyalty or brainwashing, the GE wouldn't work on intimidating others if those within did not fall in line)

Being human-ish (besides Thrawn and a few others, most staff were human since the GE was ethno-centric and human first)

A regular supply (for those who die in training and fighting rebellions)

Incentive (you can't coerce people to sign up and expect them to be loyal, most people had some job in the galaxy and paying all the staff a lot would bankrupt the GE. Since most staff are grunts, you'd expect them to get little more than sleeping quarters, meals, amenities and a small salary. most people would not leave more peaceful lives to sign up to a dictatorial military)

Few worlds were heavily populated outside the core worlds, and those that were didn't have a human majority (like Ryloth, Mon Calamari) or did not like the Empire (Corellia, Naboo) and their people would not sign up to the military. Places like Tatooine where Luke wanted to join initially had little manpower and only would have a willing populace after a few years of propaganda.

So where did the Empire get the manpower to replace clones to staff Tie Fighters, Military Installations, Training Academies and Capital Ships? I propose the underbelly of Coruscant. 

It's primarily a human world, one of the oldest and the underbelly of the planet-wide ecumenopolis had billions of poor humans. Most hated the Jedi and Republic that did little for them while the Galactic Civil War unfolded around them, and saw first hand nothing done for them during and after the assault on Coruscant by Grievous. We see this disdain in The Clone Wars final season by minor characters.

The poor have nothing to lose by joining, since many go hungry and live in squalor and crime stricken neighborhoods. The military would be heaven in comparison, as long as they kept up with the requirements in training. The sheer numbers would be able to provide the millions of grunts needed to fuel the GE military no sweat, while those who served during the clone wars from the surface and other worlds kept their higher positions in the navy structure.

Can anyone confirm if there is canon that can confirm or deny this? Or if there is anything in legends that makes this plausible? Thank you!",StarWars,TALowKY,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hh019t/theory_much_of_the_ge_was_made_up_of_humans_from/

0,The Rise of Skywalker: Why Palpatine's return makes sense (to me),1593281366,"Palps represents a constant and old evil of humanity.  


He can come back as often as a bad storm, plague, or natural disaster.  
As often as corruption, malice, envy, lust of power, zeal for control, hate for opposition and otherness, and devalued appreciation for life and sentience rises again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again in human history.  


Because Star Wars is a myth, it uses figures to represent ideas. Employing Palps as a representation of all that is evil and a twisting of humanity's (from Star Wars' perspective) ""natural"" order is par for the course.  
Using him to come back *yet again* isn't about the shock value of him coming back. Clearly. They blew that shock value *well* before the film ever came out.  
He wasn't the M. Night Shyamalan twist of TROS.  


His value is his symbolism. The evil of humanity has returned. The worst of it.  


It doesn't really matter that he's once again defeated in any difference than Skeletor once against being defeated by He-Man, or a Bond Villain once again being defeated by Bond. In Bond's case, the fact that it's *constantly* a different villain actually makes the whole affair *less* valuable, rather than more. 

It's not important *IF* he comes back. It's not important *IF* he's killed with finality or not.  
What's important is *HOW* the mortals defeat him.  


None have faced him in exactly the same way, but all of the mortal heroes *HAVE* faced him. They have faced the *SAME* measuring stick.  


* Anakin succumbed to the King of Humanity's Evil because he sought power to save those whom he loved and right justice in the world. Anakin is Star Wars' tragedy (and eventual redemption) of King David.  

* Luke denied the King of Humanity's Evil, almost giving in, but remembered his core even after torment and doubt. Luke is the Job of Star Wars.  

* Rey was the heir of the King of Humanity's Evil who denied him after doubt because of her relationship, which became her strength once she committed to her choice of values for justice.

The point in doing that was to say that Palpatine coming back repeatedly allows for a more simple conversation. It's easier to identify the metaphor and value of the villain - there is no new threat to understand as a new face of an old threat, or any such matter.  


It's simply the *same* struggle that it has *always* been *repeatedly*. 

Like all the good stuff of Star Wars - Palpatine's value isn't just that he's *Palpatine*. It's in the metaphor he represents.  
His visage returning again and again is representational of the ever constant return of the *same* evils of human psyche and the struggles that are brought by its malicious, seductive, and depressing presence. 

You can *never* truly be rid of him.  
All you can really control is *how* you choose to respond.",StarWars,ShambolicClown,False,/r/StarWars/comments/hgycvw/the_rise_of_skywalker_why_palpatines_return_makes/

38,Is it too late for live-action Clone Wars media?,1593270894,"
I don’t think any of the cast from the prequels have aged out of their roles, at least nothing that couldn’t be fixed with makeup and fx (Temeura in Aquaman for example) and I don’t any would be particularly reluctant to reprise their roles.

We’ve got Dawson coming as Ahsoka who could be de-aged to be a teenage Ahsoka (I’d honestly be surprised if we didn’t have a CW Ahsoka flashback in Mandalorian) and we know from Solo that a Witwer and Park live-action Maul works. 

As well as other things, like the prequels now being retroactively improved by the Clone Wars and that era of Star Wars just generally being appreciated these days, it seems now we have the technology, the writing, the hindsight and all the actors to do something like this.

60,Battlefront 2 mod idea: Sequel Trilogy overhaul,1593266207,"I do not know the ins and outs of modding and I know it’s very hard so if I suggest something beyond the realm of possibility please let me know.

I recently thought it would be cool to see a Sequel Trilogy overhaul for the game, there isn’t enough to replace everything with canon content but I have some cool fan ideas to fill the gaps and still feel authentic.

Part 1:- Overhaul the Eras

Replace all eras with Resistance and First Order. I know it’s possible to at least alter the base units because they all share the same rigs. Ideally the Resistance would replace the Cis and Rebels while the First Order replaces the Republic and Empire.

Part 2:- Map Alterations

Replace textures on wreakage with ones that resemble the Resistance logo and markings because the Resistance would use old vehicles so on PT and ST maps it makes sense to see MTT and Clone Tanks.

Part 3:- Hero Replacements

Heroes

Rey:- Jedi Leia

Leia:- Old Leia, Holdo, Rose and Zorri, Jahnna

Luke:- Old Luke

Han:- Old Han, Kazuda Xiono, Yeager

Lando:- Poe Dameron

Yoda:- Teenage baby yoda

Finn:- Clone Trooper Kix, Sidon Ithano 

Obi Wan Kenobi:- Old Ezra Bridger, Old Mando (Dark Saber)

Anakin:- Ben Solo

BB8:- CB 23

Villians

Boba Fett:- Ax Tagrin

Bossk:- Cardo 

Darth Vader:- Supreme Leader Snoke

Emperor Palpatine

Kylo Ren

Darth Maul:- Ap’ Lek

Captain Phasma:- Commander Pyre, Aligent General Pryde

General Grevious:- N-K Necrosis

Count Dooku:- Moff Gideon

BB9E

Part 4:- Reinforcement Replacement

Resistance:- Just add some weathering to the CIS reinforcements and that’s it.

First Order:- Replace Clone Commando and Death Trooper with First Order Raiders and replace Isb agent and Arc trooper with a First Order security agent. Finally replace the Clone and Imperial Jump Troopers with the old replaced First Order Jump Trooprr

Part 5:- Vehicles alterations.

Just give the Rebel and CIS vehicles a Resistance makeover and do the same with the Republic and Empire but with the First Order

These are just some dumb ideas for a sequel Overhaul mod. Do with it as you please.

75,Here's why terms like 'Dark Jedi' 'Light Sith' and 'Grey Jedi' should not exist and how they can be easily replaced,1593262774,"This is pretty straight forward. The main reason why I do not want these term to exist is because they break the logic already existing. At least I get what they are trying to say but this could have easily been avoided if these terms where re-worded to remove confusion. 

\- The Jedi are peacekeepers. They are supposed to bring balance to the force and generally maintain peace, harmony and order. The Sith are chaosbringers and bring chaos instead of peace. They choose to have war, cruelty and possible further racial and social issues. The Jedi are Jedi and the Sith are Sith. The only terms I think would actually make some sense (combined with Jedi or Sith)is Former Jedi/Sith,  Jedi/Sith Convert and wannabes (slang for draftees) though they also break logic, we get the idea. 

\- Dark Jedi. Jedi are peacekeepers and clearly Dark should not be associated. The term used is to describe fallen Jedi not sith but they are only what they are. To be honest, I think the real term should be a Dark Force user instead or a former Jedi. But please do not create oxymorons. 

\- Grey Jedi. Now I think that Star Wars is trying to create Robin Hoods. I think the concept is really cool but the name ruins it. Instead of Grey Jedi, call the a Gray Force User instead. There is also no way you can just easily resist both sides. The Dark Side was hard enough for a user and the light could be the same. The only way I guess this theory could be applied is if say the order only uses it as a tool or studies the force but it doesn't speak for the members themselves. But even that breaches logic. I guess the only real term you could use is a Free Force User.

88,"Professional writer and huge Star Wars fan checking in, anyone there?",1593257400,"Ladies &amp; gentlemen, boys &amp; girls, greetings from a fellow fan.

As stated in the title, I am a writer by trade, and I seem to be considered a fairly decent one at that. In these tumultuous times where covid19 has completely crippled the entertainment industry, I am crawling on my knees from a lack of prospective deals. Everything has ground to a halt, yet I remain optimistic and continue to create stories with a burning fervor, hoping to dazzle the studios with a multitude of top notch works when it all kicks back into gear. Hopefully. But, alas, I digress, and I apologise... What I came here to ask was;

Would anyone be interested in reading some Star Wars fan scripts that I am creating during this time in limbo? I have a tremendous amount of respect for the depth of the lore in both legends and canon and I sample from both throughout my works, though I must admit that I despise TLJ and ROS so much so that my inner fan simply cannot reconcile the fact that they're supposed to be canon Star Wars. I just... Can't. Anyway, sorry, on we go.

The first fan script, in need of an edit or two, is the only one out of three that I have completed thus far.  Its plot revolves around the Old Republic and centers on the rise of Revan, the first installation chronicling his life as a struggling, budding youngling. 

The other two scripts detail the founding of the Jedi order and the aftermath of episode six, respectively. 

I look forward to your replies fellow fans, whether the interest is there or not, and I hope you're doing well in this troubled era.
