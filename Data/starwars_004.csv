19,Now would be a great time to make a Jango Fett game,1598402504,"My quarantine time burning has led me to play through the PS4 port of Bounty Hunter. At the time it blew my, 12 year old self's mind. Nearly 2 decades later, it is... dated. Maybe it's the janky lock on, maybe it's the lack of a progression system, or the baffling lives system, but it had me hankering for a more modern Jango Fett game. And I got to thinking...  

In NuCanon we know basically nothing about Jango's backstory pre-clone template selection. We know that he's not a true Mando; that's about it. Comic's are fine, but Jango is the type of character that begs to be explored and fleshed out interactively. With The Mandalorian, we've also a few of the day to day aspects of the bounty hunting business. Chain codes, tracking fobs, pucks, etc are all mechanics that would fit perfectly into a game.  

Like the og Bounty Hunter game you set it before Phantom Menace. Maybe Jango is a rising star. Maybe he's just an average or fledgling bounty hunter. You could tell the story of how he got his armor and his reputation as the best in the galaxy. The Mandalorian (and to a lesser extent Solo) showed that people are receptive to a non-Force based, more grounded Star Wars story. We could lose the Bando Gora and pit Jango against 3 main, ongoing adversaries: Crime Syndicates, Bounties, and Mandolorians. The first 2 are obvious choices. The Mandos could act like more structured/scripted versions of the bounty hunter encounters in Fallen Order. Think about it: you really think that an honor-based warrior society would be cool with some dick parading around in a set of armor while engaging in such an undignified line of work?  

The premise of a bounty hunting game works perfectly for the level sensibility of games like Bioshock/Doom/Fallen Order/Hitman (in terms of freedom not gameplay systems). Dump the player in a big ass, semi-openworld level and go nuts. Give the player freedom to pursue their main bounty/ies while performing odd jobs or scooping up low level bounties along the way. Top that off with a progression system that allows you to shop for upgrades for your armor with your earnings. Jango starts with a basic, bare set of armor (either stolen or a counterfeit) that can be enhanced with guantlet mounted equipment, modifications, and increased protection. Obviously, he'll end up with his classic silver duds from ATOC, but there's plenty of time for cosmetic customization in the game. And of course, you'll be able to experiment with an arsenal of blasters, slugthrowers, scatterguns, disruptors... All of the NuCanon offerings could be mined as long as they're era appropriate.  

That's about it. I know it'll probably never happen. But don't tell me you wouldn't play that game.",StarWars,selfdeficatinghumor,False,/r/StarWars/comments/igotwx/now_would_be_a_great_time_to_make_a_jango_fett/

60,Stories of Light and Dark brings back a lot of legends lore about the nightsisters.,1598392936,"
Star Wars The Clone Wars: Stories of Light and Dark released today and along with it a [lore break down by marvelstarwars] (https://numidianprime.wordpress.com/2020/08/25/the-clone-wars-stories-of-light-and-dark-continuity-breakdown/). And while the book is short (being aimed at kids and told  in first person by characters) it does have something really wonderful concerning one of my favorite species in Legends. The Dathomiri. 

So some short background. From about 1997 up until TCW Dathomir (the people and the planet) were different in a very long list of ways. But most importantly was that in the rest of the EU the Nightsisters were just one small group on Dathomir. It was predominately inhabited by light side/neutral force witches with the Nightsisters being clans of outcasts who fell to the darkside. 

TCW seemed to say that the Nightsisters, along with the nightbroters, were the only ones on Dathomir and that Talzin's clan was the only clan of nightsisters. 

While Legends tried to integrate the two views as best it could canon seemed to go along with TCW's view of it being all one clan of night sisters and everyone being wiped out when Grevious attacked the planet. 

The NEU seemed to play around with the idea of if Talzin's clan was the only clan on Dathomir and if their were any other survivors (Fallen Order most obviously) but nothing execpt the non-canon FFG lore books said that yes their were other clans of nightsisters. 

Well the ""Stories of Light and Dark"" book went one step further than saying yes their were other nightsister clans on the planet. They didn't just say ""yes their are other night sister clans"" they said ""Yes their are other clans but their are also other clans of force witches as well"" 

&gt;Falta’s trinkets were sought after by clans beyond the Great Canyon, an area of Dathomir from the Young Jedi Knights books. The Misty Falls also come from the same place.

&gt;Falta collects water from the Dreaming River, which is from Nightsaber, a mini RPG adventure published online by Wizards of the Coast.

&gt;Falta also trades with a travelling witch from the Blue Coral Divers Clan, which was mentioned in Fate of the Jedi: Backlash

&gt;When interrogating Old Daka, Falta mentions the Howling Crag Clan from the Galaxies MMORPG.

Along with minor clans we have the major clans from Courtship of Princess Leia back as well as the fact that the force witches ride Rancors, which was something that was sorely missing from TCW 

&gt;Rancors are repeatedly mentioned to be native to the planet and kept by the witches. This was shown in The Courtship of Princess Leia but hadn’t cropped up in canon much until now, aside from a few sly references. The Singing Mountain and Red Hills are also from Courtship.

Also its worth mentioning that the Dathomir you see in TCW and JFO is a lot different than the one in the legends books and comics. So along with mentions of jungles and the clan names themselves the planet seems to be returning to a more historic picture. 

This makes me very happy. The force witches of dathomir have always been a one of my favorite species so its nice to have more of their legends versions back. And since I've been enjoying their NEU connection to sith sorcery and alchemy its kind of the best of both worlds now.",StarWars,TheMastersSkywalker,False,/r/StarWars/comments/igm5j3/stories_of_light_and_dark_brings_back_a_lot_of/

[Here is the link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14WydR6jh2wSwW3eFWVGCaTafKSsWn-Lq/view?usp=drivesdk)

The story begins right in the time of battle of Crait. It tells us how the whole Galaxy react to the First Order victory (or maybe lose?) over the Resistance.

Why Leia's allies didn't come to the Crait? 
How the First Order conquests the whole galaxy after (SPOILER) Snoke death? 
What secrets does the fallen Empire still hide?  
Is there anyone else who still has hope?

I tried the story to be dynamic, interesting, sometimes funny and what the most important - logical, arranged and planned. 

There might be a little grammatical mistakes so forgive me - It's only first draft.

Have fun!!!

Hayden, Ewan, and Natalie have barely aged at all and could pull off more mature characters easily; and with Samuel Jackson and Ian McDiarmid they would look more convincing as the elder characters. 

In general, this movie probably had the most potential in the franchise, yet couldn't fully utilize it in some areas.

Two nameless Jedi are speaking, and one reveals that they recently discovered that the Force is set to have some kind of ""regression"" and says that this happens on a cycle, and that they mean to tell Senator Palpatine to bolster the trust between the Jedi and the Republic. But what are they talking about? They say that it's set to happen in about 30 years (which would be about the time of the OT) but the few Jedi there don't seem to be any weaker than those in the prequels, I don't think they're referring to the empire in general because that's already established by the time of the OT obviously. So in short, I'm just pretty confused. Obviously it's also a non-canon book, so it could just not be referring to anything that actually happens.

Which works, Yoda stops and saves his friends. But wouldn't the Jedi-thing to do have been to let them die? It feels like it was Yodas attachment to them that made him save them, instead of ending the war. When Luke wants to save Han and Leia Yoda criticizes Luke and tells him that he should let go of them in order to complete his training. Something obviously Yoda couldn't do himself.

Honestly when I walked out of the theater the day of release, I didn’t know how to feel. I didn’t get a chance to see it again for a bit so I kind of sat with my initial thoughts on the movie and I just thought it was a terrible Star Wars movie. So many flaws and so many character/story directions I thought were terrible. I was basically in agreement with most of the anti-last Jedi talking points. 

But then I got a second viewing...then a third and fourth and each time I watched the movie,I found myself so invested in the story, so caught up in the moments I now see as brilliant Star Wars moments. Every time I see the movie I love it more and more and just really appreciate where the story is being taken and the risk the movie takes to give us a fresh new story. I could go on and on about how great I think the movie is. I just wish I had seen what I see now when I first saw the movie in theaters.

97,I think Obi Wan Kenobi is the greatest Jedi ever,1598336196,"Obi Wan's story is amazing, and his relationship with Maul is the greatest rivalry in Star Wars in my opinion.

Warning: Clone Wars and Rebels spoilers.

It's incredible how much suffering Obi Wan goes through and he's never swayed to the dark side. He lost Qui Gon, Satine, Anakin, and even the Jedi Order. The rivalry between Maul and Kenobi is interesting because the only one who hates the other person is Maul. Maul himself killed Qui Gon and Satine, yet Obi Wan doesn't hate him in the slightest. Obi Wan never lets his feelings cloud his judgement. The duel where Kenobi kills Maul is absolutely beautiful. Kenobi respectfully battles Maul and comforts him in his final moments. His relationship with Anakin is also great because Obi Wan is fully aware that Anakin is breaking some rules, but never stops him. In the Clone Wars we find out Obi Wan knows about Anakin and Padmé's relationship. This adds even more weight to his line during his duel with Anakin where Obi Wan acknowledges he failed Anakin by letting him be in a relationship. It makes me wonder if Obi Wan also feels responsible for the death of Shmi. The fact Obi Wan stays calm after realizing that Anakin turned to the dark side is another great Jedi trait of him. I personally feel that the only time where Obi Wan's feelings clouded his judgement was in his duel with Anakin. Obi Wan knew he had to kill Anakin, but he couldn't kill his own padawan.

He believes that the characters (not only Mando himself, but random people on all the planets they visited) should have easily recognized The Child as a member of Yoda's species.

I strongly disagree.

Because Yoda didn't directly fight or influence the Clone Wars (at least not in a way that would be broadcasted to the general public in the galaxy), I argue that no one (especially not random citizens on relatively isolated planets like Navarro or Sorgan or even Tattooine) would even *know of* Yoda let alone be able to recognize a member of his species.

Everything from its lack of explanation to the fact he came back in the first place. His story was so perfect in the PT and OT and I guess I would’ve preferred if he came back as a Force ghost or hologram. 

- hyperspace jumping. Just seemed a little flukey and unnecessary (since when can TIEs jump to light speed?)

- the lack of Anakin. I’m a huge fan of the Prequel Trilogy and bringing back Palpatine without Anakin just seemed odd. Especially considering how obsessed Kylo is with him. An appearance to either Rey or Kylo would be really meaningful. 

- the Final Order. Just seeing on the screen 100+ Star Destroyers all with the ability to destroy a planet just did not seem within grasp. 

- just in general how the ST completely ignores the Prequels. With it being the last saga film I expected much more callbacks.

34,Unpopular Opinion: Attack of the Clones is a good movie,1598320430,"So I just watched Attack of the Clones for the first time in God knows how long and have been left with one question. Why the hell is this thing hated? Sure its no masterpiece, but its entertaining, fun, original (unlike more recent installments), doesn't screw up any Star Wars lore that i'm aware of. I found it enjoyable.

Lets overlook the dated cgi and clunky dialogue and focus purely on the story. There are only two real problems. Anakin as a character and the romance subplot (tbh all my problems with the prequels can be traced to Anakin and the romance subplot, everything else is pretty solid). Anakin's character is pretty unlikeable which makes the blossoming romance feel even less believable and I hated the fact that most of Obi Wan and Anakin's relationship was just constant bickering and disrespect. I feel like their should have been a more heartfelt bond between them to give Revenge of the Sith more weight. But the story itself is decent enough that the only time the movie feels actively painful to watch is Naboo.

Luckily, the Anakin and Padme stuff doesn't go on for too long. Its only a few rough minutes of Naboo before the romance becomes a background thing that you can just ignore. The stuff on Tatooine feels like a bit of a tangent from the main storyline but its still very well done and does very well at showing Anakins character arc and brilliantly foreshadows his fall to the dark side. That bit was done well enough that Anakin being unlikeable didn't really matter. 

Everything else is brilliant. The opening chase is fun, everything with Obi Wan is brilliant, Kamino and the chase with Jango Fett is all brilliant, Dooku is a cool villain, the climax is also brilliant and seeing more jedi fighting than ever before was just something special, seeing Yoda picking up a lightsaber made me squeal, the lightsaber duels are great.

Basically, rewrite Anakins character and the Naboo stuff and I see no real issues. Anakin can be arrogant and impulsive, that's not much of a problem. But at least have him show some genuine respect for Obi Wan. Don't have him be so overly dramatic over Padme, don't have him be creepy obsessive over her. Instead have the film start with them just being platonic and let the romance develop naturally.

Instead of Naboo, have the two constantly running from danger like they're in a freaking Terminator film with the assassins constantly on their trail. Maybe after saving each others lives a few times they start admiring each others skills, respecting each other. Then in order to make Tatooine feel less like a tangent have someone intentionally go after Anakin's mother to try and force him to give up Padme to the assassins so it ties into that plot a bit more. Everything else can play out a similar way, then instead of having Anakin rant about wanting power, use it as a moment of vulnerability to draw Padme and Anakin closer together. Instead of screaming about how powerful he will become, insulting Obi Wan and bragging about murdering everyone, just have him lament about not being strong enough. Let them open up to each other and then use that moment to tease a kiss. Then they can finally kiss in the stadium later and it would feel like a natural progression. Arguably Anakin could also use a better actor but I do think Hayden gives at least a reasonable performance.

Overall, its a decent movie and I can't understand the hate for it at all.",StarWars,Jfreeman1507,False,/r/StarWars/comments/ig2x0a/unpopular_opinion_attack_of_the_clones_is_a_good/

However, the thing that makes her stand out is that throughout the events of KOTOR 2, The Exile is faced with the quiet side of conflict, the innocents suffering, the gangs that illustrate dominance because of a lack of care from the Jedi. The Exile practically starts off on a journey from Good versus Evil, but then learns that it is much more complex than that. She eventually strays from the Jedi order, but is still a servant of the light and embodies qualities of a kindness, very similar to Ahsoka. Moreover, Dave Filoni, co-creator of Ahsoka, is decently fond of the KOTOR series, particularly KOTOR 2. It might be a stretch, but I just thought it was cool that maybe Ahsoka could have been based off the Jedi Exile.

3. Clones. It shows that clones aren't just clones. First rex doesn't properly executes Krells order because in his opinion the plan is to dangerous for his brothers. Then fives hardcase do their own thing because they think it's right although they are not allowed to do it. 

4. Krell. Like Fuck Pong krell. He is an a hole BUT he is an interesting character. I won't go too much in detail because that just would be too much.

55,There is an R2-D2 lookalike in The Phantom Menace that easily could have replaced him,1598288041,"Just re-watched The Phantom Menace and noticed something really weird.

Yet when they show all the droids working on the ship, that impostor is nowhere to be seen.

Each person chooses a character and they equip items to be used in battle (many are attached to body parts: head, armor, hand).  Then ""Kick Open the Door"" to battle an Opponent, jump to a new planet with a Hyperspace card, or perhaps be cursed with a Bad Feeling card.  I've introduced space vehicles, planet-side vehicles, and the Force to Munchkin gameplay, too.  (There's a Force indicator that can affect battles and could prevent some players from claiming the winning level.)  Collect treasures, which give you weapons, protection, Force abilities, and more, until you reach level 12 and win.

17,Clone Wars is very overhyped.,1598269143,"I'll probably get mass downvotes or hate for this, because of the general attitude towards the show. 

Before I start I also want to make it clear **I DO NOT HATE THIS SHOW**. Its a good show, but not the second coming of christ it's made out to be. It's very inconsistent, with every good arc having at least 1 bad one to bring it down. 

The combat is fairly bad, with any fight including Grievous having at least 4 moments when Grievous could easily kill his opponent. This is only really the case in the first 3 seasons or so, after that the animation quality vastly increases and the fighting is smoother and generally has less opportunities in which one duelist could easily beat the other. 

Another thing is the arcs I see that are usually peoples favourites (Umbara and Siege of Mandalore) I feel are the ones blown most out of proportion. 

Umbara is always described along the lines of 'dark, gritty and a great humanization of the Clones' but I personally think there are a lot more instances where the Clones are humanized - and when it's done better too. And while it is dark and gritty, I personally don't think that makes something automatically good. 

As for Siege of Mandalore, the main problems I have with this are that it's incredibly overhyped, and that people refuse to acknowledge the flaws in it. I've seen it praised so much as 'the best piece of Star Wars by far' but its just... not. There are so many flaws within it such as Ahsoka having massive plot armour, a massive power boost since we last see her. People never address these, but then criticize these flaws in other characters. I get that Ahsoka has to appear in Rebels, but even so some of the time the plot armour is just extreme. And I've yet to see a justification as to how she's become so powerful. 

There we go. That's my thoughts. To clarify once again, I don't hate the Clone Wars, just the massive pedestal it's put on.",StarWars,DragonMaster7Zero5,False,/r/StarWars/comments/ifnbxi/clone_wars_is_very_overhyped/

93,The Rise of Skywalker and the theme of memory,1598216193,"Despite it's messy first half, One of the over-arching thematic aspect I love in TROS is that of memory.

Memories of the saga itself, with all the other films being referenced and included in various levels of the film (thematically, visually, narratively, structurally).

In the story, and in characters, you have these things all tied together:

\- Rey’s fractured memories of being left/sold on Jakku as a child as her parents left on that ship as she tries to piece together her sense of self.

\- Ben’s memory of his father Han, telling him truth after the revenant Palpatine has revealed his years of deceptions and lies.

\- Significantly, Threepio’s willingness to both sacrifice his memory to help others, whilst leaving only a translated Sith message. Later, Threepio’s memory is restored by his best friend Artoo, exemplifying both the other theme of not being alone (the “faith in your friends” the Emperor derided Luke for in ROTJ), as well as beautifully echoing the Sith/Jedi differences in terms of voices. Threepio contains millions of languages... *voices* you might say, which are replaced by the one, red-eyed Sith message voice. The Sith message is a lone, secret voice, whereas Threepio’s usual, millions of voices are restored later because he had friends.

\- The Sith version of memory is to build a one-man army in a dark spirit that then passes into another body, full of the Sith who have come before, clinging to an unnatural existence ‘cheating’ death. The power is heavy, burdened, and centred on a throne made of rock, at the bottom of a temple underground. Oppressive, secret and twisted.

\- The Jedi version of memory is a collective unconscious of enlightened voices that Rey calls upon from the stars, the Force, that surrounds us and binds the galaxy together. Open to helping anyone who will listen, harmonious to life, containing the identities of past Jedi, who accepted physical death as a natural part of life.

\- The First and Final Order... featuring Allegiant General Pryde... who remarks that as he served Palpatine/the Sith Emperor in the past, he serves him now again. The head of a navy, with a strict organisational structure, flummoxed by the eventual opposition...

\- The Resistance, yes, but also just ... ‘people’. People with memories of the Empire, like Lando, Chewie, Wedge. But also newer people like Rose, Jannah, Finn and Poe, who have all had their own journeys and memories to get to this point.

And as the film reaches its conclusion, Rey takes us back to the place the films really started, and we remember. Rey remembers her two Jedi masters, Luke and Leia. An old woman recalls that it’s been so long since anyone has been there, in a matter-of-fact manner, but we know we haven’t been there since ROTJ or ROTS, depending on which order you’re watching or considering the films.

In one direction, the ghosts of the past, memories, buried with respect and love, like the two lightsabers. In the other direction, a twin sunrise, future possibilities, accompanied by BB-8.

I can't think of two better examples of force users being torn between the light and the dark than Darth Vader and Kylo Ren. They're internal conflict was all about being caught between the two sides of the force. And, both displayed characteristics of dark/light several times... Two quick examples are when Vader killed Palpatine and when Kylo killed Snoke.

&amp;#x200B;

It seems to me that they would have purple sabers like Mace. But they don't...

&amp;#x200B;

Any input?

1,This is why obi wan looks so much older in a new hope,1598206372,"Think bout it, from episode 3 to episode 4 there is a 19 year gap. The dude looks like he aged 30 years. We all know Obi wan never turns down a drink, mah boi has partied with pirates and had his fair share of drinks at cantinas. How do you think he knew where to go to find a pilot?

So let's put ourselves in his shoes... you're entire order has been executed, your brother is know the enforcer for the emperor, know you don't live in a shiny temple in the capital of the galaxy, the love of your life is also dead at the hands of your nemesis, you live in a hut in a planet with two suns and no women.  How the hell are you not gonna drink?

We know that our boi likes his drinks, let's picture this:

he's in a cantina in Tatooine drinking his sorrows away. Some guy walks in with two smoking hot twileks by his side and says - ""hey you wanna buy some deathsticks?""- 

Our boi looks at the guy and remembers the last time he was offered drugs. He's about to reject them but he remembers his life has gone to hell, he looks at the twilek babes and takes the drugs. Next thing you know he wakes up with a Twilek, a togruta and a Wookiee after a night of partying. ""How did a wookie get here?"" he then realises that he's not in Tatooine anymore but instead he woke up in a hotel in Zeltros. And it's all a slippery solo pe from here.

When Revan and the other Jedi refused the council's orders to not join the war, they eventually turned to the dark side but out of choice rather than a fall.

6,Let's talk Jedi robes!,1598203046,"Ok...
I guess it's safe to assume, that the clothes Ben Kenobi wears in the original movie (ANH) were never meant to be Jedi robes. These kimono style tunics and the earthy colours were clearly normal Tattooine wardrobe, looking at the clothes Owen and Luke are wearing.
It's also made relatively clear that he was in hiding, so why would he wear the uniform by which to quite safely identify a Jedi?

In TESB Yoda, being another hermit, also wore some very simple dark robes. 

In ROTJ we finally have the scene with the three force ghosts, and Anakin wearing the exact same clothes as Obi-Wan.

What do you people think? Was this the point Lucas had decided to retroactively turn the Tattooine robes into a Jedi uniform?
I remember, being a little confused, the first time I watched the movie as a kid, but this thought somehow never occurred to me. I just thought: ""Well, if he's got a brother on Tattooine this is probably where Anakin grew up, too, so he's also wearing typical Tattooine clothes.""

The prequels then made it very clear that these were traditional Jedi clothes, but I still kind of doubt that this was Lucas' original intention. Not even in ROTJ. After all the concept art for TPM had the Jedi in these awesome looking black clothes with shoulder pads, that make me think that they might have toyed with the idea of making Luke's all black ROTJ outfit to be inspired by original Jedi uniforms.

Over the years I grew to like the prequels much better, but this choice of all Jedi looking like Tattooine natives always annoyed me. Ben Kenobi would have been horrible at hiding! 😅

Then the sequels came along and I was waiting for Luke in black or maybe just something different (like the clothes he finally had in TLJ!), but then he turns up at the end of TFA with his take on Republic style Jedi robes...
I was... let's say: disappointed.

So if there's one thing I wish for stories after TROS then it would be to have Rey's future Jedi (or Skywalkers or whatever) wear whatever the hell they want, as in the old EU.

General idea is the main group are a squad of kinda capable but not very effective storm troopers (galactic empire troopers) that are led by a comically inept overachieving imperial officer that's trying to climb the rank ladder as fast as possible. The main plot is them dealing with the bureaucracy of being government ""employees"" and in general just some of the empire ridiculousness.

17,Star Wars galaxy location,1598191286,"Let me state outright that this is not grounded in any canon, location of Star Wars galaxy is left intentionally vague. This is just where i envision it being.

Still i will use one bit of information we have. Star Wars movies are supposedly historic records, which somehow got to us. Since it is impossible to receive information from entities outside our observable universe i imagine wherever SW galaxy is it's inside our observable universe. In the universe of Star Wars i imagine Milky Way exists just as it exists in our own universe.

So ok, i imagine Star Wars galaxy is part of Laniakea supercluster, just like Milky way, but it is not part of Virgo cluster. Star Wars galaxy is just one of roughly 100 000 to 150 000 galaxies in Laniakea supercluster.

Which one? Well we probably have a name for it but it's not a real name, just a serial number. And that's the whole point. I like to imagine Star Wars galaxy is not in any way special, same as Milky Way. In this universe, seeing as how chock full of life SW galaxy is, i like to imagine that, if you were to peek into any of the other 100 000 galaxies in the Laniakea supercluster you would find a history just as rich and just as interesting as the one in Star Wars galaxy. 

And that's the beauty of it. Words ""Long time ago in a galaxy far far away"" always evoked a sense of vastness of space in me, that somewhere out there there is a tiny speck of light, barely worth a serial number in the catalogue for us, and yet filled with incomperhensibly vast amount of history and stories.

I will be going over the entirety of TCW, so spoilers ahead? Idk if this warrants a spoilers flair since S7 has been out for a while, but idk how to put one. It'd be cool if one of y'all could tell me how in the comments.

I remember when I was a little kid and TCW was on all the time on Cartoon Network. However, I never wanted to watch it because I didn't think it was ""real"" Star Wars like the movies were. I didn't watch the series until 2017. I didn't have an actual streaming service to watch the episodes on, so I watched them on YouTube. The actual episode only took up half the screen (I'm assuming so it wouldn't get copyrighted), and the volume was kinda low so it wasn't the most pleasant watching experience, but from the beginning I was hooked.

-There's not much to say about it. Starting this marathon soon after season 7 was released made me appreciate how much better the animation has gotten over the years.

I applaud them for taking a risk back then of bringing in a completely new character that had never been mentioned before, who was supposed to have a big impact on Anakin's life. I thought she was childish in the movie and honestly a little annoying, but then again what do you expect from a young Padawan who has a little too much self confidence and looking to prove herself?
-I love the scene where Obi Wan is having tea with the Separatist general. I thought it was funny, and perfectly embodied Obi Wan's comedic side imo.

The series:
-It's kinda slow in the first two seasons ngl. However, I also forgot how many of the more memorable episodes for me we're towards the beginning of the series. It wasn't like there were a ton, but it there were more memorable episodes than I thought there would be.
-The Mortis story arc reminded me why it was my favorite the first time I watched TCW. I've always been interested at the core of the Force and how it works, and the concept of the father, son, and daughter is cool to me.
-The Rako Hardeen arc annoys me simply because I never fully understood why they didn't tell Anakin that Obi Wan was alive after Obi Wan was safely undercover. I get that they wanted a real, raw reaction from Anakin when Obi Wan ""died"" and at his funeral and such, but it just doesn't make sense why they didn't tell Anakin sooner. I've already ranted about this with one of my friends, so I'll just stop while I'm somewhat ahead.
-I shed a few tears when Satine died that's all I'm gonna say.
-TCW made me really like Maul and now the dude is one of my favorite characters in all of Star Wars. He is really far from your typical villain, and there were times that I actually felt bad for him all while hating all the pain and destruction he caused in his pursuit for revenge.
-Dude, the Jedi Temple bombing got me mad on behalf of Ashoka and Anakin. The way the Jedi council completely turned their backs on Ashoka was just wack. It just shows how corrupted and lost they were at that point. You'll see me talking about this more when I write about ROTS, but Obi Wan. Obi Wan. My boy. My favorite character. The dude done messed up. It always seemed throughout the prequels and TCW he was torn between strictly following the Jedi code, and actually doing the right thing that a Jedi should actually do. Unfortunately, sticking with the Jedi council and code usually got the best of him and it showed big time in this arc.
-I really enjoyed the story arc with Yoda and the Whills. Like I said earlier, I really enjoy the Star Wars lore that gets to the heart of the Force's inner workings.

S7:
- Season 7 was some of the best Star Wars I've ever seen. The little subtleties throughout the season made it beautiful. Especially when Kenobi and Ashoka talked for the last time. That seen was one of my favorite scenes in all of Star Wars.
-I'm gonna mention it again, the animation is absolutely amazing. It only added to the grandness of it all. Major props to all the people who worked on this, they did an amazing job.
-It was interesting seeing how much Ashoka has grown and yet how much she still needed to figure out post-Jedi. It's a great middle ground between the little kid/young teen that she was for much of TCW and the wise woman she was portrayed as in Rebels.
-The ending scenes in episode 12 were absolutely chilling. I was feeling all kinds of emotions that I can't fully describe.

*Special note, during my rewatch of TCW, I watched seasons 5-7 with my dad and brother (who were both watching the series for the first time after a couple of years of ignoring my recommendation of it). It was great seeing their reaction, especially my little brother. It was satisfying seeing my dad change his mind about he didn't think Ashoka was necessary to really liking the character.",StarWars,NFfanSpursfan,False,/r/StarWars/comments/iewuv0/star_wars_completionist_marathon_chronicles_the/

Wouldn't they be cyborgs or something? If society is advanced enough to colonize the galaxy and invent faster-than-light travel, surely they can edit their biology???

To use another **example** ...

In Seth MacFarlane's show The Orville, seemingly nothing has changed about human biology, and yet humans are traveling the galaxy at warp speed. So we discovered / designed warp drive, but Elon's Neuralink never worked out?

30,Disney’s Diversifying of the Empire Has Undermined Part of their Evilness,1598134503,"I personally can’t handle the fact that Disney has completely missed the point of why Lucas had the Empire as all British white dudes. The fact that you never see any women, people of color, or alien species in Imperial uniforms was intentionally done to draw similarities to Nazis. They’re supposed to be menacing, racist, authoritarian, misogynistic, evil. They see themselves as superior to everything else which is why the rebels COULD be all sorts of species and creeds. They’re meant to show a better society that is being oppressed.  
Disney was so desperate to diversify that they immediately made female officers, secret Imperial alien soldiers, and included all ethnicities in their ranks. This immediately undermined what the Imperials represented under Lucas. I find it interesting that no one else ever talks about this.

80,Unpopular opinion: Watching the Star Wars movies/shows chronologically is better than release order,1598120185,"SPOILERS

I’m someone that didn’t grow up with the original trilogy so I understand those that hold them so dear. I know there’s something special about wondering about Anakin and finally getting to see it imagined on screen but watching the saga progress chronologically feels so satisfying to me. 

Recently, I decided to go back and watch all the movies/shows that were canon in order. Started with Episode 1. Watched Clone Wars and Rebels. I even watched a Jedi Fallen Order playthrough. I feel like I have such a better understanding of the events and timing of everything seeing it happen back to back and in order. 

It means more when you see Obi-Wan and he’s old and on his own. You realize how alone he must have been and how determined he likely was to fulfill his mission. He slays Maul for good and meets characters like Ezra, meanwhile Luke thinks of him as just a crazy guy in the desert. You know who Luke is when you see him and you’re excited to see him grow and become powerful. The father surprise becomes less of a shock factor moment and more of a physical tension that builds up as a watcher. Vader feels more menacing because of scenes from Fallen Order, Rebels, and Rogue One showcasing his brute strength in combat compared to his more tame portrayal in the originals. Knowing R2’s relationship to Skywalkers and so much more stuff that’s fun to see.

For me, I feel like the originals become more of a refreshing continuation on the story you know and love instead of an introduction to this vast universe with so much you want to know. If I were to introduce someone to Star Wars, I would have to recommend watching the content in chronological order. Of course that’s just my preference. 

TL;DR 10/10 recommend watching Star Wars in chronological order. Story and character arcs feel more cohesive and fun. Also satisfying seeing reoccurring characters throughout the series and observing how they change.",StarWars,iheardyouliketothrow,False,/r/StarWars/comments/iengfg/unpopular_opinion_watching_the_star_wars/

I believe it is so far removed from the two other Prequel movies that I feel as though it should have been a prequel TO the Prequel Trilogy, with the events of AOTC being relegated to Episode 1, then a Clone Wars movie for Ep 2, and Episode 3 as it is.

Obviously there are a few sequences that occur in TPM that are very important to the prequels and Saga as a whole, but these could easily be included within AOTC would arguably make that movie more interesting. Things such as establishing Anakin’s fear of losing his mother that play a big role in his temptation to the Dark Side and anything with the Chosen One (which is already convoluted in TPM)

It just feels as though the events of TPM (on the whole, such as the Invasion of Naboo) could have bee relegated to a book, released after the PT or something similar due to them being so far removed from (and I’d argue irrelevant to) the rest of the Prequels.",StarWars,OmegaRees,False,/r/StarWars/comments/iegzin/the_phantom_menace_a_prequel_to_the_prequels/

91,Why I think you should watch Episode 1 and 2 after Episode 4,1598080804,"Ok so a lot of people discuss what the best order is to watch the Star Wars movies in. A bunch of proposals have been made, including Release Order, Chronological Order, Flashback Order, and Machete Order. But I had a new idea that I think is a better order than any of these ways. My proposed order is...

&amp;#x200B;

1. Episode IV
2. Episode I
3. Episode II
4. Episode V
5. Episode III
6. Episode VI
7. Episode VII
8. Episode VIII
9. Episode IX

Let me explain why. When viewers first watch A New Hope, they are led to believe that Luke's father Anakin Skywalker was a great hero to the Republic during the Clone Wars, but then he was tragically murdered by a student who had betrayed him. What if the viewers then watch Episodes 1 and 2 with this view of Anakin? There is almost nothing that would tip them off that he is actually Darth Vader. During the Phantom Menace, Anakin is this super good-natured kind boy. You would never expect him to turn evil. During Attack of the Clones, he does show a bit more of his dark side, like when he kills the Sand People, but he still seems like a hero. You wouldn't expect him to turn evil. Then you watch The Empire Strikes Back, and the reveal of who Darth Vader's true identity is a huge shock. A much bigger shock than it would be if you just watched Episode 4. This good natured hero you just saw is actually one of the galaxy's most feared creatures. Then they watch Revenge of the Sith, and they understand how Anakin fell to the Dark Side. They wonder if the same thing will happen to Luke. They wonder if the hero they saw in Anakin is redeemable. There is much more suspense going into Return of the Jedi now. They also have much more of a reason to sympathize with Luke when he tries to redeem Vader, now that they have seen how good Vader was initially. When I first watched Episode 6, I hadn't seen Episodes 1,2 and 3, so I didn't understand why Luke was trying to redeem Vader. It seemed like Vader had done nothing but commit evil acts. Also, IMO Leia being Luke's sister makes more sense if you've already seen Episode 3. After they watch Episode 6, they can watch the sequel trilogy.

Additionally, if the viewers have only seen Episode 4 when they watch Episodes 1 and 2, they will not have seen Emperor Palpatine, so they may not realize Chancellor Palpatine and Darth Sidious are the same individual. Even when they watch Episode 5, they only see the Emperor briefly in a hologram, and he is not mentioned by name. They may think the Emperor is Darth Sidious but not Chancellor Palpatine. Once they've seen Episodes 1,2, 4, and 5, they may think that maybe the Separatists won and took over the galaxy. They knew Darth Sidious was a separatist leader, so they may think that's how he came to power.

Another reason I could see this order working is that every reference to the Original Trilogy in the Prequels can be understood if you've only watched Episode IV. Obi-Wan, Tatooine, C3PO and R2D2, the mentions of the Old Republic and of Anakin Skywalker, Owen and Beru Lars, and Jawas all appear in the prequels, and they are introduced in Episode 4. The only thing from 1 and 2 they won't understand is Yoda, but the doesn't seem like that big a deal. Yoda is not a huge character in Episodes 1 and 2.

So while I was in the Shower I was thinking about how in MY OPINION the sequel trilogy was a disappointment and I thought the EU was better even though it had some dumb stuff in there as well I enjoyed most of it. From what I've seen there is  a divide in this fan base but some people aren't part of it and just love everything for what it is I think the two sides are Prequel Fans and Sequel Fans. I think the perfect solution to this is a multiverse. Why not Have two versions of the sequels and I'm not say the new version has to be movies but a tv show like the Clone Wars. I think this could keep everyone happy because the Sequel Haters could just like the other version and the people who like the sequels could be happy with what we have now. They could release content for both versions and everyone can watch both to see how things play out differently. Most People wouldn't complain and the Fanbase would be mostly United for the first time in YEARS. It would be certainly better than ignoring the Sequels all together or making them non canon. Personally I would love to see the Thrawn Trilogy and would like to see a new Jedi Order led by Luke and Mara Jade.

61,[Movies] tros made it so I cant rewatch the movies due knowing that it all ends in nothing but tragedy,1598053802,"the utterly nihilistic and tragedy that the tros brought ruined star wars for me .

tros is the sw equivalent to got season 8 

jjerrio showed they didnt understand the actual themes of star wars which is a space fairy tale on love , hope , redemption and forgiveness not the nuremburg trials so do not give me any bs claiming ben had to die  because of his actions or that if he survived he would just end up imprisoned  this insistence that ben needed to die or that would need to end up imprisoned if he survived showed a lack of understanding of star wars themes and trying to push an idea of punitive justice rather then ben going around doing good deeds and atoning for his actions with a happy ending with rey the claim he couldnt get a happy ending  is bs

&amp;#x200B;

(and they also made plenty of other stupid decisions like ignoring tlj besides the throne scene and not building off what rian johnson built, rey palpatine retcon, undoing character development etc

[https://frumfrumfroo.tumblr.com/post/618210347830083584/in-tros-ben-1-makes-peace-with-the-legacy-of-his#notes](https://frumfrumfroo.tumblr.com/post/618210347830083584/in-tros-ben-1-makes-peace-with-the-legacy-of-his#notes)

In TROS, Ben 1) Makes peace with the legacy of his father, 2) Changes his ways and attempts to atone for his wrongdoings, 3) Selflessly gives his life for someone he loves. For a character that JJ and Terrio obviously wanted nothing to do with and shoved into a boring villain role for most of the movie, they unintentionally wrote Ben as being the exemplar of the OT’s ideas (redemption/familial reconciliation/compassionate sacrifice) while every other character acted like it was a (bad) MCU movie

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

It’s because they don’t value the OT’s ideals, so it’s fine for the ‘villain’ to embody them. These are people who have absolutely no clue what Luke’s arc was or what it was saying, they have utterly rejected his actual character and journey. They think heroism is being Born Pure, love and forgiveness are conditional on that in-born purity, and strength consists in levelling up your Force power points and how many lightsabres you can hold.

&amp;#x200B;

Also to them victory is a product of violence and power. Hate is stronger than love. That’s what this comes down to, it’s a fairy tale about the inevitable triumph of hope being hijacked by people who absolutely cannot entertain even in fiction SW’s uncompromising idealism and its statement that glory comes from compassionate self-giving not warrior prowess. Their message ends up being that Palpatine was right about everything and Luke was a naive fool whose apparent moral victory was actually just a random bit of luck that was ultimately meaningless. Anakin’s redemption is negated and denied power. Rey is a model for blind worship of authority, pragmatism, and zero personal responsibility embodying the worst, most corrupt form of the Jedi.

&amp;#x200B;

Heroes are born not made, they’re ubermensch who are just better than you, might makes right, change is impossible and no one should try to grow or improve because there’s no escape from destiny. Self-insert into our macho power fantasy of being the Perfect Heir to all your favs who gets all their coolest stuff and maxed out stats to beat up baddies who are dehumanised targets deserving only death, we will never ever challenge you again.

redemption go big or go home I had this argument like eleventy billion times before the atrocity even happened but no there is no such thing as an 'acceptable' execution of his death it is the anti-star wars it breaks the fucking myth completely irrevocably this plot could have been written by Shakespeare and it would still be bad writing because it's not a fucking stand alone it's beholden to the themes and context of the saga even if it had been executed correctly as a proper tragedy it would be a terrible ending which breaks the myth

&amp;#x200B;

bens death renders the entire saga a nihilistic shaggy dog story

That still renders the entire saga a nihilistic shaggy dog story wherein life is pointless. There’s literally no version of Ben’s death as a young man who has never been free or happy that can be anything else. He was the next generation, the life cycle is broken and Rey failed in every way as a heroine and a sw protagonist. It means the Force is malevolent and the Skywalkers were cursed playthings created only to suffer. Nothing they did had any meaning and they never had any agency.

&amp;#x200B;

I mean, sure it would make a lot more sense in the context of tros itself if they were to both die, because it makes none whatsoever that they don’t. It would bring it closer to being a viable tragedy as long as we ignore the rest of the movies entirely (which they did). It would give Rey some kind of semblance of actually being heroic in this shitshow if we established she knew she would die from looking directly at reflected evil lightning or whatever fucking nonsense. Like, if they figured out they could use the power of their connection to syphon off Palpatine’s energy but it would kill them in the process and they both agreed to do it hand in hand, that would at least have the \~dyad\~ mean something and the ‘technically defeated him using the power of love’ argument would be slightly less specious at first glance.

&amp;#x200B;

If she had made a selfless choice (or any actual choice at all) to sacrifice their happiness and belonging after finally finding it, it would still be WILDLY inappropriate for a fairy tale where love should be healing and productive, but we could almost pretend there was some kind of character arc for her.

63,My problem with Disney running Starwars is they are too stupid to fix their own mistakes.,1598053477,"I loved Starwars ever since I grew up watching it. I loved them all. Original trilogy, the prequels, and even the force awakens to a point.

The last Jedi was filled with some good idea, but also some not so good ones.

The rise of sky walker shattered me. Visually was good, but holy hell the story was trash. Even though this is true, believe it or not, they had a chance to fix this.

The Mandalorian is awesome. They do not need to go backwards in time anymore, they can continue the story forward to behonest. That's the sad part, they are too stupid to see how to do it and they let the ground work already.

The Mandalorian should end with season 3 or four when Mando is getting old and tired. Not being able to protect baby Yoda forever. But with the introduction of Ashoka, fine I can fix this. We don't need more prequel movie. But trust me if they need prequel movies I got them covered in that too.

Mando needs to run into Darth Maul, creating the need for Ashoka. However to defeat him they should also involve Cal Kestis. Let me tell you why. The game was amazing, he ran away. He was already looking to take care and raise sensitive force users. The actor who played him can literally play him in live action.

Let me now tell you how Darth Maul can be a great villain for a while. He just comes at them, and it ends overall with Darth Maul dying while Cal survives and leave with Baby Yoda. Darth Maul pupil decides to change the way things are done. He just creates a Sith order, mass expansion. Goes after Cal, and he goes into hiding until he too is old. 

Now begins the movie Rey, where she just goes on adventure and ends with an end credit scene of her sensing Cal needing her. Sequel, she find and protects baby Yoda against an onslaught of Siths. Boom, they decide to leave her alone and literally make the choice of time having to kill her.

500 years go by, middle aged Mandalorian armor wearing yoda wields the Mandalorian lightsaber. Leading the new Jedi. Omg look at that. So many possibilities now with new Jedi and Siths!!!!! Disney should hire me. I'll shit out these ideas while I literally take a shit.


And the prequels they want to do should end with Darth maul seeing his people die by the hands of the Jedi. Causing his anger and Palatine sensing him be born as a sith in that moment. Boom again. See how easy this is.

97,"""Canon Vs Legends"" Debate",1598046400,"  

There has been a lot of drama lately between current canon and EU fans. One of the things that is super frustrating is the poor understanding from the fandom on what Canon actually means. 

People have been trying to use the word canon to differentiate what means official and unofficial and that is not the correct usage of the word. Canon is a grouping of texts around a particular concept or theme. 

So, this entire “the whole EU was non canon” is an objectively incorrect statement. The EU/Legends timeline is A canon. Not non-canon. There are 3 main Canons in Star Wars. There almost like different versions of a religious text ie Old Testament/ New Testament 

1. Disney Canon/Current Canon: The OG 6 Films, TCW, R1, Solo, Rebels, Aftermath books, Mando, Sequel Trilogy, and anything else that has been made under the Disney regime. (I know Lucasfilm still makes the stuff, I just refer to it as Disney because that is when the change was made) 

2. Eu/Legends Canon: This also consists of the 6 films, along with the video games, comics and books written before Disney. Some examples would be Knights of the Old Republic, Star Wars the Old Republic, Darth Bane Trilogy, Clone Wars Multimedia Project, Thrawn Trilogy, New Jedi Order, and the Legacy comics 

3. Lucas Canon: These are the works that were a part of Georges vision and include the 6 films and seasons 1-6 of TCW

I am tired of all of this absolutism is the Star Wars fanbase. If you are going to use Canon in an argument, please use it correctly. Also do note that the EU was commissioned and owned by Lucas and that Lucas was very involved in a few parts of the EU. 

Essentially all of these are timelines. There is no correct timeline to follow as they are all a canon. IMO you should follow whatever timeline YOU like. Not what a billion-dollar corporation tells you to follow. It is also very common to mix canons together to create your own timeline. There is something in Star Wars for everyone to enjoy whether it be in a movie, a show, a book, a comic, or a cartoon.",StarWars,DarthStephan4,False,/r/StarWars/comments/ie62fa/canon_vs_legends_debate/

First off, the light side is harder to connect to than the dark side. The dark pulls you in, and as a Jedi, you must resist it. Because of this, training to be a Sith is much easier, hence why they start so much later than the Jedi.

63,Duel of the Fates symbolism explained,1598032406,"Hello! I imagine many of you have heard Dave Filoni’s monologue in *The Mandalorian Gallery* about how the Duel of the Fates is one of the most important moments in the saga. I would like to expand upon his explanation.

This first part is unrelated: Maul Wields a double-bladed lightsaber, which is new and shocking to the view, just like the Sith are new and shocking to the Jedi. With it he can fight both the Master and the Apprentice at the same time, showing how the Sith have mastered both the old ways and the new ways. 

Filoni says that the reason the fight is called what it is is because Qui-Gon is fighting Darth Maul for the fate of Anakin Skywalker. Qui-Gon represents the ideal Jedi, who is ahead of the rest of the Order, and goes against them when they are wrong. Qui-Gon is fighting so that he can be the father figure Anakin needs, because he knows the Jedi Order cannot provide this. 

This is where I’d like to add to it. Anakin is, for all intents and purposes, a Jesus allegory. He was a virgin birth, and his “father” is the very essence of the Universe, aka “The Force” or “God”. Jesus was fated to save the world with his sacrifice, similar to how Anakin was the “Chosen One” who was fated to bring balance to the Force. 

I think an important aspect of the Duel of the Fates is the physical appearance of the combatants. 

Qui-Gon is first. Jinn looks like the common Westernized depiction of Jesus, with the Robeson hair, and beard. I’m aware this is absolutely not what Jesus actually looked like, but the effect still stands. Qui-Gon’s triumph would result in Anakin becoming more like him: a perfect, idealistic Jedi Master who will bring Balance to the Force and rise above the flaws of the Order. 

Darth Maul, then, is clearly a demonic figure in The sequence. With his horns, teeth, and red face, he is clear resemblance of The Devil. He is an angry, twisted monster, corrupted and abused from childhood by an evil figure, and consumed with hatred. He is the face of the Sith in the film, and he is a visual reminder to Qui-Gon of what could become of Anakin if he’s not around to help him. Darth Maul’s triumph would result in Anakin becoming more like him: an evil, monstrous Sith who strikes fear into everyone he crosses. 

And, believe it or not, Obi-Wan is also an important aspect of the scene. Obi-Wan, as Filoni said, was not a father figure to Anakin, because he was too young and too trusting of the Council. He couldn’t give him the mentoring he needed, because he was too much like the other Jedi. And, this is reflected in *his* appearance. With his standard robes, short hair, and clean-shaven face, he looks so...basic, simple, default. Like on the character customization screen, he is the first model that pops up and is expected to be change. As an Padawan, this is appropriate, but the customizations he later receives seem like poor imitations of Qui-Gon, which I believe was also intentional, as he tried and failed to imitate his late master. Obi-Wan’s triumph would result in Anakin becoming more like him: a basic, standard Jedi Knight who is subject to the flawed teachings of the Jedi Order. 

Now, I know what you’re thinking: *All of these Fates, eventually, come true*. But, in response, I say that *none of the combatants truly died in this fight*

Obi-Wan is the most obvious. He survives with no injuries, and the fate he represents happens first. 

Darth Maul is next. He, and the fate he represents for Anakin, both return in the same way: enraged, legless, and bringing carnage through the Galaxy. It is important that he is discovered in this state by Savage Opress, who, like Anakin, was twisted by an evil figure (Mother Talzin, who herself has similarities Sidious), ends up choking the very person the submitted themselves to the evil figure in order to save, and ends up betrayed and used by the ones who trained him. He seeks answers, and finds Maul, who, as stated before, is Anakin’s fate as a Sith. Basically, Savage being cast aside by Ventress and seeking refuge in Maul equals Anakin being cats aside the The Jedi and seeking refuge in his fate as a Sith. 

In addition, Maul’s final death plays into this as well. Kenobi kills Maul by blocking the attack Maul killed Qui-Gon with. This correction of an older Jedi’s mistake (Qui-Gon represents something else here) reflects how he was correcting his own mistakes in how he trained Anakin, by defeating the personification of Anakin’s Sith Fate by doing what the older Jedi should have done. He does this literally when he helps Luke along. 

And finally, Qui-Gon also returns, but not exactly. He comes back, not even as a ghost himself, to save Yoda and Obi-Wan from true death. Anakin does the same, by coming back at the last minute to save Luke from death, knowing that he can’t partake in life afterwards, but he can at least die knowing Luke will make the Galaxy better. He “Gave Luke back to the Galaxy”, to quote the TROS novelization when Ben did the same for Rey. When Vader does this, he, as Filoni said, “Became the father figure Qui-Gon wanted to be for him.” He does this by, like Qui-Gon, going against what the old Jedi commanded, by holding on to his attachments. He learned this from Luke, who spared Vader against the advice of Obi-Wan and Yoda. 

Footnote 1: I know that a lot of this is from cartoons which were not in Lucas’s head when he wrote TPM, but I just want to appreciate how everything flows together. 

Footnote 2: I don’t think Palpatine returning ruins this at all. He just represents the concept of evil in Star Wars, and evil will always exist, prophecy or not. Vader fullfulled his arc by saving Luke, Palpatine’s death was a side-effect.

From what we learned in TFA, the New Republic had focused their military strength into their fleet, (rather than ground forces) building a large number of ships, and keeping pilots trained and ready for conflict. 

In the OT, the Rebels were always the underdogs: In any battle, they always had far fewer ships, and focused more on using small, fast fighters. Even at the end of RotJ, with every ship they had, they were vastly outnumbered and outgunned. The only time it was a somewhat even fight was in Rogue One, and that was mainly a delaying action. In the Prequels, the CIS and Republic were far more even, but we only got to see one major conflict between them, the Battle of Coruscant, which was amazing.

We can argue a lot about the Sequels, but no one can deny that they had amazing CGI. It would have been really cool to see a full scale naval battle between the First Order and New Republic fleets.

And finally, Palpatine when talking to Cody says the time has come, as if it had been planned a while ago, not as if it were just a written order for an unlikely case, as if they had been warned not long ago that it would surface.

29,"Rise Up, Rebels: A Call For The Theatrical Cuts",1598012150,"While fan preservations like Despecialized and 4Kxx are amazing, they shouldn’t have to exist. The original Star Wars films are sitting in a vault waiting to be released. There is no excuse for Disney deny us these historical artifacts. There is no reason both the Special Edition &amp; Theatrical Cuts couldn’t live side-by-side. 

I gave the reasons Disney needs to #ReleaseTheOriginalTrilogy in [my WIRED article](https://www.wired.com/story/put-original-star-wars-on-disney-plus/), now we need to make the demand known. We need to be loud. It will happen, but only if we stand together. Never give up hope that this film history will be preserved for the future.

Release the theatrical versions of the originals! Release the theatrical versions of the prequels! Release the 3D conversions of the 2019 Saga Editions! Release the 1997 Special Editions! There’s so much content that the fans would be ecstatic to have that are sitting on a shelf.

George Lucas doesn’t own the movies anymore. I refuse to believe the rumors that Disney would sign a contract that would deny them such an obvious revenue stream. If fans could convince Warner Brothers to fund a directors cut of a superhero movie that didn’t exist, fans can convince Disney to release the [Academy Award-Winning](https://starwarsviscomp.wordpress.com/2019/11/26/list-of-academy-awards-for-the-original-trilogy/) versions of the movies that literally changed how people made and experienced movies and are currently sitting on a shelf. 

Your parents deserve to see the version they saw in theaters. Your kids deserve to see the original phenomenon. We deserve the option to choose what we want to watch.

All compounded by years in the making, from 1977 to today. Through books and comics and movies and TV. And we get to see a series devoted to him?

I know a lot of people love them but let's be honest there's stuff that we all could do without. Maybe change the age gap between Anakin and Padme in Phantom Menace.

Even though I did enjoy the new films, I understand how her decisions and creative involvement worsened the outcome, as far as I am informed.

But in my perception, there has been a weird shift in opinion about George Lucas. I remember when the Prequels (which I also enjoyed, but understand their flaws) were considered bad. When fans where begging Lucas to stop his constant reworking of the OT, because he made them worse with every iteration. Also I recall that a lot of people were applauding his separation from the franchise when Disney bought it, because even though he is a great world-builder and visionary, he just wasn’t a good writer and director by popular opinion.

And now, that he returns to the franchise, everyone seems to be excited. I don’t understand this. I get the hype about Jon Favreau. But celebrating George Lucas’ dethroning Kathleen Kennedy is just... odd. Am I missing something? Is there an explanation, that I didn’t come across?

5,Would anyone support different genres of Star Wars movies being made other than the traditional epic sagas?,1597950219,"Now that the skywalker saga is complete, why don’t they open up a little bit to try some different types of movies/series? I know I may be asking for trouble here, but I think now is the time for them to experiment a little with the massive universe. I’m not recommending that they just turn everything into Star Wars so that there are 5 Star Wars movies every year, but I was thinking if they treat Star Wars sort of like marvel, they can space them out a movie (or two if they are different enough) per year and not flood the market while giving each project time for proper planning, production, etc. it would also make it relatively easy to abandon or shelf something that just doesn’t work, while opening up the universe to tons of directors to make their own Star Wars movie without getting bogged down in a 3/6/9 movie saga if they don’t want to. I’m sure people would love to see these big directors take the reins to a Star Wars movie without the restrictions of an ongoing continuity.  

1. A Jedi buddy cop movie/series where two bumbling Jedi are sent to solve minor problems to keep them out of the larger conflicts, but always end up getting into trouble and having to get rescued. This would allow for cameos by big names rescuing or helping them. The existing universe would allow for endless interactions, and we haven’t seen much comedy or ever seen much of lesser/failed Jedi. Maybe at the end of every movie/season, the Jedi are either killed off or finally promoted to make room for a new pair? 

2. The birth of the force. I’ve always wanted them to do a movie about how the first Jedi/sith learned to harness and use the force. I know I may divide people here, but in my mind it would be a zach snyder directed samurai movie shot in a similar style to Sin city. Not exactly, but mostly black and white, with some colors (mostly red/blue/green) popping in places for emphasis. Small samurai village setting with lots of nature, wind, snow, trees, etc. The screen would just be dominated by nature compared to most of the Star Wars movies we’ve had that are overwhelmingly industrial cgi or harsh natural settings. The big reveal trailer scene would show the main characters, 2 brothers, dueling at night in tall grass with a full moon. As they trade blows in the even match, they start talking and taking verbal jabs at each other until one loses his cool and takes a much harder swing, knocking his brother back and sending a shockwave through the grass, brother that got pushed has wide eyes, brother that pushed has slight red/yellow tinge in his just long enough to wonder if it was even there. Fade to black, ‘the force is born’ fades on to screen. Goosebumps had by all. That would set up the light/dark struggle of what to do with their powers as they continue to get stronger. One brother says protect the villages, the other says to conquer. 

3. Lastly, one that’s probably made the rounds many times, but now seems like the perfect time for it. Give us a dang movie that’s just non stop, over the top force powers and battles. I’m talking many Jedi v many sith and getting into the lore of the different lightsaber styles and techniques. Basically, the force unleashed game levels of force usage, whether you want to use the same story of a vader secret apprentice or not. Give me Jedi crumpling up AT-STs and tossing them aside, snatching tie fighters out of the air, sith force choking and lightning-ing entire squads of troops, and intricate lightsaber duels of all kinds, complete with dismemberment. Not saying mortal kombat style fatalities, but we should see more than a few hands/legs getting separated. 

I know these wouldn’t fit into the existing continuity, canon issues, blah blah blah. But since the skywalker saga is complete, now would be the perfect time to get a little more creative. Also, our visual effects are finally where we can really get into these force powers and space battles more so than just mind tricks and slow sword swinging.",StarWars,eatfreshguy407,False,/r/StarWars/comments/idgjq3/would_anyone_support_different_genres_of_star/

After the PT we never see how torn Anakin is beneath the dark shell of Vader and when Anakin turns back to the light in ROTJ there weren’t too many hints. 

With Kylo Ren and Adam Driver’s great performance, we get to see the darksider beneath the mask struggle with the choices and evil deeds he’s made, something we never saw with Anakin/Vader. 

That is why to me, the ST is essential to the Star Wars story. It fleshes out Anakin’s legacy in the sense that it shows us the struggle of being on the dark side more so than any other trilogy and of course we see it through his grandson.  

When we finally get to TROS and the amazing duel on the wreckage of the Death Star 2, Ben Solo’s redemption is earned more so than Anakin/Vader’s. In the previous two films we see clear cracks in the Kylo Ren persona: the killing of his father split his spirit to the bone in TFA and he couldn’t fire on his mother in TLJ. 

In ANH and TESB - Vader was unquestionably evil. By the time ROTJ comes around Vader says “It is too late for me, son” to Luke and stays quite evil right up until his turning point when he picks up the Emperor and throws him down the shaft. 

Also, I am in no way disrespecting the OT because it’s my favorite trilogy out of the three and Vader’s turn comes as a complete and satisfying surprise. However, as a Star Wars fan I can see why the ST is valuable and provides more insight into the struggles of the dark side in a galaxy far, far away.",StarWars,skywalkinondeezhatrz,False,/r/StarWars/comments/idg1jf/the_st_is_essential_to_the_saga_because_of_kylo/

His question was ""Why does the force push/choke/move power only work sometimes when Jedi fight against Sith/inquisitors/etc.?  If Darth Vaders Force Choke is so strong, why not use it right away when fighting a Jedi?""

I told him that each Jedi/Force user is focused in battle and can 'block' the force attack from his opponent if just used right away.  However, they have to be in a period of disadvantage to use it.

19,The Story of Purple Lightsabers,1597919308,"I’m sure on some level this has been discussed but I feel the need to question a bit the narrative we’ve all heard about Mace Windu and his purple lightsaber.

I am NOT claiming that the story is false or that moment in the making of didn’t happen (obviously it did), I just think there might be more to the story.

I find it interesting that, with all the world building and control over the series, that by Episode II something seems to have changed or back tracked. 

I was in a store for my birthday and they had a lot of the Episode 1 toys and I was a bit amused to see Mace Windu packaged with a blue lightsaber (obviously predating Samuel L Jacksons conversation). But then I looked around and was ... well... shocked to see both Ki Adi Mundi AND Saesee Tiin were packaged with Purple Lightsabers!

Not to mention Adi Gallia packaged with what I’ve now learned was a crimson lightsaber!

Was LucasFilm playing fast and loose with this at the time? We’re led to believe that in Episode II, Samuel L Jackson asking for a purple lightsaber was so novel an idea and yet in the film centric merch / world building, here are two members of the Jedi counsel who had purple and one with red!

So yeah, chances are he survived that bit of lightning as well^^

And at this point he has mastered the power to prevent his own death, so I guess the Jedi were wrong and you really can survive everything?🤔

Maybe they'll throw him into a black hole when they bring him back for episode 12 after they killed their main antagonist in episode 11, surely he won't survive that, right?",StarWars,Morriganus,False,/r/StarWars/comments/id7naa/palpatines_fate_and_eventual_return_again/

I'd genuinely forgotten how much deeper in to the story it goes and how the motivations and thoughts of the Jedi, the Senate, Palpatine and Anakin are more thoroughly explored and explained. 

Some examples being:

- Anakin's real motivation for wanting to be a Jedi Master and how it connects to Padme

- How Anakin has been nominated to be on the Jedi Council/promoted to Master several times and who is alleged to have stopped his appointment

- Who Mace Windu believes to be Darth Sidious and why it can't be Palpatine

- What Dooku believes to be the real motivation in Sidious turning Anakin to the Dark Side 

One of my favourite parts has to be the discussion of the ""Chosen One"" prophecy and how the Jedi interpreted it. I know this is briefly mentioned in the film however, the conversation indirectly predicts how Darth Vader/Anakin and Order 66 will fulfill it and also how there may be ""too much light"" in the Force at present.

I'd highly recommend reading through it at least once. The film itself is already a classic but the book just adds another dimension to the story.",StarWars,supergodmasterforce,False,/r/StarWars/comments/id6y9n/are_you_growing_impatient_waiting_for_the_release/
35,Something I realized after I just got done re-watching episode I The Phantom Menace,1597914435,"          I just rewatched the phantom menacli and realized something. Remember how master Yoda was warning Qui-gonn and Obi-wan not to train Anakin because he ""senses grave danger in his trainings""? Well if they had listened to Yoda, Anakin would have never become a jedi. This means he would probably return home to Tatooine. Because of this, he would never see Padmé ever again. Since Anakin and Padmé had Luke and Leia, they would have never been born. Because Luke played a crucial role in the Rebel Alliance's victory against the Empire during the Galactic Civil War, the Rebel Alliance would have probably lost the war had Luke not been born. 
          All of this means that, although Yoda was right about there being grave danger in Anakin's training,  if Qui-Gonn and Obi-Wan listened to Yoda, that would have caused a domino affect leading up to the Rebel Alliance loosing the Galactic Civil War.",StarWars,MrBanana13,False,/r/StarWars/comments/id6ve9/something_i_realized_after_i_just_got_done/

55,The Last Jedi is the battle of the North Cape,1597901135,"A common complaint I hear about TLJ is how unrealistic or boring The chase scene is, which got me thinking, what were they going for there? And I think I found a dang near perfect parallel, very similar a to the Malevolences comparison to the Bismarck.

Now, I’m not totally informed on this, I don’t know all the details or all the names of the ships involved but essentially the German Battlecruiser Scharnhorst was dispatched under light escort to intercept an alleged convoy in the arctic/North Sea, along the way, I forget how, but her escorts are detached or are lost. Scharnhorst continues alone in the dead of night until a surprise salvo from King George? I think, rackets her at close range and does some serious damage, The alleged convoy was actually a trap for Scharnhorst, Scharnhorst was still a lot faster than the British so she turns away and a slow chase ensues, I believe until Scharnhorst’s engine and Radar suffered damage from Belfast? I believe. Admiral Bey then turns his ship around, knowing there was no hope of escape, and plunged right back into the British force, in a truly epic kinda way. (It was the Duke of York, my bad)

Now This has some very interesting parallels with TLJ, the Raddus is sent off with a small escort fleet to (presumably) go find resistance allies and a new base, along the way, she loses her escorts, stumbling into a massive First Order attack that cripples the ship from the get go, a slow chase then ensues where the Raddus puts her only remaining advantage, speed, to use as the First Order stays right on her heels, after exhausting her options (fuel, in this case) her Admiral decides she’ll go down fighting and swings the ship around and plunges right back into the enemy, in an epic moment of sacrifice.

Now that I’m thinking about it, it’s a very interesting analogy, especially since this time, the Germans are being represented by the “good guys”. I think it provides some intriguing historical perspective on the whole chase of TLJ and makes me appreciate That movie even more.",StarWars,UHammer45,False,/r/StarWars/comments/id4ej0/the_last_jedi_is_the_battle_of_the_north_cape/

I'd say watching the movies in the order of 1,4,2,5,3,6 (Phantom Menace, A New Hope, Attack of the Clones, Empire Strikes Back, Revenge of the Sith, Return of the Jedi) would only enhance stories, mysteries and the plot twists.

Think about it, we would be introduced to the the Republic and Jedi Order in the first movie. Flash forward to ANH, the empire has taken over, the jedi are gone, and Obi Wan tells Luke that the pod racer kid from the first movie grows up to be a legendary jedi, have Luke, and then get slain by Darth Vader. Jump back to AotC and things are starting not to add up, love is forbidden for the Jedi and can Luke's father really be as great as Obi Wan made him seem in ANH? He seems to be doing some very questionable things. Empire Strikes Back happens and suddenly the story is clicking into place.

They were both slaves under Watto. Then Qui-Gon finds him, and the rest is history. I guess Anakin had looked up to Qui-Gon in a father figure way during their brief time together.. then Anakin almost had this with Obi-Wan, but it was more of a brother type bond. Anakin and Palpatine sort of had this which is kind of how he was able to manipulate him I suppose. 

But what if things were different? 

\*Let's create his father: John Skywalker. John is a slave with a gifted mind for engineering and building things, with a rogue nature. He is a blond tall, proud, and strong man. Imagine him played by Armie Hammer. 

**SCENARIO:** Anakin is not born of immaculate conception. He is born to Shmi and John Skywalker . They are both slaves working under Watto, but want more for their son. Anakin still has his immense force potential. Shmi helps in her normal capacity, while John and Anakin are both gifted engineers helping around the shop.

51,"KOTOR, Mandalorians, and what I think would be a cool next phase of the Star Wars Saga!",1597870248,"The Mandalorian is probably Disney’s most successful attempt at a new Star Wars story that everyone is on board with. People have loved Mandalorians since Boba Fett showed up in the Holiday Special and in kids’ mailboxes.  So I think it would only be natural to use this as the pivot point for the Saga going forward.

To cleanse the palette, I think the next big movie trilogy should be Knights of the Old Republic. Maybe it already is, maybe Disney has something totally different in mind. Who knows? This isn’t really speculation on what’s actually going to happen. Obviously this all isn’t actually going to happen. I just think it would be cool.


So Knights of the Old Republic--that is to say, the story of Revan’s redemption. First film starts on the Endar Spire, then the rest takes place almost exclusively on Taris. Bastila is the titular Knight in this one since Revan will spend the movie thinking he’s a normie. But by the end of the film it becomes clear to Revan that the Force is with him/her (especially because of the shared dreams with Bastila) and we end on Dantooine with Revan being accepted for training.

All the while, there’s talk of the Mandalorian War and their crusade to conquer the Republic from Canderous; but only as it pertains to Revan’s story. Things are only vaguely referenced, like in the OT whenever anyone talks about the Clone Wars or things that happened in the past. 

Meanwhile, on The Mandalorian show, they are also touching upon the Mandalorian War and going into more details about what happened as it pertains to the story they’re telling on the show. The movies and the show are synergizing. 

Next movie opens with Revan blazing through his training and then he/she and Bastila realize they’ve been having visions of the star map on Dantooine. They go through the trial to reach the map, realize they’re following Darth Revan’s path, and that there is another map on Moraband. Against the council’s wishes, the group sets off for the Sith homeworld. Before they get there, however, they are captured by Malak’s fleet and before they can escape it is revealed that Revan is Revan. Revan is forced to leave Bastila behind. Now Revan has to infiltrate Moraband knowing that the Jedi and Bastila were lying to him/her and that she/he’s already fallen to the dark side before. Jedi way. Reevan finds the star map, but not without falling into his/her old bad habits. Revan has the location of the Star Forge, but is conflicted about what he/she is going to do when they get there. Movie ends with the crash onto the Rakata world.

The Mandalorian continues to follow the thread of restoring the Mandalorians to greatness. Some Mandos want to become crusaders again. Din is conflicted, much like Revan.

Last movie, the crew have to get into the Rakata temple by going through the old Mandaloian crusaders who have been marooned there and don’t know the war is over. In the temple Revan is confronted with a holocron he made of himself as Darth Revan and it continues to try to persuade him to take back control of his empire. They discuss how the Jedi and the Republic need to be brought in to take the Star Forge, but holocron Revan wants real Revan to turn on them after they win and take the chance to crush them once and for all. Then it's off to a rendezvous with the Jedi and the Republic to plan the assault on the Star Forge. The Jedi and the Republic agree to commit a significant part of their forces to the battle while Revan and company infiltrate the Forge, rescue Bastila, destroy Malak, and shut down the Forge. Revan and co find Bastila, but she has fallen to the dark side and become Malak’s apprentice. Revan defeats Bastila and spares her. She realizes the folly of her ways and comes back to the light, urging Revan not to make the mistake she did. Big fight with Malak. Revan reveals that he’s chosen the light over the dark and defeats his old apprentice. Star Forge is destroyed and everyone lives happily ever after.

Or, you know, something like that. I didn’t really mean to get that into the weeds with the actual plot of each movie, though I wanted to share how I felt you could break the story of one game into three movies. I left out a ton of details because most people know the story and the characters. It's all there in some form unless I specifically mentioned otherwise. Like, Jolee still joins up somewhere, even though we don’t go to Kashyyyk. 

After this, maybe they do KOTOR 2 as a trilogy or whatever. The Mandalorians tie into that too and it gives more real time to pass before we get to the next part of the plan: continuing the Saga past the Sequel Trilogy.

So a decade or so has passed, roughly as long as it's been in real time, since the defeat of Palpatine and the First Order. The galaxy is in a rough place. There is no real centralized government. The New Republic exists in small form, but hasn’t really reasserted itself in the galaxy. Mostly everyone is experiencing what it's like to do their own thing. Planets are enjoying a lot more freedom and independence, but at the cost of security. Warlords, pirates, and organized crime run rampant. Master Rey Skywalker and her dozen or so Jedi, including her apprentice Adolescent-Yoda, are only able to do so much. More successful against the vile forces of the galaxy have been the Mandalorians, who go larger in number as they successfully liberate the systems of the Underworld and bring security and prosperity to the inhabitants of these worlds who only need to pledge fealty to the new Mandalore and its new crusade to establish dominance. The Mandalorians quickly go from the saviors of the galaxy to a threat to anyone willing to oppose their way of life. And when they transform from liberators to conquerors, the galaxy will have to find a way to reunite if they stand any chance to oppose an unrelenting force that had only previously been brought to heel with the might of Sith empires….

TLDR: They should do KOTOR as a trilogy, synergize the Mando aspects with The Mandalorian show, and then do a current timeline trilogy about a new Mandalorian War.",StarWars,Murray85,False,/r/StarWars/comments/icw4wt/kotor_mandalorians_and_what_i_think_would_be_a/

55,A New (Republic) project,1597870029,"

So I’ve been slowly improving my technical drawing skills and will soon move on to drawing some 3D ships. I’ve had ideas bouncing around the back of my head for what to do story-wise in the 34 years between ep.6 and ep.7, and I’ve come up with the following story synopsis.

***Spark Squadron***

*As the New Republic settles in to its new, smaller galactic role, a new entity is created to test and experiment the newest in New Republic technology., designated Spark Squadron, the new unit serves well in its role until an inexplicable rise in galactic crime occurs in the southern systems, with resources already stretched by the beginning  of demilitarization, Spark Squadron is detached with the finest in New Republic tech to determine just what is causing the crime rush, put a stop to it, and more importantly, find out just what’s going on in the unknown regions...*

I’m hoping my skills can be refined enough to put out a semi decent looking comic strip for this, but that’s a long way coming. I’d love to hear your thoughts on the synopsis, and what you’d like to see out of a story like this, supposed to be set in about 9-10 ABY, corresponding generally to the Mandalorian.",StarWars,UHammer45,False,/r/StarWars/comments/icw2d7/a_new_republic_project/

73,"As much as I love the sequels, I think I can pin point two real issues where it went wrong",1597867103,"Getting the most obvious out of the way, the death of Carrie fisher really messed up the trajectory of the sequels.

And again, let me reiterate that the films are not more important than the hole her death left for her family. 

Secondly,  the true mistake of the sequels was ending 7 on a cliffhanger. This one choice completely threw off the pacing of the entire trilogy. It meant that Ep 7 and 8 essentially became Ep7 part 1 and 2 while Ep9 became Ep 8 and 9 crammed together. Had they simply had the courage to just leave Luke for the second film (based  on the story they were trying to tellstor) it would have allowed for the breathing room and off screen development weve always had between chapters.

I think there's a lot of potential for something like this as a live-action series, with hour long one-shot stories with a high production value (kind of along the lines of Black Mirror). 

Stories will take place across different eras of Star Wars showing you different facets of life around the galaxy, building upon existing lore/legends. Maybe there will be a few character cameos here and there. One episode will take you right in the middle of the Clone Wars, the next might take you to the formation of the First Order and so on.

28,The Close Up Shots of The Last Jedi,1597854662,"[Album Here](https://imgur.com/a/naJLLXQ)

One thing I always noticed about The Last Jedi, is the use of the close up. Close up shots, and extreme close ups are nothing new to film making (or Star Wars), but when I think of this movie, some of the images that first come to mind are the signature close up shots (along with the wide shots in the throne room and Crait) 

I made a collection of my favorites close ups, but honestly, the whole thing is mostly inspired by this one image [here](https://imgur.com/P8rZFtk). 

This is an outstanding shot, it's so visceral. Mark's face is taking up a majority of the frame; you see every nook and cranny of an old master's face, and Mark absolutely kills it with his look. The audience can read so many emotions in this one frame, between the redness of his eyes and the slight little crook of a smile. Sadness, contentment, fatigue, joy, it's all there; that one frame is stunningly complex. 

The film is full of these centered, close up shots, but the ones with Luke take the cake. I included more than just the centered close ups, because so many of them are great. 

Other favorites definitely include [this shot of Rey](https://imgur.com/qBtL0Z3), [Artoo](https://imgur.com/f1k5MZX), and [""Please""](https://imgur.com/eoBkXx5)

I've got to give credit to https://starwarsscreencaps.com/ for the images. Outstanding work.

It not only adds so much to the prequels, but with the addition of Maul in Solo and Ahsoka (and maybe Rex) and Bo Katan in The Mandalorian, it really is necessary to watch it in order to understand a lot moving forward.

So the point of agreeing it’s essential viewing is so that new Star Wars fans don’t disregard it as they start to dive in, or put it off until they realize they need to watch it to understand The Mandalorian or whatever else. So they know that if they want to get into Star Wars, if they have an interest past casual viewing, that they know it’s essential.

94,The Jar Jar and Ewok problem,1597831295,"While Jar Jar was design to bring some comic relief to the rather hard story, the Ewoks were design to appeal to a young audience.

Both were squished into a role simply made for the ""hahas"" and ""oohs"" and are loosing their credibility in the process.

Meanwhile, both could have been a great addition to the movies. Let's take a look:

Jar Jar as an exiled chatacter. Completely lost without his tribe and their structure. Needs to face reality outside of his safety space. He succeeds and manages to unite two races on the planet. His knowledge of the outside world and his previous encounter with the extraplanetary enemy makes him a perfect leader in the war.
But his success and his inexperience in politics makes him the perfect puppet of the emperor. He does not need to be a Sith (Dark Jar Jar) for that, just a general/politician with rising ambitions.

The Ewoks are portrait as a sort of Vietcongs of the Imperiun and it is an interesting role. The advanced Imperium struggles to adapt to harsh conditions and their technology is partially useless there. Meanwhile, the Ewoks are familiar with the environment and manage to outsmart the Stormtroopers.
It ist just not believable that you manage to conquer planet after planet if you struggle against some teddy bears with a stick. Sure they didnt need to win the war, just the battle, but still. Just imagine a race of great warriors harded through their environment and prepared for an intruder, desperate to go all in in this battle. This would justify the complete surprising of the Stormtroopers which have not anticipated such a strong resistance. 

So both of these character/characters have an interesting background. They are also really relevant for the story, but both are portrait as a counterpart for the rather brutal story in order to appeal to an (
inexisting audience.

11,George Lucas on attachment and greed,1597823380,"In a few discussions, I've found myself invoking quotations from George Lucas on the idea of attachment and how it relates to the Jedi, and I thought that this needed to be a topic in its own right.

This is an excerpt from the commentary to *Attack of the Clones:*

&gt; This is obviously a very pivotal scene for Anakin because this is reuniting with his mother and his youth and at the same time dealing with his inability to let go of his emotions and allow himself to accept the inevitable. The fact that everything must change and things come and go through his life and that he can't hold onto things, which is a basic Jedi philosophy that he isn't willing to accept emotionally and the reason that is is because he was raised by his mother rather than by the Jedi. If he'd have been taken, you know, in his first year and started to study to be a Jedi, he wouldn't have this particular connection as strong as it is and he'd have been trained to love people but not to become attached to them. But he has become attached to his mother and he will become attached to Padme and these things are, for a Jedi, who needs to have a clear mind and not be influenced by threats to their attachments, a dangerous situation. And it feeds into fear of losing things, which feeds into greed, wanting to keep things, wanting to keep his possessions and things that he should be letting go of. His fear of losing her turns to anger at losing her, which ultimately turns to revenge in wiping out the village. The scene with the Tusken Raiders is the first scene that ultimately takes him on the road to the dark side. I mean he's been prepping for this, but that's the one where he's sort of doing something that is completely inappropriate.

This is a quote someone produced from *The Making of Revenge of the Sith:*

&gt; ""No human can let go,"" Lucas would say of this scene (where Anakin seeks Yoda's counsel). ""It's very hard. Ultimately, we do let go because it's inevitable; you do die and you do lose your loved ones. But while you're alive, you can't be obsessed with holding on. As Yoda says in this one, 'You must learn to let go of everything you're afraid to let go of.' Because holding on is in the same category and the precursor to greed. And that's what a Sith is. A Sith is somebody that is absolutely obsessed with gaining more and more power - but for what? Nothing, except that it becomes an obsession to get more."" 

&gt; The Jedi are trained to let go. They’re trained from birth. They’re not supposed to form attachments. They can love people – in fact, they should love everybody. They should love their enemies; they should love the Sith. But they can’t form attachments. So what all these movies are about is: greed. Greed is a source of pain and suffering for everybody.

This is a quote from an ['oral history' posted on starwars.com as a sort of retrospective for *The Phantom Menace:*](https://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-episode-i-the-phantom-menace-oral-history)

&gt; People have a tendency to confuse it — everybody has the Force. Everybody. You have the good side and you have the bad side. And as Yoda says, if you choose the bad side, it’s easy because you don’t have to do anything. Maybe kill a few people, cheat, lie, steal. Lord it over everybody. But the good side is hard because you have to be compassionate. You have to give of yourself. Whereas the dark side is selfish.

&gt; The thing about Anakin is, Anakin started out as a nice kid. He was kind, and sweet, and lovely, and he was then trained as a Jedi. But the Jedi can’t be selfish. They can love but they can’t love people to the point of possession. You can’t really possess somebody, because people are free. It’s possession that causes a lot of trouble, and that causes people to kill people, and causes people to be bad. Ultimately it has to do with being unwilling to give things up.

&gt; The whole basis here is if you’re selfish, if you’re a Sith Lord, you’re greedy. You’re constantly trying to get something. And you’re constantly in fear of not getting it, or, when you get it, you’re in constant fear of losing it. And it’s that fear that takes you to the dark side. It’s that fear of losing what you have or want.

&gt; Sometimes it’s ambition, but sometimes, like in the case of Anakin, it was fear of losing his wife. He knew she was going to die. He didn’t quite know how, so he was able to make a pact with a devil that if he could learn how to keep people from dying, he would help the Emperor. And he became a Sith Lord. Once he started saying, “Well, we could take over the galaxy, I could take over from the Emperor, I could have ultimate power,” Padmé saw right through him immediately. She said, “You’re not the person I married. You’re a greedy person.” So that’s ultimately how he fell and he went to the dark side.

So here, we have an explanation for the Jedi philosophy and rule of no attachments - attachments are problematic because they bring with them the fear of loss, and fear, as we know, is a path to the dark side. This can be a problem for a Jedi if they have attachments that they are in fear of losing, as Anakin was - they are susceptible to fear. When that loss inevitably occurs, because all things pass, a person can be overcome with emotion, and unbridled negative emotions can not only lead to destructive behaviour, they are a path to the dark side. 

Then there is the idea that as a monastic order, the Jedi renounce attachment, possession, and materialism in the name of studying the Force and service of others. This isn't much different to real-world monastic orders, including but not limited to Shaolin monks and the mediaeval military orders of knights.

Remember that Yoda says in *RotS* that ""attachment leads to jealousy. The shadow of greed, that is."" Jealousy is a form of fear of loss - fear of not having or of missing out, which leads into greed, another key theme for Lucas. The Jedi aim to be selfless, so greed cannot be part of the picture. To be clear, it's not about not loving or not having compassion - it's about *not getting attached,* especially when that attachment becomes possessive.

I used to think that attachments were not allowed by Jedi because they can elicit strong emotional reactions where a Jedi seeks to control their emotions and not be overcome by them - as it turns out, I was only partly right. Lucas said in the commentary to *AotC* that a Jedi ""needs to have a clear mind and not be influenced by threats to their attachments."" For a Jedi to be focused on their duty, they need to be level-headed and not be worrying about something else. If they have an attachment that they're concerned about, they'll be constantly preoccupied with it. We see this happen twice in *AotC:* when Anakin goes to Tatooine to find Shmi, despite being ordered to stay on Naboo with Padme, and when Padme falls out of the gunship on Geonosis, with Anakin being willing to forego a chance to catch Count Dooku to go back for her.",StarWars,Vanquisher1000,False,/r/StarWars/comments/icjdim/george_lucas_on_attachment_and_greed/

But for some reason I never watched any of the sequels.   Not a single one, nor did I ever go back and watch the original... Until tonight :).   

43 years later and I decided it was time.   This movie made an impression on me at 10 years old because as I watched tonight, it was very familiar in a big way.   

It's interesting to look at the movie as a possible one and done too.    What I mean is... The acting isn't superb or anything.  It's really a bit of a hokey movie.    If Lucas hadn't gotten the proper financing on the movie I think it could have easily slipped into a cult classic category, but nothing more.    With all the great special effect though (for '77 anyway)... the movie was so much more.   Hard off to Lucas for such rich story telling and great creativity.   Really glad that the characters moved on to sequels and the franchise became what it is.   Lord knows I lived thru all the marketing over the years and it has been really cool even though I never saw any of the sequels.

Now the question is..  when to watch the next one?   I won't wait 43 years cause I don't have that kind of time, but I think I might get it in this year.   Why not?

**Spoilers for Rebels, Rogue One and Jedi Fallen Order**

After only recently watching through Rebels and finishing Fallen Order, I really love the peak Empire period of Star Wars, and the story that gets told across by the various movies, shows, comics etc in this period.

You have Fallen Order, set 5 years after the purge and the rise of the Empire, and it feels like the Empire is unstoppable. They have all the resources of the republic, put to use for a singular evil purpose. They can rip up any planet they want, take anything. It shows the early stages of the Death Star and mining of Jedi sacred sites for crystals. The story isn’t about dealing a blow to the empire—that’s impossible in this period—it’s about protecting some kids. A flashback has you play through Order 66 and it’s intense and terrifying. Then at the end Vader comes out of nowhere. You don’t know who he is, but you know he’s *far* too powerful for you. So you run.

Rebels begins 9 years(?) after that. It shows rebel cells coming together to form the Rebel Alliance, and how they acquire various resources and allies. You see senators turn against their government, which carries extra weight knowing the emperor later deals with this issue by abolishing the senate. Again Vader pops up and no one knows who this monster is, but they know he’s too strong. Later Ahsoka figures it out but she can barely believe it.

Rogue One shows the culmination of that. The Empire is about to unleash its strongest weapon, but the alliance has also grown strong. And then again with Vader at the end. 

You could also include A New Hope in this saga to round out the story. There’s also Solo, which I’d rather not talk about. And it doesn’t really fit in with the theme of the unstoppable Empire and the forces rising to meet it anyway (except a tiny bit at the start and at the end).

This all has me SUPER excited for the upcoming Kenobi show on D+. My favourite Star Wars character in my favourite period of the franchise.

11,Is Duchess Satine incompetent? (Spoilers The Clone Wars up to Season 5 Mandalore Arc),1597788119,"Hey guys, I’ve been watching Clone Wars for the first time ever, and I’ve gotten up to Season 5, just finished with the Maul/Mandalorians stuff and I have to ask, is Duchess Satine of Mandalore supposed to be portrayed as incompetent? 

I ask this because I’m pretty much every plot line Satine is in, it feels like the show is hinting that she is not very good at her job. In the first appearance from Satine on the show, she is betrayed by Pre Viszla, who is working with the separatists. Later on, she is betrayed by her advisor (I don’t remember his name), who is also working with the separatists.

Now I won’t hold what happens on Coruscant against her, because Coruscant from what we can see is corrupt as all get out and we can’t expect Satine to hold much power with the Senate when she belongs to a neutral system.

But then we go back to Mandalore where once again, Satine is betrayed by her prime minister Almec who is allowing the black market to run free and even ends up harming some children. 

So far, I get the sense that either Satine is a terrible judge of character or that the person who ruled Mandalore before her picked these people for the cabinet, and left Satine with a cabinet full of traitors. But either way, it seems that Satine has been unable to build a network of allies she can trust to help her rule on Mandalore, which seems to be a failing when you are trying to lead a planet.

Then, we get to the arrival of Death Watch and Maul’s Black Sun on Mandalore. Maul and Savage are pretty powerful so it makes sense that the Mandalorian army would not be able to deal with them, but what really got me even wanting to make this post is when Pre Viszla flies in and announces to the crowd that Death Watch will take care of the criminals. The crowd, less than five minutes after seeing this traitor fly in, start chanting “Viszla, Viszla” in a show of approval. And once Viszla has apprehended Savage, the people cry for him to be their new ruler. Was Satine that unpopular for the years since we met her last? It seems as if she failed to curry any public favor at all, so I have to wonder what, if any, attempts she made to address the public. We never got a good sense of what the public thought of Satine in the episodes on Mandalore but the fact that Death Watch were basically welcomed back as heroes seems to imply that Satine’s pacifist viewpoint was not very popular. So we have a Duchess who failed to win over her people, and failed to find anyone to trust. It is no wonder, then, that her rule collapsed. She even helps her successor, Maul, by saying “hey that’s almec, my prime minister, he’s corrupt and super greedy”, basically putting an advertisement on the guy.

In the end, it seems Satine’s only allies on Mandalore were her family: her nephew Korkie and her sister Bo Katan (although they were apparently enemies for a while, which makes me wonder if that is another sign of Satine’s incompetence, that she somehow turned her sister away). Obi Wan is a true ally to Satine, but ironically his arrival is what causes her death.

In terms of Satine’s rule, if it was one betrayal, I would chalk it up to people wanting to hurt her. But 3 of Satine’s most trusted advisor/governor/prime minister all betrayed her, which to me indicates that she was terrible at finding the right people for those positions and that she maybe even attracted that kind of personality to the throne. There must have been something fundamentally flawed in her as a person that she attracted and put into power such scumbags. And in the end even her people betrayed her.

Satine, from what we can see, is actually fine at action stuff, as she rescues Obi Wan from Death Watch and seems to know her way around a blaster. Very much like Padme in that sense, a person in a position of power who puts herself in danger but can get herself out of it. She might have been more happy as a security advisor or something like that instead of a Duchess.

As a Duchess, I feel that based off of her portrayal in Clone Wars, she is not very competent. I have a feeling that the Mandalorian history books will not be kind to her. Any thoughts? This is just based off of what I’ve watched of Clone Wars, I have not read any books or seen any other media that involved Satine, so I’m curious if they expand on what I am taking about here. I’d love to get some discussion going about what I perceive to be a tragic character who was in the wrong job for her personality, and that fact ultimately killing her.",StarWars,decross20,False,/r/StarWars/comments/icas9r/is_duchess_satine_incompetent_spoilers_the_clone/

77,"Rey hearing Ahsoka among the Jedi voices implies that Ahsoka died a Jedi, which is a really logical and lovely implication",1597768866,"*Before I start... I know Filoni wants to believe that Ahsoka is still somehow alive, but his opinions do not determine canon. As things stand, Ahsoka was dead during the events on Exegol. They can retcon it, sure, but as I will explain in this post, I believe it should stay that way, because it's insanely meaningful.*

I am one of the original Ahsoka fans. I've loved her ever since she first came on screen in TCW movie. Ahsoka's journey in TCW, which originally culminated in the finale of Season 5 with her leaving the Order was always so meaningful and fascinating to me. In fact, Season 5 has such a good ending that TCW honestly didn't need anything else beyond that, even though there were many plot threads still unresolved. Let me explain why. The final arc of Season 5 is everything TCW was about, distilled into one neat package. The prequels were in great part a showcase of how Palpatine used a false war to pervert and destroy the Republic, and how the Jedi essentially abandoned their own values and were consumed by hypocrisy and hubris. That is ultimately why Anakin fell to the dark side. In Revenge of the Sith, Palpatine tells Anakin that the Sith and Jedi are nothing but two rival sects of space wizards who want to rule the galaxy... and then the Jedi Council wipes the floor with their own code and proves Palpatine's point. Anakin grows convinced that it doesn't matter which side he picks, so why shouldn't he come down on the side of the guy who says he can save his wife from death? Reflect on the speech that Bariss gave at Ahsoka's trial when she confessed to being the real culprit...

*""I did it... because I have come to realize what many people in the Republic have come to realize. That the Jedi are the ones who are responsible for this war. That we have so lost our way that we have become villains in this conflict. That we are the ones who should be put on trial, all of us! And my attack on the Temple was an attack on what the Jedi have become. An army fighting for the dark side. Fallen from the light that we once held so dear. This Republic is failing! It's only a matter of time...""*

This is one of my favorite speeches in Star Wars, and it honestly beats even Maul's speech to Ahsoka in real finale. It's haunting and sad, especially when she says ""an army fighting for the dark side"" and the camera cuts to Palpatine, who is visibly seething with anger. She is right, they are nothing but his paws. It hits hard that the Jedi hypocrisy and hubris drove away Ahsoka from the Order and ruined her relationship with Anakin.

But let's go back to Anakin's choice in Revenge of the Sith. That scene perfectly mirrors and inverts his choice in Return of the Jedi. Why? Well, because Luke embraces the light side, the Jedi way, and shows Vader that Palpatine was wrong. The Jedi and the Sith are nothing alike. Luke rejects revenge and in doing so, he saves his father and the galaxy. It's the opposite of what Mace Windu did in Chancellor's Office all those years ago, and it's the reason why **""You've failed your highness, I am a Jedi like my father before me""** is one of the most epic and powerful statements in Star Wars. Luke transcends the failures of the old Jedi and brings his father back home.

Ahsoka failed to turn and reach Anakin because she abandoned the Jedi way. She embraced revenge and anger, and denied her true calling. However, near the end of her duel with Vader, she realized the error of her ways and saw that Anakin is not gone. He is still alive. She refuses to leave him, she won't leave him this time, despite the fact that he is trying to kill her, she still loves him. And she creates a hole in the ground so that Vader would fall through it and not be killed by the Sith weapon's blast. Because of this encounter, despite Vader remaining evil, Ahsoka was likely set back on the right path. The path of the Jedi. Justice is balance, and balance means rejecting the dark side. You cannot be ""grey"", at least not for long. The idea that you should embrace both light and darkness, that is actually the philosophy of the Sith! As stated clearly by Palpatine himself when he was trying to seduce Anakin in Revenge of the Sith...

*""If one is to understand the Great Mystery, one must study all its aspects, not just the dogmatic narrow view of the Jedi. If you wish to become a complete and wise leader, you must embrace a larger view of the Force...""*

The Jedi serve the light, but the Sith in general don't believe they serve the dark side or anyone for that matter. The philosophy of the Sith is egoism and selfishness. The Force is their tool, their slave and servant. Or at least, that's how they see it. The Sith respect no authority, no laws or rules. Moral, legal, or traditional. The Sith only care about themselves. A Sith owes no loyalty to their master, and in fact, should always be trying to transcend and betray their master.
 
The entire core message of the Skywalker saga a decisive rejection of the grey ""Jedi"" nonsense. Luke won and prevailed over his darkness, and he set right what went wrong when he saved Anakin. The dark side is evil and evil must be opposed. And as a consequence of Luke's actions in saving Anakin, and her own growth and evolution, Ahsoka eventually found her way back to the light. As TROS clearly shows, in the end, she died a Jedi and she was finally reunited with her old master, Anakin Skywalker, in the Force, forever. That's in my opinion a far more beautiful ending for her than any kind of contrived nonsense that they could come up to needlessly keep her alive.",StarWars,persistentInquiry,False,/r/StarWars/comments/ic4jc8/rey_hearing_ahsoka_among_the_jedi_voices_implies/

92,In my opinion it is extremely toxic to hold the once highly criticized prequels to such a high regard because you don't like the sequels.,1597765629,"Let me start this with a preface:

This is just my opinion, but feel free to discuss why you may agree or disagree.

I have been a Star Wars fan for as long as I can remember, and I love all things Star Wars. I will also say that I myself grew up with the prequels, and I have lots of love and nostalgia for them due to that. However, now that I'm an adult I have recognized that some of them (particularly episodes 1 and 2) are very flawed films. But there are things that are really great about them, much like all movies. This is the same with the sequels, movies I've been very critical of myself. I'll briefly showcase my feelings on all Disney era films in the saga:

1. The Force Awakens: I love this movie personally. A very well made film on a technical level as well as a great setup to a new trilogy as long as they go into new directions (more on that). I also felt the new characters introduced were great.
2. Rogue One: Fun side story, a little slow in the first half but very enjoyable the second half. The music is also great.
3. The Last Jedi: One of my least favorite of the saga. In my opinion Ryan Johnson's writing for this film made no sense just on a movie level. So many goofy moments too. The new characters he introduced were horribly written. I like the idea he was going for with Luke but felt he didn't develope it enough. But overall there's nothing the movie does to move the saga forward.
4. Solo: Not a film we needed but wasn't a disaster. Very fun and very underrated.
5. Rise Of Skywalker: Honestly I enjoyed this the first time seeing it but looking back it's a very forgettable movie. Not a satisfying end to the whole saga, the whole Rey being a Palpatine is just...weird to me. Kinda wish we got Duel Of The Fates instead. Finn was such a waste in the trilogy.

Now if you truly don't like the sequels that's fine to me, as I said above I absolutely have my problems with them too. But if you're criticism only boils down to ""Rey bad, Anakin good"", than I can't really take you seriously. It just seems the nostalgia for the prequels has created this idea that Star Wars was perfect before Disney came along. Which is very ironic as people used to blame George Lucas for killing it. I've even seen some suggest the prequels are better than the original films (which again if that's how you truly feel that's fine, I just haven't seen anyone really justify that).

As fans of Star Wars I feel we should appreciate the good of ALL of Star Wars, instead of blindly hating on the new to praise the old.

41,Concept for the Next Trilogy,1597747985,"I think Disney needs to sit tight for 10 years before another trilogy, let a generation pass on this one. Then release a trilogy set 150+ years after the battle of yavin. There is a new fledgling republic built around new planets that are wilder than the old core worlds, a new Grey force academy with statues to both Rey and Ben in front, based on the whill teachings. The students speak of master luke and Yoda and obiwan with the reverence for legends we see in the Old Republic series. But the crime syndicates have grown powerful again in the power vacuum, and the galaxy is divided. The grey adepts move around trying to police and aid like wild west marshals, searching for those with raw talent who need guidance, with lots of neutral force users everywhere, and fighting against those who use the force for evil. The first movie is just that: the main character, a disciple of Rey who is now training a Padawan is chasing after a force witch working for a gang cartel on nar shadaa, fighting their way through a seedy undercity full of bounty hunters and criminals and sewer beasts. Then the second movie you slam in some shift in pace, the witch in the first movie succeeded in awakening an ancient sith Lord entombed with his fleet millennia ago, who rises up and releases his undead troops to conquer a new sith empire. The third movie you bring in some ancient race that holds the key to stopping the sith lords macguffin, and he sends evil minions to stop them. At the end, the sith and grey adepts both have survived, but at a stalemate while regaining their strength. The sith stuck in ancient teachings from a forgotten age, puzzled by this strangely dynamic order who are balanced in the force. The grey adepts forced to begin confront the danger of the sith actively abducting force sensitives to brainwash for their army, and arguing about pressuring all the neutral force users that exist now into joining their academy to train to fight, and risk becoming like the Jedi order and unbalancing the force?",StarWars,drkpnthr,False,/r/StarWars/comments/ibys75/concept_for_the_next_trilogy/

45,Anakin Skywalker speech pattern evolution in 3 stages,1597745588,"I found a couple of threads about Anakin Skywalker's speech pattern change, I want to add my 2 cents with my own vision of speech patterns

I will need the help of a few concepts that I hope will be intuitive enough

I will analyze the pattern in 3 stages: (I will quote movies)

[Anakin Skywalker (kid), Anakin Skywalker (adult), Darth Vader/Anakin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZ734NWnAHA)

Every name is a link to help you navigate the post

I will also draw some music bands analogies at the end

 
[Anakin Skywalker (kid)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD7bpG-zDJQ) talks about *strongly/logically connected ""circumstances [most important at the moment]""*
 
""circumstances"" are special kind of facts, facts telling you about conditions or setup of a situation
 
and ""facts"" are just facts or events
 
""strong connection"" means a logical connection or a somewhat strong repeat/re-frame of already said information or a specific continuation of a thought
 
""most important"" means that you can easily chop the speech into pieces without losing context or meaning, every bit is a self-sustained point
 
""most important"" also means that the character cuts out unimportant info as opposed to speaking about everything
 
- *I saw your laser sword.* (=) *Only Jedi carry that kind of weapon.* **(+++)** *I don't think so...* (=) *No one can kill a Jedi Knight.*
 
- *I think you have...* (=) *why else would you be here?*
 
- *I can help!* (=) *I can fix anything!*
 
- *But Mom, I love it... and they need help... they're in trouble.* (=) *The prize money would more than pay for the parts they need.*
 
- *We have to help them, Mom...* (=) *you said that the biggest problem in the universe is no one helps each other...*
 
- *There are so many!* (=) *Do they all have a system of planets?*

[In dialogue Skywalker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD7bpG-zDJQ) communicates emotions by simultaneously laying out exposition or by getting hang on something

Skywalker is a young kid in the big unexplored world with big potential and curiosity and caring

 
 
[Anakin Skywalker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYbW1F_c9eM) [(adult)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UnjrG_N8hU) says speech bites connected by explanation/extension
 
it means that the next speech bit explains/extends/alters the previous bit
 
it is intuitively different from ""logical connection"", this connection is weaker
 
he still talks about ""the most important"" stuff (in a slight contradiction with ""extension"" feature)
 
- *I have no desire to be cured of this love either.* (=) *Long or short, I vow to spend the rest of my life with you.*
 
- *It's my job to protect you.* (=) *I said it's too dangerous.* (=) *You're not going, and that's final!*
 
- *So have you.* (=) *Grown more beautiful, I mean.* (=) *Well, for- for a senator, I mean.*
 
- *Why else do you think we were assigned to her if not to find the killer?* (=) *Protection is a job for local security, not Jedi.* (=) *It’s overkill, Master;* (=) *investigation is applies in our mandate.*
 
- *It was her idea.* (=) *Don’t worry: no harm will come to her.* (=) *I can sense everything going on in that room.* (=) *Trust me.*
 
- *I’d much rather dream about Padmé.* (=) *Just being around her is… intoxicating.*
 
- *And besides, you’re generalizing.* (=) *The Chancellor doesn’t appear to be corrupt.*
 
this pattern stays with him until the very ""end"":
 
- *From the Jedi point of view!* (=) *From my point of view, the Jedi are evil.*
 
- *This is the end for you, My Master.* (=) *I wish it were otherwise.*

[In dialogue Anakin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYbW1F_c9eM) often explains himself while himself having some unrealised feelings

Emotions affect Anakin by changing his look at life or by [forcing him to act](https://youtu.be/gYbW1F_c9eM?t=39)

 
 
[Darth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UnjrG_N8hU) [Vader](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZ734NWnAHA) says speech bites connected by both strong/logical connection and explanation/extension connection
 
and he makes larger accent on *""&lt;static circumstances&gt;""*
 
an example of ""&lt;static circumstances&gt;"" is ""I'm eating"", an example of ""dynamic circumstances"" is ""I'm going to get me some food""
 
""dynamic circs"" is something that comes (or came) to a particular event, ""&lt;static circs&gt;"" is something that does not really lead to anything or is a ""looped"" process or is a state of things or mind
 
Anakin Skywalker immediately switches to that pattern after fully becoming Darth Vader:
 
- *&lt;Where is Padme? Is she safe, is she all right?&gt;*
 
- *I couldn't have! &lt;She was alive! I felt her! She was alive! It's impossible! No!!!&gt;*
 
the ""most important"" semantic aspect fades out, ie Anakin now talks about everything without cutting information
 
- *Commander, tear this ship apart until you've found those plans and bring me the Ambassador. &lt;I want her alive!&gt;*
 
- *I have traced the Rebel spies to her. &lt;Now she is my only link to find their secret base!&gt;*
 
- *She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them. &lt;See to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time.&gt;*
 
- *&lt;They must be trying to&gt; return the stolen plans to the princess. &lt;She may yet be of some use to us.&gt;*
 
- *&lt;Escape is not his plan.&gt; I must face him alone.*
 
- *&lt;There is no escape.&gt; Don't make me destroy you. &lt;You do not yet realize your importance.&gt; You have only begun to discover &lt;your power&gt;. Join me and I will complete your training. &lt;With our combined strength,&gt; we can end &lt;this destructive conflict&gt; and bring &lt;order to the galaxy&gt;.* [(The Empire Strikes Back)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNwNXF9Y6kY)
 
Anakin keeps that pattern until the very [end](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L8p7_SLzvU):
 
- *&lt;Nothing can stop that now.&gt; Just for once... &lt;let me look on you with my own eyes.&gt;*
 
- *You already have, Luke. &lt;You were right about me.&gt; Tell your sister... &lt;you were right.&gt;*

Vader can leave both the other characters and the viewer to backtrack and follow his logic/motivation, he can wall himself off until a conclusion is reached (but after that a revelation may come)

[In dialogue Vader/Anakin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L8p7_SLzvU) eliminates options and judgements until only the critical option or judgement is left

""*I'm here to put you back &lt;on schedule.&gt; (...) Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them. (...) &lt;I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am.&gt;*"" (Vader to Jerjerrod, VI)


I believe those patterns are thinking patterns, they tell (in an abstract way) on what a personality focuses on
 
You can view those patterns as different ""exposition roles"", each personality tells you something about some layer of the situation

*A big new world —&gt; A big confusion —&gt; No options left*

You also can try to ""arrange"" those patterns by how much a pattern focuses on a singular/important fact:

*Darth Vader &lt; adult Anakin &lt; kid Skywalker*

You can also view this as the farther you go the more context-independent or conditions-independent or context self-contained or absent of links to outside factors or """"open"""" it gets

From the childhood Anakin Skywalker gets dragged into more and more circumstances until is totally buried in his armor

though formally starts as a slave and becomes more and more ""free"", actually the reality around becomes more and more wrecked &amp; convoluted with these strange Jedi rules and uncaring and loving ones at danger and etc.

***

A music bands analogy of this speech pattern change:

[I Like Trains &lt;— Peter Gabriel  &lt;— John Lennon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)


[Anakin Skywalker (kid)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD7bpG-zDJQ) = [John Lennon eg Instant Karma! (We All Shine On)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLy2SaSQAtA) or [Imagine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkgkThdzX-8)

- *Why in the world are we here?* (=) *Surely not to live in pain and fear?* (=) *Why on earth are you there when you're everywhere?* (=) *Come and get your share!*

- *Imagine there's no heaven* (=) *It's easy if you try* (=) *No hell below us* (=) *Above us only sky*

""strongly/logically connected circumstances [most important at the moment]""

""strong connection"" being a logical connection or a somewhat strong repeat/re-frame of already said information or a specific continuation of a thought

""most important"" also being cutting out unimportant info as opposed to speaking about everything

expressing emotions by simultaneously laying out exposition or by getting hang on something



[Anakin Skywalker (adult)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYbW1F_c9eM) = [Peter Gabriel eg Don't Give Up (ft. Kate Bush)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjEq-r2agqc) or [Shock The Monkey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnVf1ZoCJSo)

- *I was taught to fight, taught to win* (=) *I never thought I could fail* **(+++)** *I've changed my face, I've changed my name* (=) *But no one wants you when you lose*

- *Something knocked me out the trees,* (=) *now I'm on my knees* (=) *Cover me, darling please* **(+++)** *There is one thing you must be sure of* (=) *I can't take anymore* **(+++)** *You throw your pearls before the swine* (=) *make the monkey blind*

speech bites connected by explanation/extension, the next speech bit explains/extends/alters the previous bit

talking about ""the most important"" stuff (you can easily chop the speech into pieces)

explaining yourself while having some unrealised feelings (jealousy and coping with a big upset)



[Vader/Anakin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L8p7_SLzvU) = [I Like Trains eg A Rook House for Bobby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7LQ9We7Tyc) or [Death of an Idealist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyuT5rZVe10) or [Terra nova](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7avn-UDdtY)

- *&lt;All I ever wanted to do is play chess with you&gt; But if they find me They will indite me &lt;I just can't fight anymore&gt;*

- *This is a breakdown &lt;You are a cancer&gt; This will be the death of me I'll never live this down You will never*

- *&lt;And mores the shame You will remember my name&gt;* **(+++)** *&lt;And I do not think that we can hope For any better things now&gt; &lt;Oh the end Cannot be far It cannot be far I cannot wait&gt;*

speech bites connected by both strong/logical connection and explanation/extension connection

large accent on *""&lt;static circumstances&gt;""* (""looped"" process or a state of things or mind)

eliminating options and judgements until only the critical option or judgement is left

(p.s: the very last song quote reminds me of Darth Vader first desperate lines)

[I Like Trains &lt; Peter Gabriel  &lt; John Lennon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNvUS-6PTbs)

the farther you go the more context-independent or conditions-independent or context self-contained or absent of links to outside factors or """"open"""" it gets

**P.S.** What do you think? I probably can afford an analysis of ""all"" characters, not just Anakin Skywalker...


I think those patterns are applicable to real people and music bands, so for me studying those patterns is like the Force

not that can give the loved ones immortality, but that can at least save the memory of them and make that memory valuable

***

Offtopic: perception of a voice for me depends on semantics/rhythm that voice conveys, so I can really hear Darth Vader in the I Like Trains (or Hayden Christensen in Peter Gabriel) if I want, sorry for that useless meaningless remark

46,Darth Sidious doesn't get enough love,1597745521,"I was watching the Revenge of the Sith again (my favorite star wars movie), and i realized that the Emperor doesn't get enough love for the machinations and planning that went into the downfall of the Jedi. 

Playing a career diplomat, selecting and creating a clone army without anyone knowing, corrupting the republic from within, inciting rebellions from the trade federation and separatists, using these wars to take more and more power in the senate while looking like a benevolent overlord, manipulating the Jedi into taking the leadership roles for the very army he made to kill them, playing chess on a galactic scale to stretch all forces thin, and finally exterminating the jedi and the rebels in one fell swoop. The amount of planning that goes into all this is awe inspiring. 

While I love the Clone Wars I don''t like the retcon of the implanted chips in the clone brains.. I much rather liked the idea that they were just soldiers who followed orders and therefore had no feelings of animosity against the Jedi which they could've picked up (from the republic commando series and the RotS novelization).

48,Did Anakin fulfill the prophesy and bring balance to the force?,1597745384,"So I am a big fan of Star Wars, but I've only watched the movies. I don't read the comics or anything so my knowledge isn't so great beyond what they tell us in the movies.

So, the prophesy basically says how the chosen one will being balance to the force, and it is assumed that this is Anakin.

However he turns to the dark side. And yoda also mentions how the prophesy may have been misread/misinterpreted.

My perception has been that despite turning to the dark side, he did fulfill the prophesy by ""killing"" Palpatine when he was attacking Luke. However, since the new movies have came out, we know he didn't succeed in killing him. 

So, did he fail? Was the prophesy wrong? Was someone else the chosen one, e.g. Rey or Kylo.

OR did he still succeed? It never said he had to kill anyone. Just bring balance. By getting rid of the Emperor, Luke went on to train Leia partially, and then young future Jedi. So in a way...balance was restored.

Also in the 2004 edit, Han says ""yes, I'll bet you have"", responding to Greedo and then draws his dl44, but Greedo drew his quicker, gets a shot off, misses, and then gets fried by Han.

2,I watched A New Hope yesterday - Review,1597720839,"And I was actually disappointed. 

This weekend, Star Wars: A New Hope was playing in Event Cinemas in Australia. I decided to go and watch it with my partner. 

I didn't go into the cinema with high expectations. Considering the age of the movie and it being the first in the series.

I can easily recognize its cinematic achievements, and the practical effects were astounding. The CGI in the director's cut however was questionable. 

What I didn't like was the consistent use of wipe cuts. It makes the movie look tacky and unprofessional. I know that it was an independent film on tight budget but it takes more effort to do a wipe cut than a jump cut.

The story as well was very unfulfilling. Nothing felt earned, especially Luke an Han's relationship. After he returned, they acted like they had known each other years when it had been maybe 5 days tops.

Obi Wan's death also felt really unfulfilling. Why did he do that? Luke's reaction also was unearned and all things considered, very selfish. 

From a cinematic standpoint, I enjoyed it (besides the wipe cuts), but the story was unfulfilling and the emotions were unearned.

You rarely see a story where the hero loses, but wins by sparking something in a sub villain. I liked it, aside the prequels prophecy it felt realistic.

19,Kathleen Kennedy has become the new George Lucas as the scapegoat of the franchise,1597685294,"You don't have to look far to see a headline something along the lines of ""KATHLEEN KENNEDY OUT TO DESTROY STAR WARS!!!!"". Other articles gleefully rumouring that Kathleen Kennedy is going to be kicked out of Lucasfilms or is booted from the set of The Mandalorian. Or articles frothing with anger that Kathleen Kennedy is ruining The Mandalorian and is probably in the process this very moment of taking a big steaming dump on Baby Yoda. 

People have practically been making a career out of turning one woman into the boogeyman of the Star Wars franchise and trying to pin the blame of fans hurt expectations one one person. Anyone who has been involved with movies in any capacity knows there are a lot more hands stirring the pot than fan discourse would have you believe. 

This cannot be stated hard enough: One person does not ruin a multibillion dollar franchise. It just doesn't happen. 

Kathleen Kennedys resume goes back decades and guaranteed most of you reading have not only watched but loved a huge portion of her library. Her success can't be understated so it's incredibly strange to see news articles trying to throw this one person under the bus for something that was the work of many creative minds, all with their part to play in why Star Wars turned out the way it did.

Star Wars fans need a scapegoat. It happened with George Lucas and it's happening with Kathleen Kennedy. After the prequels fans absolutely tore Lucas a new one, essentially claiming he was a creative hack and trying to attribute all of his past success to everyone else and their dog. To a large extent Rian Johnson and J. J. Abrams got the same treatment but now that Lucas has washed his hands of the franchise and the two directors are not involved anymore the big daddy scapegoat remains Kathleen Kennedy.

The impossible task of trying to feed fan nostalgia, remain true to the spirit of Star Wars while building a new lore that can appeal to younger fans, that says goodbye to a beloved original cast and then adding the passing of Carrie Fisher on top of it. Lets be honest, the Skywalker Saga never had much of a chance of hitting all those targets. It's not the fault of the boogeymans George Lucas or Kathleen Kennedy, Star Wars is a notoriously difficult piece of media to adapt to the big screen in the first place but the legacy of the Skywalker Saga makes it damn near impossible. 

As a fan you have to know when to step back. Star Wars has it's highs and it's lows and but through it all it's the fans who have been fueling this hate train that's been leading nowhere. Fan hate hasn't led to any positive changes, it's only led to people playing it so safe that main series almost feels almost like a parody of itself while the side series with less to lose and less fan vitriol directed towards it are able to expand creatively. The franchise keep steaming full ahead and will continue to make gems and missteps. 

The fans have a choice in how they handle the missteps.

-	Miniature games have strict rules on not touching another players items
-	Our RPG sessions will be more spaced out

-	Discussions need to happen a half-hour at a time, can spill over into future weeks
-	Assume grades anywhere from 7-12
-	Many have seen Clone Wars, but not all
-	I’m happy with prompts that deal with in-universe, our-of-universe, or art as a whole centered on Star Wars

58,Appreciating The Rise of Skywalker: the Pasaana sequence,1597676399,"I've done my fair share of criticising Episode IX since it came out, but I'm finally giving it a rewatch now that I've processed most of my disappointment about it. The entire Pasaana part of the movie strikes me as probably the best part of this entire movie, mostly for how consistent and fun it is.

- I love the Festival of the Ancestors. It looks absolutely amazing and feels like a real event for real people. Pasaana may be a desert planet but it actually feels like people live there.

- I like the chase scene. There aren't enough land chase scenes in Star Wars and this one is a fine addition, with some fancy maneuvering and stormtroopers getting absolutely bodied by the goodies.

- I like Lando's return. He shows up, kills a guy, shares precious information, and send the group on their way without overstaying his welcome.

- I like how Force skyping is used here (and throughout the movie, to be honest). Kylo exploiting the bond between Rey and himself is a great trick.

- I like the Indiana Jones-esque feel of the whole sequence. Particularly the coincidence which leads the group to fall right where they need to, and I like them exploring what is technically a hidden tomb.

- The tension in the ship/lightsaber duel is fantastic. It's almost a shame that they used it as a teaser because seeing that for the first time in the theater would have been amazing.

- The transport ship tug-of-war is incredibly cool and I still have not recovered, months later, from the lightning bursting from Rey's hand. As much as I dislike ""Rey Palpatine"", this bit is one of my favourite things in Star Wars, ever.

- I like most of the jokes, although C-3PO gets a few too many. Only half of his land properly for me. The old married couple banter of Finn and Poe is excellent, though.

The Pasaana sequence is a fun ride but still somehow a relaxing break from the rapid-fire exposition of the beginning of the movie.

67,Lightsaber colors don't mean anything.,1597674609,"Now, please wait, put down your keyboards, I know. I'll elaborate. 

Yes, KOTOR had ""blessed"" us with the knowledge that lightsaber colors mean something. Virtually ALL references to the lightsaber colors trace back to KOTOR Jedi classes. Even sourcebooks like Jedi Path ultimately reference only up to that point. 

That however about one and only source that says that lightsaber colors mean something. 

Even the game itself doesn't reference or reinforce it in any way. Even as you build your character, you can just do whatever. It just throws this bit into the aether and it starts snowballing with nonsense, with people trying to justify that somehow any character in the movies fits into these RPG classes for a game.

They do not fit these classes. These classes are game mechanics. They're not supposed to be enforced in-universe. 

And in other media, this whole issue is nonexistent altogether. In no novel or comic I've read (and I've read plenty) that describes a character assembling a lightsaber, any importance is put on color. Color is often literally the last thing character thinks about. The process of creating a lightsaber by itself is an arcane and meaningful one, not what color you get. 

Ultimately, only real meaning that lightsaber can have is one that is imbued into it by its creator. This can be literally anything - from Tenel Ka using rancor tusks for her handle and rainbow gems to signify her accepting both sides of her heritage to Corran Horn using durindfire to make his blade silver to connect to his corellian jedi ancestors, or Jaina Solo making her own synthetic crystals to make her lightsaber purely expression of herself. 

In these examples only Corran deliberately chose his lightsaber color, and it has nothing to do with any of ""Jedi classes"" from four thousand years ago. 

Similarly, at no point in any novel or comic, when a lightsaber fight is portrayed nobody ever judges their opponent by the color of their lightsaber blade. Thanks to narration every reader is privy to inner thoughts of many characters, and to my knowledge none of them ever thought *""Huh, so his blade is blue, so he's a melee fighter. I'll have to target his Will Save.""*

And new canon is not much different in this regard. 

Only real wrench there is that now Red crystals actually DO have a meaning, signifying corruption with the Dark Side. 

Other than that, I believe it's still unexplained how exactly crystals attain their color during the attunement. Apparently it depends on a jedi handling them, but what exactly differs is not explained to my knowledge. 

Ahsoka used a green blade, but later assembled a shoto which was a different yellowish hue. What does it mean? No idea, other than that she probably matured a bit since her first gathering. Later she purified a set of corrupted red crystals, and they produced white blades. Does this mean that any purified crystal becomes white? Or that maybe Ahsoka's changed mindset makes them white after attunement? There's no way to know for sure. 

Ahsoka believes that they're white because she abandoned the Jedi Order, but that's the meaning she imbues into them.",StarWars,Kyle_Dornez,False,/r/StarWars/comments/ibf69k/lightsaber_colors_dont_mean_anything/

One of the cool things about Star Wars, to me anyway, was the realism, loose as it can be, to certain real life aspects. In particular the military side of things (I'm military so am biased to these things).

When you see Yavin 4 in R1 and ANH and Hoth in ESB, there is a reality to how the military bases look and operate. It's a rebellion but also a military venture, hence putting the Wars in SW. Things and extras seem to have a purpose that builds a realism into each scene.

Now in the ST, every time there is a scene in a resistance base, on a planet or in a ship hanger, all of the extras are running around, seemingly pointlessly in the background. I'm tempted to rewatch them to see if there are any extras you can pick that are running obvious loops. I get that from a film making perspective, it was probably a choice to show a sense of urgency in the bases, but from a real military perspective, it's just completely unbelievable and pulls me out of the story.

For thoose who don't know, in the Star Wars universe a year is 368 days long and each day is 24 hours.
As a point of reference for the events in the films is mostly used the BBY(=Before Battle of Yavin) and ABY(=After Battle of Yavin) system.
The Battle of Yavin is the Battle of the First Death Star, the one we see at the end of A New Hope, so we can assume that 0 BBY is only the Battle of Yavin and everything before and after is respectively BBY and ABY.
But, Rogue One and a few of the last episodes of Rebels Season 4 are labelled on WookieePedia as 0 BBY, so this means that 0 BBY is a full 368 days year and not just a moment during the Battle of Yavin?
For example:
Anakin is born in 41 BBY, this means that he is 41 during Rogue One and A New Hope.
So when he dies in Return of the Jedi, that is set in 4 ABY, he is 46 years old (41+1+4) or 45 (41+4)?
Or was he 45 just because he hadn't turned 46 yet but would have turned 46 in 4 ABY?

For a simplier example, a character born on the first day of 1 BBY, on the first day of 1 ABY would turn 1 year old or 2 years old?



All this has always made me question the age of the characters that appeared in the Original Trilogy and it's a while that I'm looking for a completed answer.

Thanks in advance to all who will reply!

26,Luke's arc in The Last Jedi: The Hero's Journey,1597654051,"Here is my view of TLJ Luke as per the usual outline of ""The Hero's Journey"":

**Departure / Separation**: Luke has disappeared and cut himself off from the Force.

**Call to Adventure**: Rey appears to Luke and presents the lightsaber to Luke.

**Refusal of the Call**: Luke tosses the lightsaber away and walks away from Rey, rejecting her multiple pleas.

**Supernatural Aid**: The Force and Yoda return to Luke, helping him contextualize historically what it means to be a Jedi and to understand his place as a master whose natural eventuality is to be succeeded and grown beyond.

**Crossing the Threshold**: Luke agrees to give Rey three lessons.

**Initiation / Trials:** Luke imparts difficult wisdom to Rey, who, in turn, challenges, disrespects, and defies Luke.

**The Temptress**: Rey unsuccessfully, at first, tempts Luke to rejoin the fight at a time he has fully given himself to a future of peace beyond the galaxy's struggle.

**Atonement**: Part one: Luke finally reveals to Rey what happened that night when he went to visit Ben Solo who was asleep at the time. Part two: Luke visits Leia and apologizes. She is forgiving and understanding. Part three: Luke atones to the Republic/Resistance for his absence by projecting himself on Crait to help them escape while also (Part four) confronting his former student and owning up to his failure as Ben Solo's teacher.

**Apotheosis / Refusal of the Return / Master of Two Worlds**: Luke, at the height of his Jedi powers, achieves what few Jedi could ever do in this Force Projection and is able to willingly merge the Force while at peace with his purpose. Also, Luke ""returns"" as a Jedi, but chooses not return physically to the mortal world, where it would be expected of him to use the Force against the First Order (much like the Jedi Order of old was expected to defend the Republic). Luke knew the past and was wise enough not to be lured back into a virtually endless war proliferated under the name of Skywalker.

**Freedom to Live**: Through his various choices, in spite of mistakes made throughout his life, Luke Skywalker has proven time and again to be selfless, compassionate, and heroic, attaining a rare dual freedom for himself, the Rebellion/Resistance/Republic, and the galaxy at large. He ultimately has used his powers to empower the powerless while at the same time not succumbing to a Sith-like relentless pursuit and maintenance of power. In so doing, he becomes among the ultimate of Jedi and can serve as a lasting figure of study and wisdom. By the end of the film, Luke is already shown to inspire the next potential generation of Force-wielders, especially the boy with the broom.",StarWars,ShambolicClown,False,/r/StarWars/comments/ibagyh/lukes_arc_in_the_last_jedi_the_heros_journey/

He was the general

When he came across this young Jedi 
Welding a lightsaber and making it push
And Grevious jumped up on a rusty bot
And said, ""Jedi, let me tell you what""
""I guess you didn't know it
But I'm a lightsaber wielder too
And if you'd care to take a dare, I'll make a bet with you
Now you wield a pretty good Saber, boy

I'll bet the lightsaber of Darth Plagueis
Against your force and saber
'Cause I think four arms are better than you.""

And it might lead to the dark side
But I'll take your bet, you're gonna regret
'Cause I'm the best force user there's ever been.""

Well the duel was felt all across the galaxy 
But it was clear who won 
The Jedi who got the high ground 
Was the one who won that round 
Grevious knowing he had been beat 
Laid the lightsaber at his feet 
And said ""You must be on the council""
The Jedi said ""That's right and you got beat 
And comes a title with that defeat""
Gervious said ""And what's that?""

71,We NEED a Dave Filoni animated series taking place in the year gap between The Last Jedi and Rise of Skywalker,1597635574,"

-

As most of you know, Dave Filoni is the mastermind of two of the greatest Star Wars spin-offs, Clone Wars and Rebel. Plus, he's involved with the insanely popular Mandalorian, and the somewhat lackluster but still okay Resistance series.

-


The great thing about the Clone Wars and Rebels series, was that they expanded the lore of the series, while also giving character development that the movies didn't have time to do.


-


In fact, I've heard people say that Clone Wars redeem both the Prequels and Anakin's character. for many fans 


-


As for Rebels, it expanded on the lore Clone Wars introduced, giving more detail into the origins of the force, the Mandalorians, Maul, and of the introduction of important characters such as Ezra and Thrawn. 


-


If the Clone Wars could redeemed the prequels, perhaps an animated series in between Episode VIII and  IX could also redeem the sequels. 


-


To my understanding, there is a whole year gap between The Last Jedi and Rise of Skywalker.  If episode VII and VIII took place in the span of two weeks, imagine how much stuff happened in the year gap leading to episode IX. 

-


Here's just some of the things an Animated series could do:


-


**Expand the relationship between Rey, Finn, and Poe**


-


While Rey and Finn have a very well defined friendship, Rey and Poe was much weaker in comparison. I don't think they even met until the end of the second movie. But in Rise of Skywalker, we're suppose to believe they're all best friends. 


-


In the year gap, we could see all three of them go on missions together, and actually see Rey and Poe build a real friendship. 


-


**Leia training Rey**


-


At the end of the third film, it was revealed that Leia was a Jedi at one point. While it's annoying that the films didn't reveal this important detail until the very end, this new aspect of Leia's character could be greatly expanded on.

-


Imagine a whole year of Leia teaching Rey the force. Leia showing off her powers. Rey taking the time to learn and master her powers, getting rid of the stereotype of a Mary Sue. 


-


**Rey vs Kylo**


-


In the Clone Wars, Obi-Wan and Anakin fought Dooku and Grivevous at least a 100 times. I don't think it would be canon breaking for Rey and Kylo to run into each other a couple times in the year gap. A few fan service battle that don't go anywhere, just like in Clone Wars. 



-


**Giving Rose some character development.**


-


While Rose wasn't a popular character, it was still pretty douch-y of JJ Abrams to try and wipe her character out of existence in Rise of Skywalker. At least give Rose some closure to her crush with Finn. 


-



**Rey meeting Ezra**


-


One of the biggest missed opportunities in the Sequel trilogy, was that they could have tied the animated series into the films by bringing Ezra back. Out of all the original animated characters from Clone Wars / Rebels, the one Jedi most likely to still be alive in the Sequels is Ezra. He was the same age as Luke, and didn't appear as a Force Voice. 


-


Instead of Leia training Rey, Ezra could have shown up and trained Rey after Luke passed away. Ezra could have helped fight Palpatine, in the same way Ahsoka should have helped fight Palpatine in the Return of the Jedi. 

-


Well, we could fix that in animated series. Rey would still train under Leia for most of the animated series. But at some point in the middle, Rey could find Ezra and train under him. Until something happens that separates them, and prevents Ezra from helping in the Rise of Skywalker. 



-


**The Dead Speak. Palpatine's return**


-

Instead of leaving important plot points for Fortinite and Novels. An animated series could actually show Palatines return and speech. They could explain his resurrection and Snoke better for the audience.

76,The Misinformation Regarding George Lucas and the Production of Star Wars is Getting Out of Hand,1597632687,"***NOTE: I am not commenting on the quality of the films. Just the intention behind them and the facts of the production.***

&amp;#x200B;

This will likely be lost in the shuffle but I felt compelled to say something. I've seen it said on reddit that you don't realise how much misinformation gets thrown around online until you see discussion about a topic you actually know about. I guess this is mine. As a filmmaker and film lover I'm constantly disappointed at the way Star Wars and George Lucas is discussed.

&amp;#x200B;

There are a lot of recycled phrases I see on this subreddit and other forums like *""Lucas was a great ideas man, he just needed more people to reign him in""* or *""He was never a good writer or director, he said it himself!""* or worst of all *""Star Wars was saved in editing/Lucas' ex wife saved Star Wars""*. There seems to be this cultural movement to reduce Lucas' involvement and contributions to Star Wars as much as possible and it's very misinformed. The image of Lucas that seems to exist in the internet consciousness isn't at all accurate to the sort of filmmaker or man that he was.

&amp;#x200B;

First and foremost, **Star Wars was not saved in editing more than any other film**. There is no film before the edit. What most are unknowingly referring to is the John Jympson rough cut of the film. While Lucas was still filming parts of the film overseas, Jympson began cutting together an edit with the footage they had already shot. Upon seeing this rough cut Lucas disliked it a lot for a variety of reasons regarding the shot selection, edit points, and overall pace. They tried to find a get on the same page as time went on but eventually it became clear that Jympson didn't share Lucas' vision for the film and was fired. On the matter Lucas said *""Unfortunately it didn't work out. It's very hard when you are hiring people to know if they are going to mesh with you and if you are going to get what you want. In the end, I don't think he fully understood the movie and what I was trying to do. I shoot in a very peculiar way, in a documentary style, and it takes a lot of hard editing to make it work."".* 

&amp;#x200B;

After this Lucas brought in three editors Paul Hirsch, Richard Chew, and Marcia Lucas. The four of them worked together on the final cut of the film and while Lucas is uncredited he was a very hands on presence in the cutting of the film. In fact, the final Trench Run sequence was cut almost shot for shot based on a template reel Lucas spliced together of World War 2 documentary and film footage. The film was not saved in the edit, it just edited same as any other film. Lucas had final cut as well over the film as well so the idea that the finished product was one that he didn't intend is ridiculous. The theatrical cut was completely his preferred version of the film at the time. Even this myth had any credibility to it (it doesn't) it doesn't change the fact that the script, sets, costumes, score, special effects, sound effects, performances, and characters were all groundbreaking and iconic. Are people going to pretend he had nothing to do with any of that as well?

&amp;#x200B;

In terms to the quality of his screenwriting and or his apparently unwieldy ideas that simply must be reigned in, this is admittedly a subject of personal taste and mindset but I still feel like the record needs to be set straight in regards to some of it. Not that awards are an iron clad indicator of quality but it bears reminding that both *American Graffiti* and *A New Hope* were nominated for Best Original Screenplay Oscars and won countless other accolades. The only reason Alec Guinness agreed to what he saw as a nonsense space flick was because he wanted to work with Lucas who he thought was a genius, and he even admitted that while he thought the *Star Wars* screenplay would be nauseating he couldn't help but be compelled by it. Lucas was also the main driving force behind *Empire* and *Jedi* as well, so much so that many people involved with the production credit him with essentially ghost directing *Jedi*. After a widely considered poor first draft of *The Empire Strikes Back* from Leigh Brackett, Lucas rewrote the script from the ground up. Lawrence Kasdan was brought in late in the game for some dialogue punch ups but noted Star Wars historian **JW Rinzler said on a recent interview that he believes Kasdan receives too much credit for a script that was essentially Lucas' through and through.** Unrelated, but conversely he said the script for *Raiders of the Lost Ark* was very much Kasdan's more than anyone else. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another sentiment that plagues Star Wars discussion is that Lucas was somehow a lazy or careless director. This is particularly in reference to the prequels and perceived poor performances of the actors and stagnant or dull cinematography. First of all I think it's a silly notion that Lucas intentionally chose basic coverage because it was ""easier"" as if somehow if he wanted to move the camera more it would require more effort from him personally. He's said many times that is approach to cinematography in Star Wars has always been very objective and documentary like. He became fascinated with cinéma vérité and the idea of ""pure cinema"" in film school and it shows in all 6 of his features and many of his shorts. He chose shots that could believably achieved by a documentary crew if the locations and situations were real, not choreographed blocking and rehearsed camera moves. I understand this choice has been somewhat controversial but the fact is that it was a choice. A considered and deliberate decision to try and ground the films and subconsciously make them feel real and believable in the mind of the viewer. Similarly, the performances are very intentionally operatic and pulpy. Just because they are not naturalistic that doesn't make them inherently poor. It's widely known that Star Wars was influenced by pulp serials and Kurosawa films and the style of acting in the prequels is very much in line with this. Again, I know this type of performance was not necessarily what audiences wanted, but that doesn't indicate a lack of effort or ability on his behalf. In the behind the scenes footage for all three prequels he is constantly talking to the actors and collaborating with the crew. He's a very engaged and active presence on set. He's constantly navigating issues, problem solving, and discussing ideas with the people around him. **He wasn't some lazy tyrant surrounded by yes men, he was a director surrounded by like minded collaborators who shared and believed in his vision for the films.** 

&amp;#x200B;

Similarly, the amount of CGI that he used was not an attempt to be lazy or make the process easier. In case you didn't know more models/sets/practical effects were used on each prequel film than for the entire Original Trilogy. And in addition to this, the CGI was being developed explicitly for the films, it wasn't a crutch, it was something entirely new that had to be created from scratch. How else were landscapes like Mustafar, Coruscant, Kamino and many more possibly meant to be created without extensive use of CGI? There's no real world equivalent to any of these places and the time and cost of creating fully realised sets for them would be astronomical. The directorial choices he made might not have been ones you liked but they were ones that he made to best serve the story he was telling.

&amp;#x200B;

Lucas funded all of the films himself (except *A New Hope*) entirely out of pocket to avoid the studio system. **The prequel trilogy are the most expensive independent films ever made**, and make no mistake, they are independent films. He was interested more in artistic expression and creativity than the shackles of focus group and committee filmmaking. He was already a multi-millionaire by the time of *The Phantom Menace*, there is no corporate mandate or cynicism in those films at all. The only reason he made it was to tell a story. He gave all the money from the Disney purchase to charity as well. He is an artist first and foremost, he wasn't interested in the corporate or monetary side of things.

&amp;#x200B;

All of this information is available for free online. If you're interested enough about Star Wars to comment on the production of it then it's worth being informed. All 6 behind the scenes documentaries are available for free on YouTube and they're very non-glossy and candid looks at the production. They are on par with the Lord of the Rings BTS features and incredibly are interesting. Also *Empire of Dreams* is a fantastic look at the production of the Original Trilogy and it's on Disney+. Or even better watch *THX1138* or *American Graffiti* and you'll get a better understanding of Lucas as a filmmaker.

6,I'm really glad I gave Star Wars a second chance,1597617823,"It's after midnight and I can't sleep so I thought I'd just put my Star Wars journey out there:

So, the first time I saw Star Wars was maybe five years to seven years ago, when I was in my mid-teens. Basically, we didn't watch it at home because my dad doesn't like it, so I'd never gotten to see it. It came up in discussion with a friend who went: ""WHAT? YOU'VE NEVER SEEN STAR WARS??"" and then she made me watch all six movies that were out at the time. And I don't know if it's because my friend made me watch the movies in German dub (which in my experience takes away from the experience because so much gets lost in translation) or if it's because we watched them in chronological order or if it's because we'd meet up, she put on the movies on her laptop and leave me to watch the movies alone while she went to do her nails on the other side of the room - but I went away from the experience being entirely 'meh' about the whole thing. It's not that I disliked the movies, I just didn't really feel the need to watch them again, ever.

Fast forward a couple of years, and my younger sister is a really big nerd. Marvel, DC, Star Wars, all that good stuff - and she was watching Star Wars (OT) one evening on her own. I didn't really have anything to do at the time, so I decided to join her. And I absolutely fell in love. We originally only had the OT at home, which I liked so much that I also got us the Prequels, Sequels, Rogue One and Solo. Which I all thoroughly enjoy despite their flaws (or maybe because of their flaws?). Anyways, this was back in February, at which time I was kind of in a dark place. Discovering Star Wars helped me through that, simply by providing something to hold on to and characters to connect to. And now, here I am, happily collecting Star Wars books, funkos, video games and even LEGO (and I realise I've been spending way too much money, but it makes me happy, so it's totally worth it). I watch one of the movies every other week or so, and since there's always new stuff being released, there's always something to look forward to, which is something that I really need in my life and I'm happy I found it.

Stackpole on how Luke's Jedi Academy should run (Legends),1597609024,"I have just returned from a short break from reading l, Jedi and, a few pages back in, I reached the scene were Stackpole was clearly critiquing Anderson's creation of Luke's Jedi Academy through a debate between Luke (representing Anderson) and Corran, Stackpole's self insert character, and demanding that it be more militaristic in it's methods rather than being spiritually focused. Which feels like he is missing the point of what the Jedi are supposed to be in the first place.

Don't get me wrong, Jedi should have some level of combat training, but they should only use violence in self defence or the defence of others, never to attack.

The purpose of the Jedi is to act as conduits of the Force, finding inner balance and teaching others to achieve that too. The Jedi should be the impartial judges and negotiators of the galaxy, not some militaristic force.

Although, I can agree with Stackpole's critiques of Luke's Academy. Luke's very hands off approach to teaching. While I understand and like that the padawans (I know that term wasn't introduced until the PT, I just don't care) had a level of self learning, I think Luke was a bit too hands off with them.

Now almost every Star Wars fan wants to jump into a spaceship and fly around in the Star Wars galaxy, fighting enemies and exploring this amazing galaxy. Unfortunately we can’t at the moment and I would like to give some ideas on how to make this work.

Now I’m first going to start off with the problems that an open world Star Wars game has had, being the reason we don’t have one yet.

The Star Wars galaxy is MASSIVE. There are tens of thousands of planets, and along with the intricacy of some of the planets, just creating the game would take forever. Another major issue is the Star Wars lore, and possible creators of the game would have a logistical nightmare trying to weave everything in. The last major part would be the story. They would have to somehow cram a story into this game, making the creation process take even longer.

For most developers, the risk is not worth the reward, as they would probably have to spend upwards of 10 years developing this game and a lot of money, all for a game that has no guarantee that it will blow up.

I have a few solutions for these problems. They won’t be complete fixes but they make the massive nightmare of a project slightly easier to bear.

So let’s get rid of the massive galaxy problem first. So I think they should use the game No Man’s Sky as a template. For anybody who hasn’t heard of the game or doesn’t know much about it, no mans sky is a open world space game that has a massive galaxy with millions of planets to explore. They make this work by making the game procedurally generated. If you want more information go check it out online because it would take a long time to describe here. So my solution for the new Star Wars game would be to make any planets that haven’t appeared in canon be procedurally generated. This would save a lot of time and also make it feel more unique when you are actually exploring the galaxy. They could also use aspects of procedural generation to deal with massive planets like Coruscant, where they have the senate building and the Jedi temple as a point of interest, but still have a city planet. This won’t make building planets easy or fast, but will significantly reduce time to make the game. This would cause a problem with keeping everything canon, as it would be very easy for things to contradict when we are procedurally generating. 

So now let’s deal with Canon continuity. You see many people would say just make it legends, but this galaxy being official canon would draw people in. So they could add tiers. Canon tier 1 would cover anything  that is confirmed to have happened in the Star Wars universe. This would include Movies and TV shows that are currently canon, and some of the books/comics that they choose. Then there would be Canon tier 2 that covers anything that is confirmed to have happened in the Star Wars universe, unless contradicted by Canon tier 1. And finally legend covers anything not confirmed to have happened in the Star Wars universe. This game would be Canon tier 2. This would solve a lot of continuity problems.

In ROTS, she hears of what Anakin has done and begs for him to leave with her, she only backs away when hearing Anakin talk of ruling the galaxy, but she begs him to stop and come back since then she would have to leave him, which she obviously does not want to do.

In the Clovis arc though, Padme sees Anakin beat up Clovis and ignore her pleas to stop. Padme later says she doesn't feel happy and safe to Anakin and wants to separate for a while, which is understandable since Anakin was pretty terrifying in that scene. The problem though is that this is Padme, who is willing to forgive Anakin for double child murder and forming an empire. Anakin himself is horrifed by what he did to Clovis but Padme doesn't accept his apology. In fact, it seems like if Clovis didn't betray Padme, Padme would not reconcile with Anakin and it would be the end of their relationship.

This arc seems to only prove that to Padme, seeing Anakin beating up Clovis nearly to death while ignoring her pleas to stop is worse than hearing of the killing of an entire tribe of sand people including children, killing the jedi at the temple including children and forming an empire which is she against. In fact, it seems to Padme that Anakin beating Clovis is just as bad as being a sith and dictator since both of these seems to be dealbreakers to Padme. Except, it seems like Padme would forgive Anakin for his deeds as Vader since Luke did and he is an extension of Padme. But it seems like Padme would not forgive Anakin if Clovis did not betray her.

Instead of just flat-out telling Luke that she is his sister and you should go save her (even though Luke probably wouldn't believe that.), it might have still got him curious. 

Sure, you could say that he lied about that so Luke would just go without questions (like with his Father), but it still feels weird. Ben was present at their births, he knows where both of them were sent, but now he grins and has no problem of them potentially getting together at that moment. 

Sure, he could've told them after (if he lived), but still, it's risky. Especially since ANH was more focused on Luke and Leia getting together instead of Han- which was obvious the whole movie.

84,The Clone Wars has replaced the Prequel Trilogy as the Original Trilogy's counterpart,1597575604,"I'm constantly thinking about what is the definitive story that Star Wars tells. The easy answer is obviously the *Rise and Fall of the Empire*, along with the *Fall and Redeption of Anakin*. But where do the boundaries of this story lie? One would be expected to say Episodes I through VI, but I think that's not the case anymore.

Even though the prequels have seen a resurgence in popularity in the last few years, we still can't deny that The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones are lacking as movies, despite portraying key events. And in contrast with the Original Trilogy, the story here is much less personal and more superficial. Anakin as a character only gets a few reasons to distrust the Jedi. While they are good reasons, you'd still have to think deeply about their impacts on him, which indicates incomplete execution of the intended idea.

It is a blessing then, that the story that the prequels indended and failed to tell well was in fact fully realized with The Clone Wars. With how impactful the series has become, we can even gloss over the events in TPM and AOTC as prologue, while the actual story of Star Wars is told within the series that spans:

40,Star Wars Had A Bit Of Everything. (Talking about some aspects of the world and my view on the Franchise),1597535618,"TL;DR: The original film had a very strange old-age style with a lived-in universe. The first film's story was pretty much complete. Leave Luke and friends and go visit another tale from the Star Wars universe. I talk about the film while giving my controversial opinion on the franchise. 

 Star Wars (1977) is a very strange place. On one hand, it has a lot of strange things such as mysterious artifacts, aliens, and weird buildings. Though, it does present itself in some type of SCI-FI-futuristic-form with lightspeed, spaceships, intelligent robots, etc.

It mixes old age living and practices (a princess, monarchy, etc.) combined with, what we would deem, futuristic, but most of Star Wars presents itself in a more retro-futuristic output.

The world of Star Wars, at least on the desert planet (or later to be called Tatooine), seems to be quite barren, but complex. Denizens don't have at their disposal any type of electronics. You don't see people with electronic devices out, you don't see people texting, making calls, doing any type of long-distance communication.

The technology (the computational aspect) barely exists. We seem to be at a point in the Star-Wars universe where technology is starting to rise, or the universe is in a dark-age. If you want to go in another direction, you could just say that Star Wars is stuck with the technology it has and could never advance in any significant way.

It is a funny conundrum. There are megastructures built in the universe such as the Death Star, large ships, space stations, but I seem to be, at least in quality of life, old-style- perhaps World War 2 themed.

If a person was to have a computer, it only serves basic tasks. It is large, clunky, and appears to be slow. The feel of it isn't exactly user-friendly, it speaks the 70s, of course. You could downplay half of this as, ""It was made in the 70s, of course, it will not be up-to-date with modern ways or technology.""

I wouldn't exactly find that true, even things like Star Trek seemed to deal with more advanced practices- especially modern versions. Things in Star Wars have a certain old-age feel. Everything feels ancient, the atmosphere is ancient, but it does contain a lot of types of tech at the same time.

There is no such thing as quality of life here, I don't bring in the other films or the prequels because I'm more interested in the original. I can watch the other films just fine, but from a more serious standpoint, I tend to decide that Star Wars was unique in its own right.

The original film wasn't focused on the Jedi or the Sith. It wasn't really even focused on the lightsaber. It was mainly a glimpse into this weird universe with a simple protagonist. Mostly every character you see that are not the main characters still seem to have a story to tell.

I could look at Greedo, the bartender of sorts, or the folk in the Cantina and run with ideas of their backstories. I got the impression that the film (story) I was watching was just one out of many. Luke Skywalker's story may not have been special in the grand scheme of things. You could have easily followed someone else in this story.

The world is either boring or exciting, you can make up your own mind on that. Though, I mainly think that that universe always has a story to be told. It doesn't need to be just, ""The Jedi vs. The Sith- and space intertwined in there."" as it is now.

When you think of Star Wars now, you think of the Jedi vs the Sith, lightsabers, the force, but I'm thinking more of the bigger picture. Instead of the sequels using the same formula, bring back old characters, turning the universe into a fantasy into the sense of two sides of the force battle, Star Wars could have been a sandbox of potential.

Instead of seeing Luke, or instead of seeing the force, or any of that. You could see new faces, a new religion (perhaps), new planet all in a more unique way that wouldn't speak the Star Wars we know. Tell me about a navigator on a spice freighter, or ancient civilization, a lost artifact, etc. Individual stories in there.  

The whole planet in the original had this Western feel to it. You could kill people, walk-off, grab a drink, etc. Mos Eisley seemed to be a place of scum and villainy- as he put it in his dramatic speech. I wouldn't mind seeing a story by some scum there. 

I just feel like Star Wars didn't have to be about Stars or the Wars. Like Splinter of the Minds Eye, you could get names that are their own story. 

I'm just saying, my ideals for a sequel to Star Wars (77) would’ve left Luke Skywalker (the hero of his own film that rose through the ranks in a fitting ending), and focused on another part of the galaxy. Perhaps someone in another weird sector.

I have no real ideas for this, since I can’t think of any landscapes that could really speak the original theme of Star Wars, but what I really wanted from a sequel trilogy (if there was to be any) was a totally different aspect of Star Wars.

I know lightsabers are very fun space-wizard swords, and I know force-powers are great. I know that Jedi VS. Sith is fun, but I don’t think that should be what STAR WARS is.

Today, when you think of Star Wars, you think of those things listed. I would’ve wanted another tale, basically. Perhaps another hokey religion- as said. Maybe not even to do with the Empire, Rebellion, or any of that. It would just be in its own system, with things there that are totally different.

 What I loved about the original was the old-style feel of it. Everything was ‘lived-in’. The technology wasn’t there. A land-speeder, though in some ways futuristic, was a hunk of junk. Tatooine (the ideal Star Wars landscape) was a wasteland.

What I didn’t like about the prequels is that they made everything look cartoony and ‘futuristic’ to the point of being like any other early 2000’s futuristic flick. There were flying cars, chrome everywhere, CGI animals, weird cities.

I never thought even the well-developed areas of Star Wars looked like that. I assumed it was more like Tatooine. This old-style mix of mechanized and old-style means of transportation. The living spaces had wear-and-tear, computers were just simple machines and were nothing special.

The universe Lucas did create was a very unique one. Darth didn’t have to appear anymore after the original. I liked to think he was just another guy living in this strange universe. He wasn’t anything special. Just an ant in this universe who might’ve liked to wear his space-helmet a little too much (it wasn’t implied he was a cyborg until after).

As I said, I think Luke Skywalker’s story was done. I don’t think Luke, at the end of the day, cared too much about the Jedi. I didn’t even see him with the lightsaber 90% of the film. He seemed to have acknowledged the lightsaber, but he did merely cast it aside because he’s seen weird things like that in his day.

The world wasn’t about the Jedi, the Jedi (if they did exist and it wasn’t some crack-story from Ben Kenobi) were just a small and insignificant religion that focused itself on cheap magic tricks and laser weapons.

The original Star Wars had a story. It had an ending to the cast of characters. Luke had finally got the taste of adventure he wanted. He got a beautiful Princess (and no, this wasn’t when they were deemed brother and sister down the line), he saved a couple of systems from this Empire, and he could live his life with more adventures if he wanted.

Funnily enough, Star Wars was over. It had an ending, and even though it would be deemed cliche or overdone these days, it was still an ending to that story. Now, it never ends. Even though it is fun, it doesn’t live up (unsurprisingly) to the one that started it all.

It’s not a perfect movie, by any means, but I think it is the most imagination expanding movie around. It laid the groundwork, but also was the only film, to me, that was there. Perhaps, it would’ve been better if it had stayed at one film.

At the end of the day, Star Wars had a lot of things. WW2, Western, SOME elements of SCI-FI, old-tales, etc. that I think aren't there with films after. It lost what I think should've been, a sandbox for whatever weird stuff you throw. Not on things now (the same plot thread, the same family, the same name.) Luke and friends were done. 

Han would've probably left after his little journey, the two droids might've left at some point, and everything's done for them. Let's go to the next bunch. The next aspect in Star Wars. What could've been.

74,Darth Sidious and Darth Nihilus are opposites,1597527811,"Utilization of the dark side often is a very big struggle. One is constantly vying for power because it's an addiction. I'ts either you use the dark side to it's fullest potential and contort it to your twisted ways, or the dark side uses you and destroys you completely. I think it's in full agreement that Darth Sidious is the culmination of all Sith. He is evil, conniving and is extremely adept in the dark side's abilities. He is, by definition, a true Sith. He enslaves the force and uses the dark side for power while honing a strong will that prevents the dark side from clouding his judgement like a number of Sith in legends. Nihilus is the exact opposite. His will deteriorated completely and he submitted to the dark side. Instead of taking control of the dark side, the dark side took control of him. Palpatine and Nihilus are examples on the outcomes of the dark side. Either you dominate it and use it, or it dominates you and you become it's slave. Palpatine is able to remain a master manipulator and a genius while Nihilus has lost his spirit entirely and is a force of nature. While Palpatine is the epitome of 'Sith', Nihilus is a manifestation of the dark side.

75,Am I making this scene up? Need help finding a scene...,1597527744,"Hey guys, so earlier this year I was working at a pizza joint and my boss had some Star Wars playing on the TV. I’m not a huge Star Wars guy so I had no idea what it was from, but it looked like something relatively new, probably from the Mandalorian, Rogue One, or the new trilogy.

Basically the scene was in the middle of a big battlefield, but the thing that really caught my attention was there was a guy (I think he was a Rebel soldier? A captain I think? I can’t remember) and he was climbing over a trench dual wielding blaster pistols and it was really badass the way he was shooting. I think he was spinning the guns between every shot so he kinda looked like a cowboy and shooting down guys left and right. I can’t remember who he was shooting though. I would assume clones cus those are always the guys getting shot but my memory is hazy and I don’t even know if clones are still the bad guys in Star Wars anymore lol

But how would a galactic civilization standardize years for all planets? Are they using the year of Coruscant as their galactic proxy? 

To further complicate things there are now actually multiple galaxies in the Star Wars universe, at least including Besh/Firefist and the Rishi Maze.

97,The Rise of Skywalker is NOT a retcon of TLJ.,1597519807,"There were safeguards in place to make sure Rey Nobody or Rey Somebody worked regardless. Both in canon and established in TFA.

Maz’s words to Rey about her knowing the truth about how they aren’t coming back were intentionally left vague because while Abrams and Johnson were using Lucas/Arndt’s treatments as a broad(and I do emphasize broad) trajectory they left safeguards mainly the one above, and a couple in the novelization in place for that sole reason in case one wanted to go a different route. The overarching trajectory was plotted out but the individual filmmakers would fill in the gaps. 

Abrams was toying around with Rey Somebody as interviews he gave around the time he stated her lineage would be explored in IX. There’s also the very subtle things like music, cinematography, and fighting style that allowed for either option to be explored.

We know Johnson ultimately chose Rey Nobody, backed up by Maz’s words in TFA. Because that was the way Star Wars needed to go, not the nostalgia pandering way. And for reasons unknown to us fans, although we have our theories, Abrams went back to his vision. It’s not a Retcon because of the Maz clause lol, remember safeguard.

As for the in canon safeguard: Rey was only 4-5 y/o. Shes letting her abandonment issues and insecurities cloud her perception of her parents. They’re nobodies because Rey doesn’t like herself very much and projects that onto their image. It’s not a retcon. Remember truth depends on our point of view. Rey truly thinks “they abandoned me because I must be a horrible wretch” so therefore in her mind they are as well.

First of all, i get if those arguments where there when only original series was there, but now? After the prequels, the Clone Wars series? It is not really obvious who is the bad guy, the Separatis have legitimate reason for not wanting to be with Republic. For example, through the entire Clone Wars series (well, except for the first season season, mostly), morality of decisions and choices is being questioned (for example when Anakin, Ahsoka and Ayla crashed on that world whose people did not want to fight for their freedom, because they thought that was the right thing to do). Also, Jedi role in the war has been a problem for the entire series, most of them agree that they should not be warriors, but they are forced to do so.

Also, even the Jedi/Sith clash isnt so black and white as everybody says. Sith are not really the bad guys, they are just people who have a different point of view of how they should use the force. Also, Jedi order isnt so flawless as it is thought to be, with all their ban of emotions and strict dogma. Hell, even Vader, who is meant to be the villan, turns out to be more of a hopeless, tormented soul, and he still fulfils its prophecy of saving the day. Count Dooku has also been explained not to be really a villan, just someone who saw threw the dogma of Jedi order, got frustrated with corruption in the Republic, and wanted to make thing right in his own way.

Also, you get a lot of political aspect of the show, with all the negotiations, mercy missions, planet sieges, blockades and occupations. Senator being blackmailed, hunted, corrupt, and even killed.

Also, its not everything about the Jedi and lightsabers. Clones, droids and their armies, their equipment, their fleets, all of it has so much material to explore.

Here's why I think that movie is the perfect introduction to Star Wars:

* It's a good movie in its own right, and it got better reviews that *Solo* 
* I noticed that people who don't like Star Wars as a whole tend to like *Rogue One* a lot.

* It depicts the outbreak of the Rebellion, which is a natural place to start.

* It's obvious what's going on, in the same way as *Episode IV*. The guys who look like Nazis and blow up planets are bad.

* Unlike *IV*, you don't have to look past the awkward 70s visuals. Unfortunately, I think the film's 70's-ness is a big obstacle for first-timers.

* Starting the OT with anything but IV is a bad idea.

* Starting the PT with anything but *Episode I* is a bad idea.

* Unless you're already a fan, you're probably gonna hate *Episode I*.

* The sequels are well-made, but they're fanservice for people who already love Star Wars.

49,Chronological Timeline of all Movies and TV Shows,1597509112,"I made a timeline including all the main movies and side movies and the TV shows including Forces of Destiny as I feel it contains interesting moments. 

Some of the timeline overlaps specifically Forces of Destiny has episodes that overlap with the events of main movies. I didn't want my timeline to require myself to stop in the middle of a movie to watch an episode of a show that takes place alongside the movie. The movies have been given priority as they are the main part of the stories and any TV episode that takes place at the same time is placed after the movie. 

I'm also aware that Rebels has an epilogue that takes place after the original trilogy however I didn't feel like it was necessary to place that episode after the movies just because of that. So if you follow the timeline you'll see the epilogue before watching 4, 5 and 6.

If there is any mistakes feel free to point them out and hopefully you appreciate it.

50,"To those who think Rey is overpowered, why?",1597509035,"From the arguments I've heard, I don't see how any of them point to her being overpowered. 


-Starting with her first use of the force, mind tricking the guard. She was under incredible duress, and it not out of the element of star wars at all for force powers to emerge from those kinds of situations. Being the granddaughter of Palpatine, Sheev's first use of the force was choke slamming his father, and inadvertently murdering the rest of his family. Although having someone tell you about and training you to use a certain power no doubt helps, it is clear that the force grants a certain type of intuition about one's abilities. 


-Next is the claims that she beat Kylo, despite having no training. If you rewatch the fight between them, Kylo was an emotional wreck from killing his father, and had a blaster wound in his side. He wasn't fighting like a trained Sith against Rey, he was angrily slamming his lightsaber. The entire fight is Rey on the defensive, running away and barely blocking his attacks. He also said he had no intention of killing her. That is by no means ""beating him"". 


-Many people say force healing is overpowered and way too convenient. Are we forgetting the fact that Anakin was born because Palpatine and Plagueis manipulated the force to literally create life? If you can use the force to create life, healing life is not nearly as ridiculous as that. 


I probably missed somereasons, but I invite anyone who thinks she is overpowered to mention anymore. The force has always been pretty ambiguous, and I think for good reason, and I've never seen how there's any concrete way to label someone as ""overpowered"" so long as they're not doing some Goku shit or something.",StarWars,Elodaine,False,/r/StarWars/comments/iaaev9/to_those_who_think_rey_is_overpowered_why/

80,Biggest problem with the ST.,1597503092,"While all the ST has many flaws, I think the main on that really makes people hate it is the resetting of the universe to just Pre-ANH, as well as the seeming shrinking of the galaxy. 

The ST could have gone is any direction it wanted to, and had untold freedom when compared to the PT, that had to end when the Ot began. Instead they opted to pretty much just undo the victory that was earned by RoTJ and just reverted back to pretty much the rebels vs empire, while ruining the ending of our original hero’s with putting in any real leg work to explain it. Han is back to being a smuggler, Leia is still in the rebels, and while having the rank of General, from what the movies she doesn’t really do a whole lot, and Luke is just a shell. 

You also have the shrinking of the universe, where everything just seems like a stones throw away. In TLJ during the 18 hour space chase, Fin and Rose go to Canto bight, spend an undefined amount of time escaping and freeing some weird horses and returning to sneak into a FO ship. Rey seems to spend days on Ahch-to, only to return in time to fight kylo before the resistance get to Crait, and the resistance just limps through space to a planet that happens to be close by to where they first Hyperspaced to. 

Then in TRoS despite only have 16 hours our hero’s visit 4 different planets, all while having to spend some significant amount of time on each only to still somehow face Palpatine with time to space.

All this really does is make the universe seem really small and really contrived. For all the faults the PT had, the one thing it did really well was expand on the universe.",StarWars,Servant-Ruler,False,/r/StarWars/comments/ia8nqq/biggest_problem_with_the_st/
