He‚Äôs never really likeable or have qualities that make you want to root for him and really view as a good guy or heroic guy.  In fact I‚Äôd say he was pretty grey in a sense that he did more bad than good before his fall .  Just needed more of Anakin being a hero.

59,Why was Anakin able (allowed?) to become one with the Force after being so damn evil?,1597464268,"There‚Äôs all this talk about Anakin being a victim of the Dark Side and ultimately his actions as Vader are absolved in his next life in which he‚Äôs one with the force. But while he may have been manipulated by Palpatine and the Dark Side, *he* is the one who made all those choices. 

How can so many in the series and fanbase separate him from Vader? It just seems like a way to pull the blame off Anakin by acting like he‚Äôs a different individual, but he‚Äôs not. Anakin never stopped being Anakin, not really. And to say that he did is just something Anakin and Obi-Wan tell themselves because they can‚Äôt accept the truth: that Anakin spent his whole life fighting his angrier, darker nature only to let it become all he was. Maybe it started out of desperation, but in the end that‚Äôs just who he always was underneath.

It‚Äôs true, he gave the ultimate sacrifice. There‚Äôs no true redemption for him but that‚Äôs as close as you can get really. Still, how could he become one with the Force when, despite his internal conflict, he is at his core aligned with Dark Side?

I‚Äôd like to note Anakin is my favorite character in the franchise. He‚Äôs so tragic. As much as a happy ending for him feels good, I can‚Äôt help but feel wrong about him getting one as good as becoming one with the Force after all the atrocities he‚Äôs committed.

89,I think that the yoda species is the light side equivalent of the sith species. And that there has to be a dark side equivalent to the force priestesses,1597454763,"We all know that the force must be balanced. 

We know that the force wielders are a balanced system. The light represented by the daughter, the dark represented by the son and the middle is the father. We also know that the bendu is in the middle. The force priestesses are very light side aligned. though you could make an argument that they are also in the middle because the summon dark side illusions, but they are just that illusions, and the teach yoda and qui-gon how to become force ghosts which is a life side ability as far as I know. Because the force must be balanced there has to be a dark side equivalent of them. 

And then a level down we have species. The sith species are very much so naturally drawn to the dark side. There would have to be a light side equivalent of the sith. I say it would be the yoda species. They could even be the reason the Jedi are called the Jedi. Though through the millennia the name could haBe Ben altered. Mabey the name of the species is the di-je or something like that. The di-je would be naturally pulled more to the light side. Though this depends a lot on how they are raised.


We know the sith are extinct and that is due at least in part to their tendency to kill each other.  As as a result of the extinction of the sith, The di-je also almost go extinct.  due to their long life span their would be little need to procreate very much. So they go nearly extinct, there are only the known di-je in cannon. at least two others would have to exist, they would be the parents of the child.

You might be asking what about the middle ground, there has to be a middle ground. I think the middle ground would be humans. Not naturally pulled one way or they other, due mostly to a very low percentage of humans would be force sensitive. But they ones that are not naturally pulled to one side or the other. They are groomed by one side but that is not the natural alignment of the species. This explains why the chosen one is a human. The one who brings balance would come from the species that is the middle ground in terms of the force.

I saw a theory a while ago that stated that the child is the light to anakin‚Äôs dark. Reasoning behind it is that they were born in the same year And darkness rises and light to meet it. 

 What would be the dark side equivalent of the force priestesses?    What are your thoughts?     How wrong am I?",StarWars,private_jimmy1,False,/r/StarWars/comments/i9ynev/i_think_that_the_yoda_species_is_the_light_side/

Basically, ESB revealed Leia was a force-sensitive and ROTJ retconned that Leia is Luke's sister, making her Vader's daughter. But during a New Hope, Vader was all up and close to Leia for the opening and Alderaan's destruction. So I'm wondering ""Does he know she's force-sensitive and if he does, why doesn't he do anything with her?"" To the Empire, any force-sensitive is a potentially dangerous threat to the Empire and must either be recruited or killed.

47,Recently realized that Kylo wouldn't have learned about the First Order untill after having left the temple and joined Snoke and the KoR,1597441271,"So in TFA we really didn't have much knowledge about Kylo other than he was known as the Jedi Killer and kept his grandfathers burnt helmet atop the ashes of those he had killed. We didn't really know how long ago he had fallen or when he had joined up with the First Order.

Then in TLJ we learn that according to Luke Kylo had turned some of his students and had left with them after killing the rest of the academy students. A action that makes it seem like he was already working for Snoke and would have known about the First Order. (The fan theory that he was behind the letter in the napkin bombing also made people think he was already in touch with the first order). 

But then we get the Rise of Kylo Ren. We don't really know when it happened. It could have been concurrent with Bloodline or anywhere up to a year after it. So we don't really know how much Kylo knows about Vader during the book. But what we do know is that the First Order hasn't revealed themselves. 

The Centrist planets don't secede and start calling themselves the First Order only to be joined by mysterious ships from the Unkown Regions untill a year after Bloodline and after Luke has already left for Achto according to the TFA VD. 

So that means when he joins the KoR and meets with Snoke he would have then been taken and introduced to the First Order commanders. 

That would have been a wow moment. You just saw everyone around you killed (and killed one single already defeated Jedi that was going to die anyways) and ran off with this creepy old man only to be introduced as the grandson of Vader to this huge fleet you never even knew existed. 

Personally I liked it better when Kylo knew about the FO and actively subverted some of his fellow students to the cause because of his obsession. But it shocked me when I realized he wouldn't have known about the FO or even possibly his grandfather when he fell and that Luke wouldn't have known about them when he left for Achto.",StarWars,TheMastersSkywalker,False,/r/StarWars/comments/i9uyt1/recently_realized_that_kylo_wouldnt_have_learned/

Now, first I want to say that this isn‚Äôt a complaint. We ended up with Palpatine in the end and that‚Äôs that. The point of this post is that in the common tradition of fairytales the female lead has a female villain. It‚Äôs just a tradition, though not a necessity. I don‚Äôt think there was a female villain in the versions I know of Beauty and the Beast. But there‚Äôs Malificent in Sleeping Beauty, the evil queen in Snow White, the evil stepmother in Cinderella, the sea witch in the little Mermaid.

It‚Äôs just one of the traditions just like how the absent father is good and the present father is bad.  Vader is the prime example of that. So who do you imagine that could have been? Not a creative idea, but possibly‚Äôs Palpatine‚Äôs daughter or if Rey had an evil twin.

So me, my brother, and my dad were watching Clone Wars yesterday and we were watching the episode where Ahsoka begins her siege of Mandalore and my dad noticed something. He says that Rey's theme plays when Ahsoka lands on the platform. Right after the explosion goes off behind her, you hear the notes A D E, ascending order, in the same rhythm as Rey's theme. Here's the link to the video and it's at 1:14! It's very subtle but it's audible.

https://youtu.be/3Vum5BQP5k0

Now, I personally don't believe this. My dad says that they put it cause Rey and Ahsoka are both female and that Disney has become ""predictable."" After my dad explaining his theory to my mom, she said that they did because of the ""6 degrees of separation."" For those of you don't know what that is, it's basically where they make a connection from one person to another because of, maximum, 6 people between them.

25,Do you think Jar Jar was meant to be a Sith Lord?,1597380230,"Full disclosure: I‚Äôm not a prequel guy myself. I loved them growing up but they don‚Äôt do it for me anymore, just my opinion. 

Every now and again I‚Äôll revisit Phantom Menace for nostalgia, since that was my favorite one growing up. I‚Äôve debated the jar jar theory for years and even fallen on different ends of the argument, but on most of my rewatches (which are almost always Star Wars marathons with newcomers to the franchise) I never think about it mostly because I‚Äôm so bored with the film I don‚Äôt care to have an opinion one way or the other. 

Anyway, I was skipping through some scenes on my dvd not too long ago, and‚Ä¶ I think I really buy the whole Jar Jar Sith Lord theory. Even putting aside all the drunken warrior and Yoda comparisons‚Ä¶ it just narratively makes sense.

As much as I don‚Äôt care for the prequels, none of the films ever put heavy focus on something for no reason. If a big character was set up, they always had a pay off of some kind, and served there overall function of the story. Jar Jar has SO much screen time, and he‚Äôs present for way too many pivotal events that end up being relevant for the rest of the saga.

I just don‚Äôt understand why Jar Jar would have so much screen time here and barely take up five minutes of AOTC. Effectively or not, he‚Äôs part of the communal cast of characters, and it seems pretty obvious to me that they meant to do more with him at least until the next movie. 

I don‚Äôt think it would have changed the way the trilogy concluded or anything like that. Revenge of the Sith comes off as a film that was more or less George‚Äôs vision for a very long time. Attack of the Clones‚Ä¶ does not. I wouldn‚Äôt be shocked to learn that Jar Jar was meant to be the villain of that movie and not Dooku.",StarWars,KevinSpaceysGarage,False,/r/StarWars/comments/i9fm71/do_you_think_jar_jar_was_meant_to_be_a_sith_lord/

I was inspired to make an original concept for a blaster pistol. I thought it would be interesting to use the principles of the prop teams from the original trilogy. So I chose to use an old weapon / flare gun as a base (like many of the other blasters in Star Wars). I chose the ""Walther Model SLD - Signal und Leucht"" and sort of iterated from there.

I already purchased the ForceFX and it doesn't work, tried to get it replaced but Amazon wants me to do a return and repurchase and the price has gone up, plus after having time with it I'm not sure how much I like this with the LED Strip down the blade, the replaceable batteries versus rechargable, and I'd also really like to be able to change the colors of the blades.
I'm sure there's something out there that I'm missing since the ForxeFX is able to be on the cheaper side, plus there's the YDD/Kybers/SaberStudio are able to do pretty close to what I want except they don't have the crossguard.

Toss me the name of a character you really like, big or small, major or minor, and I'd love to do a sketch of then for you and post it on this sub! I'm not changing anything, I just want to make some people smile!

Mods, if this is too much of a ""self-promotion"" type thing, or breaks any rules, I totally understand. Don't hesitate to delete it, I'd hate to that 'that guy'.

43,Dark Disciple is fantastic,1597348066,"I've finished reading Dark Disciple, and it was so freaking good.  I'm on the fence as to whether it would have worked as an arc on Clone Wars.  The show went to some surprisingly mature and dark places, but I think this kicked up a notch.  There is a sensuality in the story that I just don't think would have come across as effectively in the confines of the Clone Wars animation style.

But seriously, it's awesome.  I'm trying to keep this spoiler free here...basically, it is a really good study of how the war takes the Jedi to places that are against their moral code, and the sacrifices required for that.  Which was a big point of the cartoon in general was showing the flaws and corruption in the order, and this story really hits it home.  To be clear, this story is a tragedy (not of Darth Plagueis the Wise).  So you have to be prepared for that tone going into it.  It very well written and compelling, I couldn't put it down.  If you liked the show and are interested in more Vos and Ventress, I highly recommend it.",StarWars,starlordtheoutlaw,False,/r/StarWars/comments/i96uh0/dark_disciple_is_fantastic/

49,My love of legends content and Star Wars has brought me to write this.,1597346796,"So to begin I love everything Star Wars from the original trilogy and the  media that came with that to the brand new trilogy and the bumpy road that was I love it all and as of today I see alot of new and interesting forms of Star Wars entertainment coming up to enjoy that excites me but I need to get my mind across in regards to the treatment of the Star Wars licence by Disney and how closed it is to freedom and creativity by the community especially in Legends

This has been bugging me for some time now and this topic is going to mainly be on the outside content of Star Wars known as Legends here is where my annoyance stems from. To begin many people absolutely love the comics and games from the golden age of Star Wars where games like Jedi Knight Academy and KOTOR exist and comics from Dark Horse were loved and enjoyed by many this time for Star Wars was amazing and enjoyed by many fans myself included to say the least I want Star Wars to be like this time where games and content were everywhere for any comic reader or gamer to enjoy. When I heard KOTOR was being remade I was excited and really looking forward to it but then I heard the news that Disney sent a cease and desist order and that dream was crushed. I then came up with an idea.

Why not have Legends be a semi open book for the Community/ Companies to add to!

Allowing an open form of media for any Star Wars content creator to add to would allow for the community to thrive more than it is now and bring us to a content filled Star Wars future! By allowing a more open legends legendary games such as KOTOR could be recreated with far less legal issues and far more creative freedom as long as the proper rights from outside sources were obtained. If Disney could loosen restrictions on legends content and allow for extra forms of Star Wars media on top of the best of the cannon stuff from Disney there would be far less community backlash to removing content from the main cannon. On top of that what I would love to see from Disney is to watch them take from the world of legends and add it to the main continuity with the proper agreements of course.

A few examples: 
1. If an indie developer were to recreate the KOTOR games and take the proper step legal steps this game could thrive in legends and maybe become cannon in the future with enough community support.

2. If a indie studio were to make a game that obtained a huge following and the game were to not fit in the main timeline they could still thrive in legends and have it's following there.

This type of community interaction is what Star Wars really needs! A community driven focus for Star Wars centered around giving this massive community what they want even if it isn't apart of the main timeline.

Few extra points:

The Legends Content would need a starting point to be decided upon I would suggest one of the following two:

The First one is centered around adding additional content to the Universe and trying to keep it clean which is kind of impossible.

The Second one gets rid of all Disney content and return to the original timeline keeping things perfectly separate the problem is nothing will be added to this one.

17,"The reason behind the split in the fan base (in my opinion, obviously this is a big topic)",1597332450,"Obviously a big title, but hear me out.

Personally, I really didn‚Äôt like the sequels. I‚Äôm going to try and be fair in writing up this opinion, so please don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm coming at this from an attack POV. I‚Äôm just getting my opinion out of the way. That‚Äôs how I feel, but I don‚Äôt think it will matter as far as discussion goes.

I think it comes down to what we as fans prioritize in the story. I see the split as one between those of us who prefer the lore/world building aspects of the story, and those of us who enjoy the more thematic aspects. I‚Äôm not saying either side simply doesn‚Äôt care about the other, but rather what we look for in a story. It‚Äôs just a demonstration in difference of priorities. 

I‚Äôll give an example: 

I‚Äôm firmly in the camp that lightspeed should take a certain amount of time and be consistent in universe, whereas some people figure it should just suit the story. If that means it‚Äôs instantaneous, so be it. To some fans, the consistency in FTL travel time matters. To some, it doesn‚Äôt as much as insofar it suits the story being told. 

I didn‚Äôt like Holdo‚Äôs lightspeed maneuver because it‚Äôd never been done before and didn‚Äôt seem lore friendly, a lot of people don‚Äôt care because it‚Äôs more about the story than the mechanics to them. 

Another example:

I personally didn‚Äôt like how fast Rey picked up Force/lightsaber skills, because again I didn‚Äôt think it lore friendly, and I love the lore and world building aspects of Star Wars more than the more thematic and interpretive side. A lot of people didn‚Äôt/don‚Äôt care, because her being that level of power is what‚Äôs needed to suit the story being told.

Third (final) example:

The witnessing of SKB being able to be seen from Takodana is perhaps the best example, because it‚Äôs so contained in the story and serves as demonstrative or both POV‚Äôs. I didn‚Äôt like how they were able to see the blast in real time, as it would take many years to be able to see it from that distance across the galaxy. A lot of fans, however, don‚Äôt care about that sort of thing, because the emotional payoff of getting to see our characters witness such an event is prioritized over something as dry as real life physics. 

I‚Äôm not here to debate the sequels, I just wanted to suggest why there‚Äôs such a divide in the fan base, in my opinion. I didn‚Äôt like them, but (particularly) after coming to this conclusion, I can see why people do. I cannot stress enough how much I‚Äôm not saying that either side only cares about world building/themes, again, it just seems to be about prioritizing consistency in lore (for lack of a better term), or the emotional story. At the end of the day, I‚Äôm just happy to be able to discuss a series I‚Äôm sure we all love.

44,"Rewatching the PT and TCW, Padme losing the will to live makes sense me to considering she is pretty weak and selfish when it comes to Anakin",1597327905,"  In AOTC, while Anakin and Obi-Wan say Padme would do her duty on the gunship, she fails to do her duty twice by not telling anyone of the sand people and marrying Anakin due to her love for him.
  In TCW, she trades Grievous for Anakin even though it can the end the war since she loves Anakin. She also doesn't tell anyone Anakin beat Clovis even though she gets upset at him since she still loves him and is fine with him by the next episode.
  Then in ROTS, her reaction to learning Anakin has joined the dark side seems stronger than learning of the empire. Then on Mustafar, she confirms Anakin has killed children and formed the empire, and begs for him to leave with her. She was that desperate to have him and even says she only needs his love. Then in her dying moments losing the will to live since Anakin joined the dark side, force choked her, and became everything she fought against and probably could not cope with it, all she does for the twins is birth and name them. She doesn't even tell Obi-wan to take care of them or anything. On the other hand, she asks Obi-Wan if Anakin is alright and says in what seems like a last-second realization that Anakin still has good in him, but by then it is too late for her body so she dies. 
 Due to this, it seems pretty obvious that compared to her love for Anakin, her love for the twins is way lower since she can't live without Anakin and barely seems to care for the twins as she dies. Padme is strong in a lot of ways, but she is as obsessed as Anakin is with her and weak when it comes to him.",StarWars,DoctorSpider3,False,/r/StarWars/comments/i90lye/rewatching_the_pt_and_tcw_padme_losing_the_will/

75,How Luke can instantly connect to the Force.,1597270858,"Maybe there‚Äôs something I don‚Äôt know from the books or other mediums, but the concept of cutting yourself of the Force was introduced by Lucas when they were making The Force Unleashed. He was involved in that game and said that many Jedi went into hiding after Order 66 and gave Jedi who became farmers as an example. They were able to hide themselves because they wouldn‚Äôt use the Force anymore, they didn‚Äôt train anymore and that would eventually lose their connection to the Force. 

This is what happened in the game to General Kota once he got defeated by Starkiller. Now obviously that game isn‚Äôt canon, but to me whatever George Lucas says is canon. It may not be to you who weren‚Äôt fans of prequels or the changes in the OT. So to me this begs the question how Luke was able to connect to fast again to the Force in TLJ. At least if the same logic applies. That would require him to train hard again to connect himself to the Force, just like any other Jedi.

Chris avellone, the lead writer of kotor 2, expressed a similar opinion on how he liked the ideas of TLJ but not the execution.

My point is that TLJ seems to adopt very similar ideas from KOTOR 2 of how that the wars between the Jedi and sith are pointless, and that maybe Adhering to these ideals are the reason that the galaxy is plunged into war. I was really happy to see these same themes pop up in TLJ because KOTOR 2 is so incredibly written that it practically is the gray area of Star Wars. I really think TLJ was trying to do the same thing KOTOR 2 was, but used wayyyy too much humour with all the horrible jokes cracked. KOTOR 2 had a set atmosphere of horror and the feeling that the Player character was truly alone in the galaxy while being hunted by the sith. If TLJ were to be less humorous I really think it could have had the same praise that KOTOR 2 got. Nonetheless I‚Äôm happy these ideas were presented in TLJ because I‚Äôm not the biggest fan of the typical good versus evil conflict.",StarWars,TheBigMons,False,/r/StarWars/comments/i8ni18/anyone_else_notice_tljs_ideas_are_similar_to/

5,There is another Skywalker,1597264483,"I've recently watched The Clone Wars S06E13 ""Sacrifice"".  Force Priestesses tells Yoda that ""There is another Skywalker"".  I was very confused at first but when I watched that scene again, I concluded some possibilities that it might refer to.  


1. She might be referring to Padme's pregnancy. Referring to Luke as ""Another Skywalker"", as the one who will bring balance in the force by turning back his father to the light side.  

2. Yoda repeats after her but in a different manner ""There is another................ Skywalker"". From what I heard, it felt like he was struggling &amp; it was more like his last words as we see in ROTJ. This becomes more clear when Yoda asks ""Died have I?"" and the priestess replies ""In a way"".  

3. After Yoda repeating her words, we can hear a classic breathing sound of Vader, foreshadowing that ""Another Skywalker"" to be present within Annakin, i.e. Darth Vader.

10,"This is probably an unpopular opinion, but I think the duel on Mustafar is highly overrated.",1597263453,"The duel between Anakin and Obi-wan centers around the idea that both combatants know the other's fighting style perfectly. This is why the two seem perfectly matched despite Obi-wan constantly being on the back foot. He knows he can't beat Anakin head-on so he stays on the defensive, waiting until Anakin slips up. This is a brilliant idea, however, I don't think it's executed very well. For one, the choreography doesn't feel like these are two people trying to kill each other. It's flashy and exciting but it lacks weight. Additionally, for the most part, the fighting lacks character. when fighting, the two don't have distinct styles. A good example of a distinct fighting style is Kylo Ren. He swings his saber like a broadsword; every strike is heavy, impactful, and visceral. However, Obi-wan and Anakin both just spin their sabers around. That's not to say there is no character in the fight. Obi-wan is constantly on the defensive and Anakin incorporates punches and kicks into his fighting. But for the most part, it's just generic fighting. Finally, there are some moments in the fight that don't make sense. Anakin's dropkick, that weird part where they spin their blades but don't connect, fighting while swinging from ropes, but the worst one is when Anakin and Obi-wan both force push each other. This moment demonstrates that they are fighting in perfect sync but it shouldn't be possible. There is no way Obi-wan should be able to match Anakin in strength with the force. He's fighting defensively because he knows he can't beat Anakin head-on, yet this moment suggests otherwise.

I don't hate this fight, I really don't. I'm just tired of seeing it praised as the best fight in the series. I feel like people get caught up in the incredible music and the emotional significance and don't notice how meaningless most of the actual fighting is.

We saw the series around Season 5 when my Dad had back pain long ago. It was a rollercoaster of emotions. My Dad got happy when missions were successful, he was excited when Anakin tapped into the Dark Side, and he was disappointed and sad from the death of Fives, Ahsoka leaving the order, and Rex turning with Order 66. He saw a bit of Rebels so he knew Maul and Rex would live, but he didn‚Äôt remember Ahsoka. This led him to be at the edge of his seat for the entire last arc. He has a greater understanding of the Star Wars Universe now, which makes me appreciative that he wanted to share this passion. His favorite story lines were the different and best written ones. The Siege of Mandalore Arc, the Fives Arc, Maul‚Äôs Rule of Mandalore, Yoda‚Äôs Arc, Umbara, Ahsoka‚Äôs Frame Arc, and the Father‚Äôs Arc were all favorites. Now he‚Äôs been satisfied with this whole journey and all of its connections to the movies. We didn‚Äôt skip a single episode, which means we went through the good and the bad.

(Without animosity, just discussion)",1597250602,"If you'd like to add I only ask that responses try to stay free of things like ""The PT Was trash anything would have been better than what we got"" or ""The DISNEY TRILOGY is a joke""  etc.  I honestly would like to see what people think without turning this into a slugfest. 

Anyway...

I've never really agreed with the starting point and general path of the prequel trilogy.  I've come to accept it and appreciate it for it's additions to the franchise and the eventual spawning of The Clone Wars series etc but I've always felt a little cheated by the way they were put to film.

I am in no way saying that this story would have been better than what we got, just kind of what I wished for. 

In my head I always wanted to see something like

Episode I - Anakin Found as a teen/young adult with checkered past that was found to be powerful and Obi thought he could bring anakin into the order and it change him for the better while also allowing him to grow into a powerful jedi.  Shows his struggles in training and learning to be a part of the order with reluctant acceptance that he would do his best to conform. Ends with the start of the Clone Wars

Episode II - A few years deep into the clone wars.  War has wreaked havoc on anakin's feelings and personality but he is powerful and a great friend to obi wan as they are brothers in arms.  Flashes of his turn and the beginning of the emperor's hand in his fall to the dark side.  He learns of Palpatine's status as a Sith but keeps the secret from the Jedi because of his growing distrust of the Order while deciding which path to take. 

Episode 3 - The jedi cause Anakin to lose something dear to him and the with pushing from palpatine his anger begins to control him.   He pledges his allegiance to in secret palpatine because of his distrust and anger toward the order.  Palp executes Order 66, Anakin betrays Obi Wan directly on the battlefield.  Epic duel ensues.

I know it's not what we got and I know a large portion of the fanbase has either grown to enjoy or always have enjoyed the prequels, but I always go back to thinking that this is the way i would have liked it better.",StarWars,Backpacks_Got_Jets,False,/r/StarWars/comments/i8h5wf/what_do_you_think_is_the_weakest_addition_to_the/
60,The story of Palpatine's rise to power is my favorite part of the prequel trilogy and Clone Wars.,1597249318,"I actually prefer the Clone Wars show version of all the characters even Palpatine. The prequels are flawed and all but I consider them super risky and probably the start of the villain protagonist trend in pop media.

I think two missed opportunities were not showing more background and character development for Palpatine in TPM, another was that the one single thing EVERYONE wanted and expected from these films was seeing the bond between Obiwan and Anakin during the clone wars, and we barely got it until the show. This was the one vital thing the prequels needed.

The scene in Clone Wars where Palpatine sheds his chancellor roleplay to go take care of a problem was a highlight of all Star Wars media for me, just wonderful.

28,Baby Yoda‚Äôs birth parents?!,1597228593,"So from what I‚Äôve been reading about I really do think ‚ÄúThe Child‚Äù could be in fact Yoda‚Äôs and Yaddle‚Äôs child I just find it odd the in attack of the clones she is just suddenly gone out of the order and disappeared possibly due to child birth?? Just speculation for me but from the timeline of starwars to ‚ÄúBaby yodas‚Äù appearance in Mandalorian it seems quite feasible. Now I don‚Äôt mind spoilers of any nature it doesn‚Äôt ruin the show for me at all. (But I have not seen anything from the Mandalorian television show due to me being lazy and procrastinating on watching it) now seeing that baby Yoda is ‚Äú50‚Äù years old I don‚Äôt know how accurate that is and I don‚Äôt know if they actually tested or found out his age on the show (again never watched it) so it makes a lot of sense if yaddle  went into hiding to give birth and to possibly raise the child for a short while. Taking in account if she died right after childbirth or gave the child away? I don‚Äôt know so please any and all STARWARS fans, fanatics or knowledgeable lore brethren please help enlighten me and this discussion to further my knowledge on this subject! Also if you have any speculations about the subject or have any ideas about where the Mandalorian and the child were during the new trilogy I am very interested on your ideas and opinions!

48,The Clone Wars,1597218115,"This is my first post to the community so I apologize if this post is not fit for the rules of the sub, all i want to do is inform fans of a wonderful discovery I‚Äôve recently made.

My career has made me a lover of audiobooks and yesterday I discovered ‚ÄúThe Clone Wars‚Äù by Karen Traviss. I‚Äôve always been a Star Wars fan but I have never really had the opportunity to watch The Clones Wars movie or TV series, both came out when I didn‚Äôt have access to seeing either. I walked into this audio book unaware of the content being based on the movie. After listening to the audio book and watching the movie I just have to say.... If you enjoy audiobooks get your hands on this! 

First off I know it‚Äôs a book first and foremost, being so it provides so much more depth to the characters involved. Getting to hear the thoughts of everyone really makes you see them in a more distinct light . Secondly for being an audiobook , it has an amazing voice actor and background effects that emphasize the actions of every scene. Transforming a short movie into an 8 hour incredible radio drama.

I‚Äôm anticipating the release of the next two books on this format and until then I need to go thru the TV series. I‚Äôve always heard good things about it.

TLDR: if you enjoy The Clone Wars movie and have about 8 hours of time on your hands, find the audiobook version and you will be treated to a much more in depth story.",StarWars,pH325,False,/r/StarWars/comments/i89k3n/the_clone_wars/

For the longest time I never really liked the prequels or sequels until the Skywalker Saga ended.

I‚Äôve come to appreciate every movie including The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones, The Last Jedi, and The Rise of Skywalker which are popularly the least favorites.

I used to be a sheep when it came to opinions, where if a plethora of people didn‚Äôt like a movie, I didn‚Äôt like the movie. Now that I‚Äôve realized that being a sheep is bad, I formed my own opinions in that I truly love Star Wars in all of its glory. Every movie I watch, I don‚Äôt watch to critique, I watch to have a good time. If I continue to chastise these movies, that will form a bond of dislike to a franchise that is dear to my heart, and I certainly don‚Äôt want to make my relationship to these works of art bad.

**(2)** 4-inch regular action figure size. 

I have a box of each kind. These are Original and Prequel Trilogy era toys, the Prequel toys would have been made in tandem with the release of the films so circa 1999-2004 or so.

My hope is to give them to a child who will really appreciate them. I don't need details, but ideally they would go to a kid who maybe doesn't get very large Christmases, etc.

19,How Rise of Skywalker should of started...,1597190123,"I‚Äôve always had this vision in my head especially before Episode 9 came out, since my friend had told me there were rumors of a young Luke and Leia being in the movie and my hype got extremely high but we obviously know how that went. But yeah, I decided to share this now since I got Reddit back in January so here we go... 




So right of the bat, this movie does not start with an opening crawl, it just hops right into the action and that‚Äôs it. You‚Äôll see why that is in a bit.
The movie starts off with a young Luke and Leia training, we get a whole lightsaber duel and all that. The planet is a forest type planet but on a open field, with it being a sunset setting. We see some awesome moves made by the two, but see that Leia clearly out does Luke and gets the upper hand. She eventually gets him on the ground and says a smart remark whilst helping Luke get up. Luke then applauds her at how fast her training is as she‚Äôs really good, I mean she is a Skywalker after all. Luke then exclaims how he‚Äôs excited to bring the training to higher standards, to where they can start a school together and bring about Jedi‚Äôs again. But then, Leia gets this concerned look in her face and looks away...






Luke is confused and concerned asking if he did something wrong, but she goes on to say it‚Äôs not him it‚Äôs something else. Luke then looks confused and that‚Äôs when she looks up towards Luke and says ‚ÄúLuke, I‚Äôm pregnant.‚Äù With a smile. Luke then takes a while to process it but eventually pulls off the biggest smile ever. He gives her a huge hug, saying congratulations and is excited to be an uncle. He immediately says ‚ÄúI understand if you don‚Äôt wanna train anymore, please focus on your new baby it‚Äôs fine.‚Äù She then gives him a kiss on the cheek and says thank you. We then hear a ship and the camera shows the sky, and we see the millennium falcon and they land, so Luke and Leia go walk towards it. We then see Han and Chewie exit the ship and everyone‚Äôs all hugging and what not, with Han saying his smart remarks and what not. 





Luke then congratulates Han I‚Äôm being a father and Han gives this shock look and immediately looks at Leia. She then smiles and says ‚ÄúI thought it was the right time we told him Han.‚Äù Han then chuckles and says ‚ÄúWell it‚Äôs about time we settle down eh?‚Äù And everyone laughs. Han then says how he hopes they have a boy, with Leia also agreeing. Han then asks Luke ‚Äúif we had a boy, what should we name him?‚Äù We then get a wide shot of the gang‚Äôs back, and they‚Äôre facing the huge beautiful sunset so we‚Äôre seeing that as well. We then get a close up shot of Luke‚Äôs face, with the sun shining on him and seeing his beautiful eyes. We start to hear the Star Wars theme in the background but a super subtle theme, like you can barely hear it. He then chuckles and says ‚ÄúHow about Ben?‚Äù then smiles.

69,*Fan Story* Dilemma Concerning the State of the Galaxy and the Jedi Order after TROS,1597181088,"As the title says, I have a dilemma

I've been writing two fan-made stories (for the sake of this, we can call them fanfictions) and was hoping that, when they were done, I could send them to Disney to maybe have them published. This is in no way for me to try and publicise, but one would basically take place in the Old Republic (ship type, names aren't familiar, new planets, Republic V Sith Empire, etc.) but was wondering: Since The Old Republic timeline is filled up to the brim and there's no gaps (I'd prefer this to fit in with canon), should I just make it 2000 or so years into the future? Or should I try and fit it into the Old Republic Days. I also wanted to use a model of the Ebon Hawk and that was discontinued during TOR timelines.

Problem is, I'd also want it to have another flawed Jedi Order, one where rules and preservation of the Order superseded the Will of the Force. But seeing as Disney made it so that Rey would seemingly create a ""perfect"" Jedi Order, idk if that would work?

Don't get me wrong, I understand that this had to happen for the original trilogy to make sense, but I always feel so sad after watching ROTS because its so sad how Padme dies and Anakin doesn't seem to think about what he's doing. I can't explain the feeling, It just feels so incomplete.

0,Differing opinions over the name ‚ÄúAnakin‚Äù for my best friend‚Äôs child.,1597153670,"So first off, I‚Äôd better establish that I realize that my opinion on the name has no weight, as it isn‚Äôt my child that might potentially be named ‚ÄúAnakin.‚Äù Anyway..

My best friend and his fianc√©e found out a few months ago that they are expecting, and recently found out that it‚Äôs a baby boy. My girlfriend and I were recently asked to be the godparents. One of their top names for their kid is ‚ÄúAnakin.‚Äù 

My gf and I had a discussion after we heard the news, and we had some differing opinions. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I am a HUGE Star Wars fan, and I actually have always loved the name ‚ÄúAnakin‚Äù. However, I really feel like telling my buddy that his son having that name might invite ridicule as he‚Äôs growing up. I dunno if times have changed, but I always got the impression when I was younger that nerddom names were kinda looked down upon and a bit cringy. It‚Äôs not my kid, but the guy is my closest friend and I will be the kid‚Äôs godfather. Maybe I‚Äôm overstepping my bounds here.

My girlfriend is also a big Star Wars nerd, and actually found the name ‚ÄúAnakin‚Äù to be quite sweet. Her reasoning was that Anakin, despite falling so far and forsaking his friends, was ultimately redeemed and saved by the love from his family, Luke. Now, i get that and all, but I‚Äôm just concerned for the kid growing up.

What is the general consensus about the name ‚ÄúAnakin,‚Äù and am I just overstepping?

TL;DR best friend wants to name his son Anakin. My gf and I are godparents. Gf likes the name and meaning behind it. I think my godson will get teased.",StarWars,GreyJedi90,False,/r/StarWars/comments/i7s4ny/differing_opinions_over_the_name_anakin_for_my/

27,What is your favorite moment from each trilogy?,1597149506,"We all have our different opinions on which trilogy in the Star Wars Saga is the best, but there is no denying that each film has a scene that made an impact on us, regardless of how we feel about the overall film. 


For me, out of all the prequel trilogy, the fight between Qui-Gon Jinn, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Darth Maul stands out as the best moment from those films.

For OT, you have a lot more moments to choose from. ""I am your father,"" I think will always stick with me. I don't even remember how old I was when I first saw Empire, maybe 3 or 5? and my god did it blow me away.

For ST, I think the best scenes are from Force Awakens and Last Jedi. Rise of Skywalker might be my least favorite out of all the movies but there are still some memorable scenes, Bens redemption with his father is probably the scene that stands out the most for me. But, for my favorite scenes, the Kylo/Han moment on the bridge in Force Awakens is great, but I personally think the fight between Kylo and Rey at the end of Force Awakens is one of the best lightsaber fights I've seen in a Star Wars movie.

4. When Finn hears these screams he looks UP. If from Maz's place he would have looked that way.

89,Star Wars Original trilogy inconsistency,1597122226," The original trilogy is one of the best cinematic stories ever told, and the amount of detail and effort put into it is unmatched. My favorite of the 3 movies is The Empire Strikes back, and in the 170 something times i have watched it, something has always bugged me‚Ä¶ When Han enter the carbon freezing chamber, he had shackles tied around his arms, seen in picture one and two.

&amp;#x200B;

[Shackles in TESB that are seen right before the carbon freezing](https://preview.redd.it/7x65io9i2bg51.png?width=673&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=873017effa535d05975898344760351a40eefeb6)

 This alone doesn‚Äôt bother me, it's the fact that in his next on screen appearance in Return of the Jedi, his physical features remain unchanged, but the shackles somehow disappear. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Solo's next appearance in ROTJ](https://preview.redd.it/vnp2fb7o2bg51.png?width=810&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c34263fe53f58f13c4bd4a6f61c7c1be8c59c206)

This has bugged me for the longest time, and I just wanted to share this with you guys.  I have a few theories on why this happened in universe and out. In universe answer: The most reasonable explanation is that during the carbon freezing, the shackles were somehow petrified and broken, so when emerged from the carbonite in ROTJ, they seemed to have disappeared. Out of universe answer: I feel like the most obvious answer is that costumes/props made a mistake, and that it was an accident. The costume they used in TESB is different from the costume in ROTJ, I can see a difference in lighting, but that might just be me. The way Solo is positioned in the carbonite makes it os you can‚Äôt see the shackles, and I think that it just got overlooked. I would love to hear your guys idea/thoughts on this, I‚Äôm really bored and have nothing better to do, I hope you enjoyed my little rant. :-)",StarWars,jonny066,False,/r/StarWars/comments/i7lljc/star_wars_original_trilogy_inconsistency/

Finn continuously suffers from PTSD stemming from the brainwashing. He keeps having nightmares. Wakes up in a sweat with a blaster in his hand. Furthermore, in battle he zones out and has flashbacks. During one of these ""zone out"" moments he winds up killing a soldier of The Resistance. After the battle he is taken into custody, not realizing what he has done. The Resistance has no choice but to ban him and send him away. 

Finn, now on his own, is on a mission to cure his mind in order to get back to The Resistance. 

I'm not sure how or what he would do to ""cure his mind"". Maybe you have some ideas?

But eventually after healing fully from the brainwashing, Finn goes on his own little quest to take down The First Order (kill Kylo Ren). This is where he and Rey dramatically run into each other. Rey can sense through the force that Finn is healed which makes way for Finn to get back with The Resistance.",StarWars,_-_Starlord_-_,False,/r/StarWars/comments/i7dmng/finn_alternate_character_timeline/

31,Lightsaber Colors,1597086282,"This is something interesting I was thinking about, but what if different lightsaber colors are the result of different energy wavelengths emitted by the kyber crystal and that specific ammount of energy, that the kyber crystal emits, is affected by whatever force user is wielding it. IRL, visible light is only a tiny part of the whole electromagnetic spectrum, and ranges from red with the longest wavelength and lowest energy to blue with the shortest wavelength and highest energy, hence why cooler objects tend to be redder and hotter objects tend to be bluer.  Perhaps the colors of lighstaber blades also work the same way, with the kyber crystals inside blue-bladed lightsabers emitting the highest energy and the kyber crystals inside red-bladed lightsabers emitting low energy.

Jedi who wield blue bladed lightsabers tend to be skilled warriors and are in-tune with the light side of the force, and because these Jedi are so strong with the force, the kyber crystals they are bonded with emit the highest ammount of energy and glow a bright blue. Green light has a slightly longer wavelength and lower energy than blue light, and many Jedi who wield green lightsabers such as Asokha; Yoda; and Qui Gon were not the most skilled when using force powers in combat, but prefered to use them for other means.

White is caused by all the color wavelengths being combined. Those who wield white lightsabers, tend to be gray Jedi or non-affiliated force users, and like how white is a combination of all colors, these Jedi may use all aspects of the force to achieve harmony.

In canon, red lightsabers are said to be caused by the kyber crystal ""bleeding."" This implies that the kyber crystal may have ruptured and be dying, and this makes sense with my theory, since a dying/""bleeding"" kyber crystal will be emitting much lower energy and will be emitting deep red light. 

Finally we arrive at the dark saber, a jet black ancient lightsaber crafted by a Mandalorian. Black is the absence of any color at all, hence why it is so good at absoring light and heating up. A lightsaber that emits no light, is one whose kyber crystal has completed died. We dont know that much about the ancient history of the dark saber, but perhaps the theft of the dark saber by the Mandalorians and removal from the strong force-senstitive Jedi created a reaction in the kyber crystal that killed it",StarWars,ComprehensiveMartian,False,/r/StarWars/comments/i7b799/lightsaber_colors/

A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away  
 on a distant planet dwelled  
 a slave named Anakin  
 who had no father, but a mother he loved well  
 Until one day, a Jedi master with flowing locks  
 with his padawan rescued Anakin  
 but unfortunately, not his Mother  
 and thus fear was placed within  
 Strong with the Force, the Master requested to train  
 ‚ÄúToo old he is, a Jedi he cannot be‚Äù  
 the Master pleaded and pleaded but in vain  
 Soon a Sith lord attacked him  
 stabbed him in the gut  
 The training duty passed on to the padawan  
 and the Sith lord fell half cut

Many years later, entrusted to keep the Queen safe  
 the young Jedi Anakin fell head over heels for her  
 But felt a great pain when his mother‚Äôs shrieks were heard  
 rushed to the sand people, only to find his mother murdered  
 in anger, he massacred not only the men  
 but the woman and children too  
 yet inside, suffered a great mental torment  
 then the ruthless Clone Wars began  
 the Republic clones versus the enemy droid army  
 and after surviving a great battle  
 Anakin weds the Queen secretly

And there he was in the sky  
 gunning down droid ships with a cannonade  
 and on the land, great friends  
 with the Chancellor, he made  
 but dark dreams he had, of his wife  
 dying at childbirth  
 and thus sought counselling from a wise Jedi master  
 ‚ÄúFear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hate leads to suffering‚Äù  
 but unsatisfied, Anakin was as before  
 The chancellor offered him relief  
 when he told him the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the wise  
 save his wife from death, Anakin can  
 but is possible only in the Dark Side  
 Anakin learned the Chancellor is a Sith lord  
 mentioned it to a Jedi master with a purple blade  
 the master attacked the chancellor  
 but Anakin needed him  
 so with a striking blow, killed the master  
 The chancellor, now the Emperor  
 was happy at Anakin‚Äôs betrayal  
 Rewarded him with the title *Darth Vader*  
 and told him to be loyal

Order 66 was issued to the Clones  
 where they turned against their Jedi Masters  
 and ordered them to be shot  
 as traitors, the Jedi are considered hereafter  
 The Clone Wars is over!!  
 but what a crushing defeat  
 not to the enemy, not to the clones  
 but to the Jedi and the galaxy  
 The Jedi temple was raided  
 by Vader‚Äôs personal legion  
 hundreds of Jedi were killed  
 and children were slain by Anakin  
 Anakin‚Äôs master followed the Queen to Mustafar  
 where Anakin last arrived  
 Anakin, now a fully-fledged Sith  
 did not tolerate his master and wife  
 Choked his wife to the ground  
 and faced a great duel with his Master  
 ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs over Anakin, I have the high ground!‚Äù  
 and in defeat, a burned Anakin fell down  
 The Emperor found Anakin alive  
 and save him with a black attire  
 and while people mourned at the Queens‚Äôs funeral

62,"I enjoy all Star Wars, why is that wrong?",1597081954,"I‚Äôll admit it‚Äî I enjoy all Star Wars. Be it what is now legends or the new canon, I enjoy it all. Do I have different levels of enjoyment? Sure. Because despite all of the amazingness, each installment does have something wrong with it as nothing is without flaw. I would like to preface this to say I mean no insult to anyone, but i am simply observing. (To help me, I‚Äôm going to go into a kinda list mode so I can keep track of it all.)

1‚Äî Star Wars is designed for younger audiences. Not to say it‚Äôs meant only for kids and can‚Äôt be enjoyed by all, mind you. It can house mature themes. Think of kid shows like Suite Life of Zack and Cody or Batman: The Animated Series. They are aimed for kids, true, but they sneak in so many adult messages or jokes that it‚Äôs endearing to everyone. That‚Äôs the theory of George Lucas and Dave Filloni,  both of whom have talked on it, and interviews with Freddie Prinze, Jr (Kanan)‚Äî who has also talked with Lucas in the topic‚Äî day as much. The stories mature as you go through the series/ trilogy and when you circle back around, you start to notice things you didn‚Äôt before. So it doesn‚Äôt have to start dark and gritty, but it might have some.

2‚Äî It‚Äôs never going to satisfy everyone, but like any good story it‚Äôll try to get as many as possible. This is true for everything, but I feel it‚Äôs especially important regarding the sequel trilogy. My best friend despises the sequel trilogy and other new stories because it undid Legends. But circling back to the ‚Äúthemes kids can follow thing‚Äù, the reason they did that was to reach a larger audience. Not everyone has read all the books on Darth Bane, they don‚Äôt know anything of Luke‚Äôs Jedi order and the Youzong Vong, so you can‚Äôt start up in the middle of that whole series. The technology to de-age actors is still fairly new and yeah, Samuel L Jackson looked great in Captain Marvel but Clark Gregg was eh and there would be riots with re-casting. 

3‚Äî Disney didn‚Äôt ruin the franchise, but they could‚Äôve handled it better. Keep in mind that a lot of the creative minds involved in the movie making process were ones that had already been there. Kathleen Kennedy, who many like to blame, was hand-picked by Lucas due to her immense repertoire and the work she did with him on the prequels. They consulted with Lawrence Kasdan, they talked with original ILM folk, everything. The problem comes from trying to mimic another franchise they owned but didn‚Äôt fully grasp at the time‚Äî Marvel. They tried to run Star Wars like Marvel and put at least one movie out every year and didn‚Äôt give it enough time to fully plan the stories. They thought the head creative team could be switched up without any communication whatsoever. So yes, the sequels to me are still fun and enjoyable, but lack the larger themes of the original and prequel. But they‚Äôve learned from this as evidenced by The Mandalorian, even brought in Kevin Fiege to help. They realize what was wrong and now they‚Äôre working to make sure the fans are more happy in the future. Speaking of which...

4‚Äî The Zealots. Let‚Äôs face it, some individuals in the fandom may as well be Senator Kelley from the X-Men, hating on what isn‚Äôt ‚Äútheir‚Äù Star Wars with intensity rivaling a fire and brimstone preacher. I understand being a fan and wanting to take ownership over a franchise, but it‚Äôs not the brainchild of yours and you don‚Äôt get to determine how it comes out. Many will throw in fan service, that‚Äôs true. But just because something didn‚Äôt go the way you want means you can bully the actors into nearly committing suicide (Ahmed Best with Jar Jar Binks), forcing them out of acting despite them being a child (Jake Lloyd), erasing social media entirely (Daisy Ridley and Kelly Marie Tran), and so many other things. Ironically, their actions in this sense is part of what affected Star Wars so much. Yes, Disney didn‚Äôt have as much of a plan as they should‚Äôve and didn‚Äôt let the creative proceed how they wanted. However. After the backlash against the prequels, they kept the franchise safe and made TFA like New Hope. When there were complaints it was too similar, they took it an entirely different direction with TLJ which caused more anger. So they relied on fan service and didn‚Äôt take the risks we had seen in some beautiful concept art for TROS. Again, had there been more of an overall plan, maybe things would‚Äôve been different. But the zealots ‚Äúdid that [them]selves.‚Äù, to approximate the Obi-Was quote.

And finally...

5‚Äî THE WHOLE FRANCHISE IS FOCUSED ON PLOT CONVENIENCE AND MIGHT GET EXPANDED LATER. This is the one I need to drive home. Between the consist inaccurate displays of the passage of time in ALL the movies, the ‚Äúwe were in the area‚Äù nature of Anakin and Padm√© on Tatooine, the port in the Death Star, the Ewoks being little fuzzy warriors, books still intact on Ahch-To and NOT turning to dust upon being touched despite lack of weather proofing, the Force granting the perfect ability at the perfect moment IN ALL TRILOGIES, the existence of coaxium, a pillar perfect to throw down on enemies, contingency plans a la Batman for is any clones every figures out Order 66 early, etc. The whole. Of. Star Wars. Is. Based. On. Deus. Ex. Machina! And is waved away with explanations that don‚Äôt always make sense or aren‚Äôt covered until later. ‚ÄúHow did Maul survive?‚Äù ‚ÄúOh, well lightsabers instantly cauterize the wound and his hate just kept him alive.‚Äù 
‚ÄúBut what about the times when there‚Äôs blood everywhere from Obi-Wan?‚Äù 
‚ÄúOh, that species can‚Äôt cauterize it‚Äôs blood.‚Äù
It‚Äôs like a freaking D&amp;D campaign when the DM contradicts something and has to explain it away! And yeah, it‚Äôs fun to find what they do to retcon things or have the perfect moment. But ya know what? I‚Äôm fine with that. Because the franchise is still fun, all of it.

TL;DR‚Äî Why hate when everything has a flaw, there‚Äôs also good and decisions behind the scenes rely heavily on what happened. The hate people give off ended up ruining their own favorite franchise despite said franchise having numerous convient moments that make no sense and are hand-waved away.

70,Saving Rose Tico... by killing her...,1597079914,"My household has been discussing the many flaws with the latest trilogy an how they might have been improved. One issue, obviously, is Rose. We think the best way to fix her, is to kill her. I don't know if this idea specifically has been discussed before. Hear me out.

 I have to say first that I feel so sorry for the backlash that actress Kelly Marie Tran got. She played the part that was written for her, but people too often attack the face of the character, and not the writer responsible (though I know the writer got plenty of backlash as well). It's clear that she was meant to have a much larger roll in *The Rise of Skywalker* and that fan hatred got her sidelined to just over 1 minute of screen time. Might as well take her out of *Skywalker* all together and kill her in *The Last Jedi.* Here's how. 

Because we're only going to fix this one thing in *The Last Jedi*, everything stays the same up to the Battle of Crait. I know there's a lot to fix elsewhere, but we're only talking about Rose right now. So, the Battle of Crait, the battering ram cannon come out and begins charging up. Resistance ski speeders line up to make a run at the cannon but Poe calls them off. Finn stays on course and others yell at him over the radio to stop. Now comes the change. Rose pushes her fighter forward again after Finn and we see her line up a shot at Finn's ski. She fires taking out the ski and Finn's speeder crashes to the ground, spinning out and away from the cannon's beam. He's down, but unharmed and he screams into the radio as Rose now lines up in the beam. We hear almost the same lines as the original.

Finn: ""Rose! No! Why did you do that? Why did you stop me? What are you doing?""

Rose: ""I saved you, dummy. This is how we're going to win."" There's a pause. As the light from the cannon grows more intense, Rose is illuminated, glowing as if with radiant light. She reaches up to hold her necklace and continues speaking, ""Not fighting what we hate, saving what we love."" She closes her eyes, touching the necklace. This mirrors her sister's death from the beginning of the film. Maybe with her final breath she says her sister's name. 

BOOM! The cannon fires an instant before Rose reaches it. The beam continues on, cutting a hole through the wall, but the wreckage of Rose's ship is carried forward by momentum into the mouth of the cannon. The cannon is rocked with internal explosions. They got off one shot to breach the wall, but they won't get another. The film carries on as before from there. 

&amp;#x200B;

So there we have it. Rose gets to make a noble, *Independence Day* style sacrifice, she still gets to save Finn, still tell him she loves him (though in a broader, vague 'I love my friends and family' sort of way), and most importantly, avoids a horrible, awkward, kiss.

Let me know what you think.

77,Why Jar Jar Binks is actually Darth Plagueis,1597079328,"I think almost everyone knows the theory about Jar Jar originally being the literal ""Phantom Menace"" of the prequel trilogy, but many people believe that this is impossible after the introduction of Darth Plagueis the Wise in Star Wars Canon.

However, that can't be further from the truth. Darth Jar Jar, in fact, IS Darth Plagueis the Wise.

I know what you're saying. ""We've already heard this theory a million times. We get it, you zoomers like the Prequels more than the sequels. Grow up"". Well, actually, fair point. BUT I actually have logical evidence that not many people know about--

In a deleted scene from Revenge of the Sith, Emperor Palpatine thanks Jar Jar Binks for helping him rise to power. Well, chronologically, Darth Plagueis should be dead at this point. Palpatine murdered his master after becoming Chancellor, per the Dao of the sith. HOWEVER, in the Legends continuity, several sith have been known to live on after death using the transfer essence ability, allowing them to possess both living brings and inanimate objects.

Yeah, I know the Sequel fans are already grabbing their pitchforks to denounce the Legends universe. ""It's not canon anymore! Your theory might've been valid before the Disney acquisition, but now anything related to the Extended Universe has been RETCONED. You're correct, the Legends continuity is now, unfortunately, non-canon. HOWEVER, the transfer essence ability is actually 100%, without a doubt canon...

In the Rise of Skywalker, Darth Sidious used this same technique to survive his initial death at the hands of Darth Vader. He transferred his soul into clones of himself periodically, as his strength in the dark side caused each clone to degenerate at an accelerated rate. This means that Palpatine managed to transfer his essence not just ONCE but possibly DOZENS of times. It's also common knowledge that Darth Plagueis was aware of the transfer essence ability and was even capable of using it, but he initially avoided using it.

Therefore, not only is the Darth Jar Jar theory still valid, but it's very likely that Jar Jar Binks is, in fact, Darth Plagueis the wise possessing the body of a Gungan outcast to destroy the Republic from the inside.

Yeah, I know that the Rise of Skywalker might not be the best movie in the world, but if this is the price to pay to make Darth Jar Jar possible, I think it's worth it.

88,My Theory about Kit Fisto. He‚Äôs alive.,1597077795,"In Timothy Zahn‚Äôs, ‚ÄúHeir to the Empire‚Äù he explored Jedi cloning themselves. The practice of cloning force sensitives was not 100% accurate, and could lead to other problems. Many fans have noticed the difference if Kit Fisto‚Äôs looks between episode 2 and 3, leading me to believe the Kit Fisto that fought chancellor Palpatine was a weakening clone. And the real Kit Fisto, abandoned the force or was soon killed after Order 66.

 I suggest that Kit Fisto was not the only Jedi involved in this cloning experiment. Shaak Ti. The running joke of Shaak Ti dying could have a reason other than creative difference. One of the clones could have broken out, and have later gone off to fight Galen Marek.

The reason for these clones would be to go on possibly fatal missions that would mark the end of the Jedi order, leaving the original Jedi to try and save the order.

7,Does shielding on Alliance fighter craft ever actually play an explicit role in media apart from the games?,1597074620,"I suppose its common knowledge around here that Alliance fighters typically possess shielding, life support, astromechs, hyperdrive, sensor scramblers, air conditioning, power steering, cruise control, anti-theft deterrent, and AM/FM radio. TIE fighters have their own innovations like the solar panels on the wings or the twin ion engines themselves, and they do have specialized models, but the main rock-paper-scissors models (TIE LN/SA/IN) all lack the shielding and life support XYAB-wings have and are flying soda cans in comparison (I apologize to the empire's supporters).

But aside from being a gameplay mechanic in x-wing, rogue squadron, battlefront, ect. Does shieling ever actually play a role in the franchise other than informed ability?

We know the alliance needs to protect the lives of its fewer but skilled pilots ,and survivability as a rebel pilot is much higher compared to Imperials that use swarm tactics to overwhelm opponents. So because TIE pilots are expendable The Empire spends no extra money to protect them. But in the films just about every close up shot we see of the various Alliance pilots are right before they get blown up due to the somewhat triple-burst-like fire of the regular TIEs cannons or the fully-automatic-esque quad lasers of interceptors. - if they show a starfighter on either side in any era get hit, that pilot usually dies. The only discernible difference is that rebel pilots live long enough to scream and crash while most TIEs have been shown to combust.

The only three exceptions i can think of to this rule are all in New Hope where Wedge is hit once and has to leave, Luke is hit i think twice...maybe even three depending on which version of the movie it is, and Vader's Tie Adv is not only crashed into by a wing-mate but I THINK it also ping-pongs off the trench wall and bounces out into space.

So does shielding actually play a role in ship-to-ship combat? Or is this just something to differentiate good/evil? Like is there a book, comic, or any media where shielding explicitly saved a pilot from death? Or the starship took hits and managed to continue fighting? The Millenium Falcon and Mandalorian's Razor Crest are classified as a light frieghter and gunship respectively, and so for this reason, they wont count.",StarWars,PizzamanCJ,False,/r/StarWars/comments/i77cs4/does_shielding_on_alliance_fighter_craft_ever/

13,Rebels Season 4 is some of the best Star Wars content I've seen,1597072098,"This show in general had a very tight and thought-out narrative, and this season especially had intricate resolutions to multiple story arcs.  We get fleshed out resolution relating to Kannan/Hera, Sabine and her homeworld, Agent Kallus and his past history with Zeb's race, every space pirate we've met so far, and Ezra's final lesson, to name a few.  I am amazed at how so many story lines were wrapped up and the respect the showrunners gave each one.  This season truly felt like an ending to a story.

&amp;#x200B;

The production value was cranked up for this season.  I always appreciated the cinematic shots of fleets in space in the earlier seasons, and this season took that to another level (I'd almost say Rogue One levels).  If anything, watch the first 5 minutes of episode 9 Rebel Assault.  You get a classic attack of rebel fighters  breaking through a star destroyer blockade.  The ship movements and cinematography are very similar to the space fighting in Rogue One.  It was moments like these that truly felt like Star Wars.  Additionally, there is some spectacular animation sprinkled throughout land combat scenes such as characters diving out of harms way in a quick, fluid motion.  Even these quick little bits gave the show added polish.

&amp;#x200B;

We get an absolutely baddass bounty hunter named Rukh.  In a galaxy filled with pride-centered imperial officers, we finally get a competent adversary that puts his job before himself and is clearly respected by his superiors.  It's refreshing to see an Empire character that's good at his job and and not admonished after a setback.

&amp;#x200B;

**Hard Spoilers Below**

Some common complaints I've seen revolve around Ezra's story and thin lightsabers.  

Ezra's arc revolved around liberating Lothal and finding his parents.  Both are common themes throughout all 4 seasons.  Ezra was always quick to act in the heat of the moment especially if the issue related to something Ezra was emotionally attached to (his lost parents, people on Lothal, friends).  Ezra manages to find a Force gateway that provides the opportunity to change moments in time.  When presented with the chance to save Kannan, Ezra strongly wants to save his mentor but realizes if he does, Kannan's sacrifice would lead to the deaths of all his friends and himself.  Ezra had to let that opportunity go.  Later, the Emperor entices Ezra with an opportunity to be with his family before they disappeared (essentially going back in time).  Ezra wants nothing more than to do so, but he knows this will undo all the Rebels have accomplished.  Again, he lets this opportunity slide.  It is here that Ezra realizes he can't get the past back but he can save the future of his people and friends.  To me, that's a satisfying character arc.  

&amp;#x200B;

As for the thin lightsabers, you have to get over it.  I agree they are too thin and look jarring, but after the first few episodes of the series you get used to them.  And, in Season 4, they do appear a bit thicker.  If you're whole reason for not watching this show is because of the look of a lightsaber, you are not opening yourself up to so much awesome Star Wars content, and that is a petty trade-off.

&amp;#x200B;

33,When did Anakin learn to become a force ghost?,1597067882,"Retaining your living consciousness after death is a force ability that is learned not something that just happens. 

Qui Gon Figured it out

Qui Gon Told Yoda

Yoda told Obi

I can only assume Obi/Yoda ghosts taught Luke

Luke Taught Leia

Leia / Luke taught Ben (no force ghost but he disappears and becomes one with the cosmic force)

I can't recall when Anakin had an opportunity to learn since there wasn't really an opportunity for Obi to teach him in life and it doesn't seem to be an ability the Sith know how to do or else you'd have these ghost wars of dead sith/Jedi popping in on people all the time like harry potter ghosts. 

in ANH Vader appears puzzled by Obi's disappearance when he's killed so you can assume he learned this after ANH sometime. 

Snoke/Palp don't know about it so you can figure that Kylo kept a secret from his master as well as Vader having to have learned it from someone other than Palpatine.

41,How would you fit the sequel trilogy into Machete Order?,1597066371,"I'm sure most of you already know what Machete Order is but in case anybody doesn't; Machete Order is an alternate viewing order for the Star Wars saga in which you watch Episode 4, Episode 5 and then you watch all of the prequels(technically, Machete Order was created with only Episodes 2 and 3 in mind, but I personally think 1 should be in there too) and then finish it by watching Episode 6. The idea being that the prequels serve as a flashback placed at the thematically fitting point where we had just learned that Luke's father, a former Jedi, became Darth Vader.

Machete Order was put together before the sequel trilogy came out though and so it recently got me wondering if there's any thematic way you fit the sequel trilogy into Machete Order or just sort of give it the ""Machete Order"" treatment and come up with an alternate viewing order that fits together well. Basically, this is what I came up with: 1,4,5,7,2,3,8,6,9

Episode 1: You see the very beginning of the saga with no previous events that impact the story. You're also introduced to Anakin, Obi-Wan, Yoda, Tatooine, the Jedi, etc. The story also doesn't really end with much of a cliffhanger other than Sidious is still around.

Episode 4: You're introduced to Luke, another person who lives on Tatooine who appears to be unrelated to Anakin except that he's being watched over by Obi-Wan and is strong with the Force.

Episode 5: You see the continuation of 4. It's revealed that there's romantic tension between Han and Leia. You're reintroduced to Yoda and it's revealed that the little boy from 1 eventually became the villain, Darth Vader, from 4 and 5. The story ends with a cliffhanger.

Episode 7: You're introduced to Rey, another seemingly unrelated young person on a desert planet(albeit not Tatooine). You're also introduced to Kylo Ren, Han and Leia's son who turned to the Dark Side after being trained by Luke. We know all about what the Dark Side is from hearing about it in 1 and especially in 5.

Episode 2: You're reintroduced to Anakin and Obi-Wan back in the setting of 1 but both of them are now significantly older. We start to see the beginnings of how Anakin would turn to the Dark Side and become Darth Vader.

Episode 3: You see the continuation of 2. Anakin's turn to the Dark Side is fully explored and Palpatine's role in all of it is revealed. We find out exactly how the Jedi failed in regards to Palpatine wiping out the entire Jedi Order and bringing the galaxy into the dark ages. We also find out how Luke, Leia, Obi-Wan and Yoda got where they were in 4 and 5.

Episode 8: You're reintroduced to Rey. She's caught up with Luke but Luke doesn't want anything to do with the Jedi anymore. Part of it is because of his own failure with Kylo Ren but part of it is because of everything that happened in with the Jedi Order's failure to stop Palpatine in 3.

Episode 6: You're reintroduced to Luke, Leia and Han in the setting of 4 and 5. Vader turns good again and Anakin defeats Palpatine. Luke and Anakin's stories are brought completely full circle.

Episode 9: You're reintroduced to Rey. Palpatine came back from falling down a pit somehow or maybe it was a clone, idk. Kylo Ren turns good again but Rey defeats Palpatine with the help of the spirits of all the other Jedi who have been in this series.

So, I don't know. If you do have any interest in watching the sequels again and want them incorporated into Machete Order in some way, that's probably how I would do it. It's the only way I can think that really comes close to being thematically fitting for the saga. Does anybody else have any thoughts? Is there a different way you would arrange it?

And Thrawn was my favourite character from the show, and after it ended i was left wanting more from him. Did some looking around and found this book... 

I loved the friendship between both Thrawn and Eli, it was a great match for both of them, both in the beginning when Thrawn was first introduced and up till the very end of the book and it felt like their relationship had evolved into a friendship. In certain situations when Eli relied on Thrawn like when trying to escape from the pirates with the tibanna gas, and when Thrawn relied on Eli, from the pirate attack against the afe clan dispute. 

The other main character was Pryce. With first seeing her in Rebels, i was looking forward to see her backstory in the book. I really enjoyed her climbing up the ranks of the imperial hierarchy and doing it by any means necessary to achieve her goal. Even if that means killing an ISB agent in the basement of her parents house to do so. 

Also loved some of the other characters including the return of Yularen, him helping Thrawn throughout the book, much like in the show. And also Nightswan, he was an intresting character with believable motives. The meeting between Thrawn and Nightswan in the field towards the end of the book was just amazing.

60,How do you feel about Solo: A Star Wars Story?,1597060999,"I originally avoided seeing the movie when it came out due to the hate it got right away, but decided to give it a try now and to be honest I was quite pleasantly surprised. 
While I'm generally not fond of recasting, young Han and Lando were pretty solid. The story wasn't the worst, action was fluent and mostly enjoyable, the visuals (as is true for all SW films) beautiful and the occasional humour didn't feel forced like it often does with modern movies. And even though it's leteraly a movie about one of the fan favourite characters, it unlike the sequels didn't try to stand mostly on nostalgia.
Not saying it was perfect, probably wouldn't make my top 5 SW films, but I can't help feeling that it got way worse reputation than it deserves...

There are plenty of things wrong with the character, but that doesn‚Äôt mean I hate the sequels, i just feel like if they had taken more time on them, then they could have been much better

Finn

I feel like Finn‚Äôs story could have been amazing. Having a stormtrooper come to realize that they‚Äôre not comfortable with what they‚Äôre doing and begin to rebel! But then making him laugh whilst he blows up other stormtroopers in the last jedi 

Poe

Poe was my favorite character in the sequels.
The way that he was such an honored pilot and did anything his superiors needed made him feel like sick a pure guy, until the last Jedi when he decided to go against the admiral of the resistance, which made him a lot less put of a character

53,Discussion: can and should Darth Vader &amp; Anakin Skywalker/ Ben Solo &amp; Kylo Ren be seen as separate people?,1597017636,"In discussions about Star Wars, Darth Vader and Anakin Skywalker (and Ben Solo and Kylo Ren) are often treated as entirely separate people, rather than different sides of the same person (i.e. this is Darth Vader doing that and here you see a bit of Anakin). In interpretations of TRoS it's said that Kylo Ren has to literally die so that Ben can come back. This seems kind of weird to me, because it makes the people in question sound like they have multiple personalities.
I get that choosing a new name is an integral part of starting a new life, but I don't think you can make such a drastic differentiation between Anakin Skywalker and Darth Vader (or Ben Solo and Kylo Ren). They are still the same person, with the same basic personality traits. Darth Vader (as in cyborg Anakin) is still deeply in love with Padme, is still a brilliant military strategist, values skill and bravery and wants to protect his family. Darth Vader is Anakin, just with a different name. (Same goes for Ben/Kylo: same person, different name.

I was wondering(throughout canon and Legends, whatever you like), what were the ways of imprisoning and containing a Jedi? I mean, it could be done, but Jedi have proved that they don't like being kept in cells. Anakin was kept in a cell in ""Dooku Captured""and only didn't escape because he didn't have a lightsaber. Bariss Offee was imprisoned by the Empire before she was encased in carbonite and died from the process. Vader attempted to imprison Luke the same way and later Luke accepted being imprisoned by him in the hopes of bringing Vader back from the Dark Side(though he didn't run before he was taken to the Emperor). There was the Citadel for imprisoning Jedi who had gone bad as well.

65,Darth maul surviving made sense in a way,1597012516,"Obviously they could have just let him die but him surviving on just his hatred for Kenobi makes sense.

When you think about it other characters have survived other near death moments. For example Anakin on mustafar. He had 3 of his limbs chopped of and then got set on fire severely crippling him. You might be thinking ‚Äúoh maybe it‚Äôs because he‚Äôs the chosen one‚Äù but I believe he used his hatred, his fear and his anger to keep him alive for that long.

So back to maul. After he fell thoughts rushed through his head. He was the first Sith in 1000 years to be defeated. His master was all powerful, could teach things that were unheard of. He was so close to greatness, to ruling the galaxy with his master. Being in power. But it was all taken from him. He could feel all the dead Sith looking down on him. He was a failure. He lost everything in his miserable life but he had a chance to prove him self, to rule the galaxy with his master and who took that from him, Kenobi. He didn‚Äôt feel anything in that moment. Nothing but hatred and anger. It fuelled him. His life was ruined by Kenobi. He knew he had to escape and make his life hell. But Kenobi had defeated him. Who knew if he would do it again? He had to run and then think later. He needed the ability to move. He then fled to the planet he was on in clone wars and pieced together a pair of legs. He lived in spite of Kenobi. He no longer cared what happened to the Jedi or the Sith or the republic or the separatists. He only cared about that man that took everything from him. Stopped him from becoming all powerful. So he rested everyday for years with one thought‚Ä¶Kenobi.

99,Kylo Ren/Ben Solo is my favorite character in the saga,1596993395,"* Killing his father into thinking it would rid him of his pain, yet it only enhanced his pain (his duel with Rey proving this) is a great way to build up conflict.
* Him experiencing the exact same thing his father did back on SKB is a great way to redeem the character. Where both Ben and Han walked down a large platform in an attempt to turn the one they care about onto their side.. and end up getting stabbed in the chest. This also adds more weight to the reunion between him and the memory of his father as he had not only undergone the same thing his father did trying to turn him, but also understood the meaning of Han's last moments with him -- the unconditional love of a parent, which also juxtaposes Kylo's relationship with Snoke.
* Him being part of the Skywalker-Palpatine dyad with Rey, destined to bring an end to both their past generational and familial sins by using the same force power their grandfathers once showed interest in, but by using it as acts of compassion instead of selfishness (we also see the effects of force healing by selfishness when we are introduced to Palpatine's corpse-like form in TROS) is a wonderful expansion of the force.
* Kylo's conflict in the ST is posed as the direct opposite of Anakin's in the PT. Where Anakin felt the pull to the dark, Kylo, in this trilogy, felt the pull to the light.
* I love how Kylo's helmet and lightsaber define his predominant characteristic: conflicted and largely unsure of his actions.
* Every single one of the original trio dies in an attempt to turn him back (Luke's was more indirect, though)
* It's also great how he finishes what his grandfather started (and what turned him dark in the first place), stopping the woman he loves from death by, as mentioned before, using the same power his grandfather showed intrigue in.",StarWars,ShambolicClown,False,/r/StarWars/comments/i6n0wf/kylo_renben_solo_is_my_favorite_character_in_the/

It was in the format of a letter to his superiors. (Possibly addressed to Vader.)

Other details I remember:  
The head of engineering declared himself as some sort of god.  
Travel times between sections were several days, leading to starvation in the camps the crew set up in the hallways.  
The command tower's windows were several kilometres wide and tall, which the writer considered impractical.

I apologise for the vague description. That's all I can remember of it and I can't find it again.

I‚Äôm going to be very proud and not get into that much details about this. I‚Äôll look into a few parts of the movie, storytelling, writing, character development, general entertainment and action.

Ok so the storytelling in my opinion is the best since empire strikes back. It was just so gripping and the overall feel of the story felt dark and sinister. Although I laughed at most the jokes in the movie, I totally understand why people didn‚Äôt like it, Star Wars was rarely one of jokes, and they did a lot of them in this movie, it worked for me, but I see how it didn‚Äôt for others. Character development was superb, by the start and end almost all the characters had learnt something knew about someone else or theirselves. This was one of the strongest parts of the story for me. General entertainment and action was superb. There wasn‚Äôt too much to the point they didn‚Äôt focus on the story, or too little to the point I thought I was boring, a perfect mix, plenty of action throughout the film especially in Crait, and the throne room is one of my all time favourites scenes

First 2 prequels weren‚Äôt good, however I didn‚Äôt mind phantom menace, ROTS was good, not perfect, just the best out of a bad bunch. After seeing all 9 movies in the cinemas I must say the prequels were probably the most dissapointing for me. I still think ROTS is set in the most badass time, when the separatist and empire are taking over, however that movie is not beyond a 8/10
It‚Äôs cool, especially the end but in terms of storyline it‚Äôs very weak and has some bad dialogue. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it‚Äôs probably one of the most entertaining due to the constant action and cool scenes, but the storytelling isn‚Äôt on par with the originals or sequels, perhaps ROS.

I saw this guy everyone saw as a hero a depressed, pessimistic mess because of his own failures. Which is something most people go through at one point or another. The film is about him coming through and learning to forgive himself through his experiences with Rey.

I can't speak for any of you, but that really hit home for me as I myself have been in that situation and have seen so many of my friends and family there too.

First of all, poetry does not have to rhyme. A lot of classic or traditional poetry does rhyme, yes. But a lot of poetry does not rhyme. Most poetry today (if not all) does not rhyme.

And second of all, rhyming is something that happens between words. It is the correspondence of sound. How can movies rhyme unless the dialogue rhymes? They can‚Äôt.

63,I‚Äôm 18 and I just watched The Revenge of the Sith for the first time,1596947050,"My God what a series!!

First off, the entire story is just pure quality. You just feel that the story is one and there seems to be no plot holes at all (at least, I‚Äôve seen none). Everything is so well rounded!! There‚Äôs only one other case in which I‚Äôve seen this, and that‚Äôs in The Lord of the Rings. That‚Äôs a whole other series though, and I don‚Äôt want to compare the two, because I believe that Star Wars stands apart. 

What strikes me is that every movie is so different. I loved watching each movie because I just didn‚Äôt know what to expect. There is so much to the story that I don‚Äôt really get why they would make VII, VIII and IX. I feel like every character I‚Äôve seen so far has a mind of its own and a perspective that‚Äôs worth delving into. I just don‚Äôt know why Disney thinks it‚Äôs a good idea to add new stuff to the story, because there‚Äôs already so much to the original series. Maybe I‚Äôm being ignorant, because I haven‚Äôt seen the new Star Wars movies yet. I have heard great things about The Mandelorian though, and I‚Äôm excited to start that series. Getting to know the origins of Yoda is exactly what I want, and I look forward to getting some more context to the Jedi Order. 

Lastly, I do not want to watch more Star Wars movies if they are not good. The six movies my brother and I watched this summer are so artistic and beautiful that I‚Äôm scared to screw that up with a sucky sequel. That‚Äôs when I need you guys. 

You probably know way more about Star Wars than I do. Watching the Star Wars movies has been an amazing experience and I want to keep it that way. What should I do now? Should I immediately start to watch all the other movies? Should I avoid some bad spin-offs? Should I take my time before I waste all the fun in a short period of time? I need your educated advice on how to preserve my new found enthusiasm of Star Wars.

67,What are your favorite and least favorite lightsaber duels in The Skywalker Saga?,1596945143,"My personal favorite duel is Obi-Wan Kenobi vs Darth Vader in Episode III: Revenge of the Sith.

It has emotion, spectacle, brilliant choreography, and the best location for a fight I‚Äôve ever seen. John Williams once again outdid himself with ‚ÄúBattle of the Heroes‚Äù, and it works so well in this context. It‚Äôs exciting all the way through and ends on the most heartbreaking moment in all of Star Wars. It‚Äôs the duel that created Darth Vader and the duel that will live on as my favorite of all time.


On the other hand, my least favorite duel is Rey vs Kylo Ren in Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker.

Now, I have a pretty unpopular opinion being that I actually enjoy this film quite a bit. It has many flaws and I recognize them, but I still have a ton of fun with it and I think it‚Äôs a pretty solid entry into the franchise. However, I don‚Äôt really like the duel on the ruins of the Death Star II between Rey and Kylo. The choreography is very slow and uninspired, the lightsabers look heavy like swords instead of like plasma beams, and the lack of music detracts from the overall feel. But I will say that I love the fights later between Ben and the Knights of Ren and Rey and Palpatine‚Äôs guards. Those are great fights that nail everything I want out of a lightsaber conflict.


I don‚Äôt think there are any bad lightsaber duels in The Skywalker Saga, that‚Äôs something Star Wars excels at. I just wanted to point out some of the high and low points for the sword fights in this franchise. What are your favorite and least favorite duels in the saga, and why?

14,A book or series that followed Luke and Rey's journey at the same time would be a great way to continue each characters stories,1596934545,"So the TROS VD gave us a very nice little timeline of what Luke was doing between sagas. He spent the first ten years traveling around, discovering jedi lore, investigating the observatories, helping lando, etc. Then 19 years before the movie he starts training Ben and the other students for about 13 years. And the final six years were of course spend on Ach-to. 

Now the post ST galaxy and the post RotJ galaxy looking so similar means their are of course going to be a lot of stories Luke and Rey can be involved in that will be vaugely similar like dealing with the FO/Imperial Remnant, dealing with the Sith cultists/Observatories and cultists, etc. But their is one major thing both of them will have in common. 

Currently right now if Rey was to start searching for Jedi Lore and rebuilding the Jedi order right after TROS we would have two stories about the Jedi Order being rebuilt within 20 years of each other in universe and at the same general time outside of the universe. 

So what would be really interesting to me is that instead of getting a series about luke hunting for jedi relics and restoring the jedi order along side a series about rey doing all of the same things, basically being sold the same story twice, is if they did it as one series. 

Imagine a three book (or longer) arc that kept switching back and forth between Luke and rey's perspectives. You could have Rey go to some of the places Luke went and read about it from the notes he left, you could have Luke run into a problem or enemy and then they show up again and Rey has to deal with them. We could see how each of them go about rebuilding the jedi at the same time and see the struggles Luke went through and see how Rey learns from them. You could even possibly have Force Ghost Luke appear from time to time when she is struggling or something like that.

I mean, a guy who ate planets to satisfy his appetite? Sounds pretty crazy and practically undermines the tremendous feats of Sith like Darth Sidious and Darth Vader. I will illustrate why this hungry and disproportionately strong character is one of the best character concepts in Star Wars. I will make this as short as possible so no one has to read an essay.

&amp;#x200B;

Darth Nihilus is intended to simulate the enslavement of one's self to the force and the dark side. He became a wound in the force after the annihilation of Malachor V, where he subsequently took the mantle of Dark Lord and sought greater power to satisfy his hunger. His need to satisfy himself stems from the fact that he is a ruin of Malachor V and that he sees no greater purpose in life after having everything taken away. To put it simply, he was a depressed man that succumbed to the lure of drugs that led to the desertion of his past and ultimately the betrayal of his spirit. The wound in the force that echoed within him desired life, and so Nihilus took life from others due to his nihilistic approach, hence why Chris Avellone named him Darth Nihilus.

&amp;#x200B;

Nihilus succumbs to his craving further, straying further from a man and into a void. The more he succumbs to his craving, the more he craves; basic addiction principle. Unlike Sith who elevate themselves to acquire power, Nihilus desires to fulfill his hunger by eating planets because he has lost himself to a point where his body even decays. Unlike characters like Vitiate who seek immortality and to wipe out all life for no reason, Nihilus cannot help it. It's an accurate portrayal of addiction and how the dark side has twisted someone. The annihilation of planets is an illustration of the extremes one can go to fulfill the satisfaction because he is a force of nature, the extremes of the dark side.

&amp;#x200B;

He is not a simple ""look at our ultra power Sith Lord""; Chris Avellone writes him as a victim to the dark side and contortion in the force. Nihilus is a cataclysmic event in which the force is nowhere to be found, a lifeless figure that exemplifies the absence of the force. He is the spirit of the dark side, a hole in the force that was once merely a man craving a simple appetite.

The characters suck, too (shocker.) Kylo is just an emo, knock-off sith, Rey is... I don't even know, Finn is actually a little decent, but all he does is yell ""REY!"", Poe is a knockoff, sucky Han Solo. Snoke is pointless, Palpatine returning is stupid, let alone being a clone being stupid. BB-8 is just a straight up (knockoff) copycat. The First order and Resistance are just knockoffs (Am I saying that word too much? Hm, not surprised) of the Empire and Rebellion. Disney made Luke be a prick, and he shouldn't. Han is fine, Leia's... okay. Lando is great (Notice how the only good characters are OT characters.) And then there are a bunch of stupid, pointless side characters. And then you've got Jaku just being a knock-off Tatooine. Force Awakens is at least enjoyable, Last Jedi should burn in hell, and TRoS is disappointing. I feel like it's just a crappy version of the Originals. JJ Abrams, Rian Johnson, and Kathleen Kennedy should NEVER touch Star Wars ever again. Disney ruined Star Wars, and, honestly, I bet they just did it for money.
I HATE the sequels and Disney and Lucasfilms should just redo the sequels with a better story that isn't a knockoff of the Originals, likable characters that aren't just knockoffs, Planets that aren't knock offs, and a better director.

5,More than a battle between good and evil (first post! :D ),1596913954,"One of the things I love most about the Star Wars prequels is that they expanded the narrative. The sequels are essentially a battle between good and evil. The prequels, in showing the Jedi to be stifling and bureaucratic and lifeless, expose the truth that both the so-called light and dark side of the Force are similarly flawed ideologies.

This was conveyed best, I think, in the video game Knights of the Old Republic 2, by the character Kreia, who strives to bring an end to the Force, who hates that it exerts its will over people and removes them of their free will.

I thought you might enjoy a video I made, that has Kreia narrate on the fall of Anakin to the dark side and on his relationship with Padme. I hold a perhaps unpopular view that Anakin and Padme's relationship was very well executed in the prequels and love it so much. So this video is as much a tribute to that as it is to a celebration of the philosophy of Kreia. I hope you enjoy it.

Hope y'all are having a great weekend thus far.

Malachor itself is one big reference, and even though it may not be the same planet that Revan destroyed, it certainly was drawn from KOTOR. 

In KOTOR, Malachor 5 was a world destroyed by a super weapon that used the planet's gravity to crush itself. We also know that there was a Sith Academy on the planet called the Trayus Academy in which Darth Traya explored and founded the Sith Triumvirate along with Darth Sion and Darth Nihilus. Could the temple in Rebels be a redesign of the Trayus Academy on Malachor 5 from KOTOR? Could the voice from the holocron be someone like Darth Traya or even Visas Marr?

My theory is that Malachor 5 'somehow' recovered from it's catastrophic events in KOTOR and eventually was the grounds for a war between Sith and Jedi. The Trayus academy was redesigned in the Canon continuity and hosted some kind of Super weapon which wiped out all the Jedi and Sith on the planet, once again devastating the planet's landscape.

79,"So I'm getting into the Legends Novels and love em, but have a couple questions",1596899858,"So I started with the Darth Bane trilogy, and finished the first book.  I really enjoy learning about how the Sith came to be and why some members turned to the dark side.  

1. There is a timeline written out inside the book, of all the legends books from Dawn of the Jedi(before the Old Republic) to the Legacy(40+ years after A New Hope).  Is this timeline still accurate? I plan to finish the trilogy, then Plagueis book then start from Dawn of the Jedi and work my way forward in time. 


2.  Are ANY of the legends books canon?  I still will read as many as I can, but was curious to see what they kept(if they kept any ideas).  

3.  I'm a pretty casual SW fan so I've only really seen the 9 movies(need to watch Mandalorian+clone wars tv shows still), but why did they decide to throw out so many books?  I can't imagine all of them being amazing, but still, could they have used some of the ideas or characters from these stories to fill the universe and make it more fleshed out?     Seems like easier way to make money + fans happy.  Take the legends books that people already love, make movie out of it, profit + happy fans? 


4.  I also found this book called ""Splinter of the Minds Eye""  from 1978.  From what I researched, it was written in case the original movie was a flop.  How could writing a book help if people didn't care for the movie?  unless I read something wrong.

Especially with the rumors that it‚Äôs in development hell, and then the obvious Covid-19, this show unfortunately will not come out soon but that‚Äôs ok as long as they take their time because I am really excited for this show. 



Anyhoo, from reading the title you read right, I want this show to be depressing as it can be but in a beautiful way. For one, this show takes place after Episode 3, to where all hell broke lose. Obi Wan lost everything, and the world just isn‚Äôt the same anymore. To top it off, he has to live on a crappy planet that‚Äôs always hot and full of sand, to where he has to be hidden all the time. In this show, I want to see Obi Wan at his lowest point in life. Such as Obi Wan constantly having nightmares and waking up from horrifically, trying to catch his breath. Or Obi Wan constantly having memories of the past and just being sad at how all that is gone now.





I guess I want a dystopian vibe of this movie per say, like imagine a beautiful shot of Tatooine at night time, with all the stars and Obi Wan just looking at them reflecting at how he use to travel the galaxy. And then of course he made a friend and is watching over the fire, reflecting the time he burned who was once a brother. God lead that‚Äôs so awesome imagining in my head. But yeah...

‚ÄúNow that they are extinct, the Jedi are romanticized, deified, but if you strip away the myth and look at their deeds, the legacy of the Jedi is failure, hypocrisy, hubris. At the height of their power, they allowed Darth Sidious to rise, create the Empire and wipe them out. It was a Jedi Master who was responsible for the training and creation of Darth Vader.""

Who exactly is romanticising the Jedi? As far as I‚Äôm aware, pretty much everyone thought the Jedi were a myth right? I really wish this was something we got to see more, rather then just being told it, that way this lesson might actually have some weight to it. The only way this even makes a little sense, at least from what we see in the ST is from a meta view. Though, it‚Äôs still wrong as the Jedi‚Äôs legacy isn‚Äôt just failure.

And the Jedi didn‚Äôt let Sidious rise, they got played by him, hard. Mace would have killed Sidious if Anakin didn‚Äôt interfere, I would hardly call that letting him win. The Jedi order definitely had its fault, but they did their best to stand for peace.

In the precules we kinda get nothing... no one every explains go us what the force is like yoda did in empire, no one tells us who the Sith are how the jedi order was formed. 

It would have made for some interesting world building to include old legends of the jedi. The most we get is talk about a prophecy about anakin but..where did this prophecy come from? Who told it? How old is it? It's literally given no explanation at any point. It also changes from bring balance to the force to destroy the sith.

71,Lucrehulks as rebel bases,1596859459,"Something that occurred to me when I was responding to a post earlier, saying that the Rebels had some CIS personnel and ships.  The more I thought about it, the more it seems to me an old *Lucrehulk* would make a great Rebel base.

They're \~3km converted (up-armed and -armored) bulk freighter.  Even with gun emplacements and whatever else, those things must have ludicrous amounts of cargo capability.

By a rough guesstimate, the inside of the cargo arms are 500m or so tall, more than enough to add some docking clamps and dock entire medium starships: CR-90s and *Consular* conversions, *Gozantis* and *Arquitens*, GR-75s, etc.

The CIS landing craft were roughly CR-90 sized, so that gives us a lot of parking inside, if needed; I'd probably reserve it for light freights and such down to starfighters, though, or larger ships that need extensive repair.

Speaking of inside, assuming the hangars/cargo bays take a full third of those arms that'd still be space for probably thousands of personnel quarters, workshops, training grounds, and so on.

Plus the core ship, which I think is 600-700 meters all on it's own.  That's a lot of volume.

Then there's those giant docking arms in the front; if the Rebellion came across a larger ship, they could probably dock anything up to Star Destroyers in those beasts.

All of that would make, I think, for a great service, supply base, and command base  And one that could *move*.

Fuel costs I think wouldn't be a huge deal, I wouldn't bother moving it all the time.  Have a set of ""cutout"" ships between the base and anything else.  The *Lucrehulk* moves on a randomized schedule to random locations, with only the cutouts knowing.  So one week its skulking around in an asteroid field, the next week its in deep space, two weeks after that its in the rings of a gas giant in some boring out of the way system.

Sure, the combat capabilities are somewhat questionable (though by the end of the Clone Wars, apparently one *Lucrehulk* was considered a proper target for a full Republic flotilla).  However, I don't think this really matters; the Rebellion prior to Endor didn't really engage all that much in fleet actions.  Even Scarif was basically supposed to be a high-powered raid.  (And because they couldn't run fast enough, they got slightly obliterated...even after the aid of a ludicrous violation of physics.

It is, I think, a missed opportunity for a series like *Rebels* to have one as a sort of Rebellion central command.",StarWars,allannon,False,/r/StarWars/comments/i5snep/lucrehulks_as_rebel_bases/

90,Wedge Antilles doesn't get enough appreciation.,1596854751,"This man. This hero, Wedge Antillies doesn't get enough appreciation in the Star Wars Fandom, and here's why:

Think about it, picture yourself in his shoes. You've just joined the Rebellion, you're a barley trained fighter pilot, when all the terrible might of the Empire comes bearing down on your home base. 
These people you are with are the only true family you've ever known, you ran away to join them, and fight in a cause you believe in, and literally days after doing this, the fucking Death Star appears in Orbit over Yavin IV. 

Do you panic? No. Do you desert? No. You calmly and collectively make your way to your Starfighter. Knowing the astronomical odds that are against you, you STILL proceed to form up upon your squad leader and shoot down those TIE bastards that are swarming the rebel  Bombers. 

Red leader gave his squadron one objective; Defend the bombers until they can make their attack run. Wedge Antillies did that. He threw himself at the enemy TIEs with zero regard for his own safety, only ensuring the Bombers could break through the Imperial line to deliver their payload to maybe, just maybe, knock out this Technological terror, and defend his comrades on the planet below. 

And when he thought all was lost, when the bombers were all but destroyed, he covered Sykwalker, a kid he had just met THAT DAY,  he still defended him to the death because he was his squad-mate.  During Skywalker's attack run, (Which was unorthodox and DEFINITELY not a usual plan of attack) Wedge prevented DARTH FUCKING VADER from getting a good shot at his squad-mate. He literally positioned himself between his squad-mate and THE DARK LORD OF THE SITH. He did not give a SHIT who Darth Vader was, all he cared about was protecting his squad-mate from enemy engagement,  he literally threw himself in-front of the guns of the 'best starfigher pilot in the galaxy'.

And thanks to his efforts, the Rebels won the day. 

Does he demand credit? No. Is he heralded as a hero? No. 

Fast forward to the Battle of Endor. 

This man knows the stakes. He knows there are a lot of rookie pilots in the Rebellion. He is STILL going in with the first wave to knock out the TIE defence around the Star Destroyers. He's engaged in the bloodiest space combat the Rebellion has ever seen, all around him his comrades are dying, and does he falter? No. Does he run? No. He covers the medical Frigate to the best of his squadrons ability, and knocks out dozens of TIEs while doing so.

And then, he receives a communication from the ground team letting him know the shields are down. What does he do? Does he wait for his squad to form up? Does he let the Falcon know the attack is commencing so to lead the fighters? NO! DOES HE FUCK! He personally leads the fighters over the surface of the second Death Star, leading them unto the breach which they have to fly down to get the core reactor. 

And when he's in there what does he do? Calmly and professionally looses his proton torpedo and scores a DIRECT HIT on the power pylon. 
Now given such an impressive feat, you'd anticipate the man who did it do boast and sound impressed with himself. What does Wedge say? ""Copy Gold Leader, I'm already on my way out."" 
This man delivered the killing blow to the second Death Star and was only concerned about letting his Squad-mates know it was time to form up to evacuate the perimeter. 

Luke Skywalker and Han Solo WISH they were half as cool as Wedge Antillies. He is the true hero of the Alliance.

5,CMV The prequels suck because Padme is a terrible character.,1596850405,"Alright, let me start off by saying I love the prequels like crazy, and the only reason we think about them so much is because we ache for the missed opportunities that are the SW prequels. I also acknowledge some ludicrous plot holes and cringey dialogue that definitely needed tweaking, but the pieces are all there, if they were haphazardly assembled. 


One of these misplaced pieces is how Padme is borderline ignored beyond being a trophy for Anakin. she's nothing more than a pretty girl that Anakin can't live without. The ""strong female character"" traits that are supposed to define her character contradict the decisions she actually makes in the movies. 


First off, let's describe Padme: She is a galactic SENATOR, formerly a Queen, Not JUST a queen, but someone whom the people *tried to amend the constitution so she could remain in office*. Therefore she is wildly competent, intelligent, and charismatic enough to run a PLANET. She possesses a very a strong sense of right and wrong, and takes her principles seriously. So seriously in fact, that she is willing to challenge the galactic status quo, and fight in insurrections, personally, to defend her people, and her principles. Such a woman would have no shortage of suitors, no? 


Ask yourself this: Why would this intelligent, powerful woman marry a dude (after what was it? A week?) who, in cold blood, murders an entire village of, innocent, though admittedly barbarian, women and children? Such an unstable young man may prove to be a danger to her at some point in the future...Right? Padme characterized as this strong, intelligent, borderline perfect character that makes this terrible decision, and there's little in the movies to back up WHY she does it. 


Anakin and Padme's relationship is supposed to be *toxic*. It's possessive, for both parties. Anakin can't let go of her, and she can't let go of him. That's where the tragedy lies. The dissonance exists because we don't see any of Padme's drives and struggles. She cares about freedom and liberty, obviously, but why? Where does her character gain the insecurity and such low self esteem where she thinks marrying a homicidal monk is a good idea? She can still be a competent and just ruler/senator, but It's simply not plausible for her to marry Anakin without ludicrous levels of fear, self loathing, and/or lack of other options, and the Padme that George Lucas gives us just doesn't have those traits.


Why couldn't we see a couple scenes of the corrupt, dangerous politics of Naboo? Always forced to rely on her parents and body guards for safety, the backstabbing politics of Naboo left her alone, and fearful. She is a pawn in her family's political agenda to be seen and not heard, protected at all times. Never knowing real friends, she would be terribly lonely. What about Coruscant where senatorial factions regularly hire bounty hunters to kill off rivals. Are her romantic relationships true love? Or are they about wealth and power? Always in danger but never really having a trusting any of her relationships. This Padme is closed of and fearful, never knowing connection, never experiencing real compassion, happiness. 


Such a character, lonely, and deprived of safety, connection would naturally see Anakin as a fantastic option. He provides freedom, security, and connection. Him being a Jedi, not interested in wealth or power, would appeal greatly to Padme since all of her other relationships were cursed by that mystery. Being so sheltered, and isolated socially as well, she would be a lot more willing to forgive some of Anakin's sins as she would have no frame of reference for how crazy he is. All this combined together would naturally lead to her clinging to him as tightly as possible as her only source of safety.


But Padme is not characterized this way. She is characterized, in fact, in quite the opposite way, which is why their relationship makes no sense. She is not a character, and is a terribly wasted opportunity. Without exploring the woman's side of the relationship, the whole of the relationship is not convincing.

8,I‚Äôve never watched Clone Wars in my life but now I‚Äôm starting to think I have too...,1596850016,"So I love the Star Wars movies but unfortunately I‚Äôve never watched the cartoon and I do have Disney+. It‚Äôs just 7 seasons are a lot to binge for me at least, and I know each episode is 20 minutes long but still. Anyhoo, I‚Äôm sure the cartoon is good but I guess simply I just never had the time to watch it, or would rather watch something else. But yeah I‚Äôm starting to think I may need to watch the show to appreciate Star Wars so much more...







Take Mando S2 for instance. Ahsoka will be in the season and who knows how big of a role she‚Äôll play. But sure, I know who she is and know that she was in Clone Wars but that‚Äôs it. I have no idea what she‚Äôs been through and all that, so going into Mando S2 I‚Äôll just be watching the episode as if it was normal. But for those who watched Clone Wars, they‚Äôll pick up any references that she says or they‚Äôll appreciate her appearance more since she‚Äôs been through so much in the show and they were with her during all that. 






And then there‚Äôs the Obi Wan show too, sure I watched the prequels but I‚Äôm sure if I watched Clone Wars then I would really know what Obi Wan had gone through. I‚Äôm sure I can go into these things with a general knowledge of Clone Wars and the characters, but seeing how I‚Äôm a Star Wars fan I feel like I wouldn‚Äôt appreciate it as much if I watched Clone Wars. I‚Äôm debating whether or not I should binge it before Mando S2, and hopefully I‚Äôll get addicted to where it‚Äôs easier to binge since I wanna watch it, but yeah.",StarWars,hushpolocaps69,False,/r/StarWars/comments/i5qg11/ive_never_watched_clone_wars_in_my_life_but_now/

10,Who else has The Phantom Menace as their favourite prequel?,1596849915,"If you'd asked me 10 years ago, I would have told you that Revenge of the Sith was my favourite, but I think that a big part of that is that that's kinda what I *wanted* to think. After being a little disappointed in the first two Prequels, I was PUMPED for ROTS because we finally got to see everything that the Prequels had promised. Finally we would get the 'Blue on Blue' duel, the fall of the Republic and the rise of the Empire. And those things definitely did happen and we're a great spectacle, if nothing else...

But as time has worn on I find myself gravitating more and more towards The Phantom Menace. And why? Well, I think that nostalgia definitely plays a part. The only thing in my life that has superseded the level of excited anticipation that I felt waiting for that film to come out was waiting for the birth of my son. It was a special time to be a Star Wars fan and I'm not sure we've been lucky enough to experience anything like it since. 

So there is that.¬† But I think there's also more to it. There's something about those two Hayden Christensen/Australia films that's just a bit 'soapy' for me. They feel a tad melodramatic: more Days of Our Lives than Return of the Jedi. The Phantom Menace is more of a fun film than the other Prequels and I feel that it also stands better on its own. Sure, it could probably be cut from the trilogy without really having much impact on the story, but I think that's a strength as much as anything. It's the film which has to spend the least amount of time and effort tying into everything else. It brought us Naboo and it gave us an amazing look at life on Tatooine in a way which I think did add to the original film. 

The podracing is thrilling and the final lightsaber fight is the best in the Prequels. And let's not forget John Williams' score. It's the best of the PT by a mile for me. Anakin's theme is gorgeous, Jar Jar's theme is brilliantly naive and also quite grand, the Trade Federation Invasion music is something I'll never tire of and what more can you say about Duel of the Fates? I never thought I'd be watching a Star Wars music video on MTV2.

Strangely enough, I also find that the effects in TPM hold up better, too. I'm not sure whether this is because that film had the English effects crews working on it, but I do see a difference. I think TPM feels like it has more practical sets than the other two. Don't get me wrong, the sets in AOTC and ROTS are still great, but a few of them look like comped-in miniatures more than sets that actors are engaging with. The partial set for Theed makes a big difference to me and I don't think the totally CGI/miniature exterior sets work as well on the follow up Prequels.

Then we also have Qui Gon Jinn, who I loved as an old school Jedi.

There's plenty to criticise the film for, but it's been done to death (including by me) and this isn't the thread for it, really (unless your comparing with the other Prequels).

42,Fan theory,1596843475,"What if the Jedi Council's betrayal of Ahsoka turned into something even more than it was in the Clone Wars? Although this could never have been canon, due to release dates and such, I think this is a nice idea to explore. Sorry if this is a little long. And I am aware that most of this would never possibly happen for many reasons, I am just saying if it somehow did, it would be entertaining if executed properly.

In The Clone Wars Season 5, we got the Framed Ahsoka arc (I'm not fully sure about any more proper names for the arc, but if you've watched it, you know what I am talking about. Spoilers for anyone who hasn't watched the story arc.) Ahsoka is framed for murdering an imprisoned bomber. Both the Republic and the Jedi Council practically abandoned her, even after all she had done and sacrificed for them in the previous seasons. 

I was thinking- betrayal has often led many Jedi to the dark side. What if this happened with Ahsoka?

First- Ahsoka would get a major power boost. While no, the dark side isn't actually more powerful than the light side, the dark side does allow a force user to access much more... Crude and cruel abilities. Ahsoka is no fool, and she is not someone you want to mess with. Her skill and power likely makes her one of, if not the most powerful padawan in the Jedi Order at the time, although I don't really know much about the other padawans, Ahsoka is one of the few Jedi overall to have had multiple confrontations with Dooku and Grievous, who have both killed numerous Jedi. She even fought and very nearly defeated Asajj Ventress in this very same story arc. Asajj has gone toe-to-toe with Kenobi and Skywalker before. 

Second- Yoda, Anakin, Kenobi, and possibly Plo Koon would all sense this turn to the dark side, as well as Chancellor Palpatine. The Jedi Order would want to save her from the dark side, because of these reasons- 

1. She is usually kind and light-hearted, and they would know that this turn to the dark side would have to have been inflicted by an exterior source.

2. As long as they could get to her before she had been with the dark side for too long, she was still saveable. 

While the Chancellor would first let the Jedi Order try to handle this due to his plans being near, and her being with the Order would, as far as he knows, end in her death anyway. If the Order takes too long, however, he will want to end her before she starts to become more of a rival and a threat to his power. Although we can assume his power far outweighs her own, the same could be said about Darth Maul. Even still, Sidious went to deal with him. And Ahsoka, in Season 7, defeated Maul, making her a bigger threat to Sidious than Maul was. 

Now, onto the canon changes. Order 66 would have to be postponed, granting the Jedi more time to possibly discover the Chancellor's plans and stop them. This is due to Anakin being completely involved in finding and saving his former padawan. If he were to find out at that point that Sidious was a Sith Lord, well, he's never been the wisest of all the characters, and he might wonder if Ahsoka's turn was somehow connected to Sidious. This would make him choose- his padawan in distress or someone who he considered and best friend and mentor. The choice alone could tear him apart. He would likely tell the Order, and the duel between Mace and Palpatine would go the same way it did, except Anakin would be preoccupied with finding Ahsoka, and Mace would have won, exposing the chancellor's lies to the senate. 

Now, the Separatists would be headless. All of its major military leaders would have been dead except for the Trade Federation, who have never really been the brightest. This is where dark Ahsoka comes in. (any ideas for her Sith name?) She would figure out where the remaining Separatist leaders are (Mustafar) and go there. At first, she will have to dismantle a few droids to get to them. But, she would ""convince"" them to give her command of the droid army. The Republic, thinking the Clone Wars is over with the fall of it's perpetrator, Sidious, would be unprepared for Ahsoka to make her return with the Seppies. She would be after revenge- revenge against the Order for what she felt was a betrayal. (And it was a betrayal, to make it clear.) 

And now, the Clone Wars would be on again. The Republic will be in a vulnerable state, trying to pick the best leader to defeat Ahsoka and the Separatists. The Jedi Order would take temporary full command of the Clone Army, which would increase tensions between the Jedi and the public, who, toward the end of the Clone Wars, start to more and more dislike the Jedi for acting like peacekeepers while fighting a war. Ahsoka would try to use this tension to her advantage, and many systems would join the Separatists in defiance against the Republic. Meanwhile, Darth Maul managed to completely take over Mandalore and is now the leader of a completely different faction- The Shadow Collective. Ahsoka and he would become uneasy allies, both knowing that the other is making a betrayal plan, and both of them making said plans. 

Now, the Shadow Collective and the Separatist Alliance are one. This further increases the tension in the galaxy. More systems join Ahsoka. Darth Maul starts to teach Ahsoka the ways of the force in a feeble attempt to gain her trust. She accepts, but she doesn't give him any trust. Ahsoka's power and abilities grow, and she becomes harder for the Jedi to save from herself. 

The Republic found its leader! A new chancellor takes the chair and starts trying to ease tensions between the Jedi and the public, but both are still keeping an eye on the chancellor due to the broken trust made by Sidious. But by now, the Separatists have more systems than the Republic, and the galaxy is in a state of all-out war. The Order is constantly trying to contact Ahsoka directly to try to save her, but she refuses to speak with them. She recruits more generals and assassins to take the place of Grievous. But none of them seem to compare. She starts hiring bounty hunters and mercenaries like Cad Bane, Hondo, and Bossk. She permanently hired Hondo and his pirates as a part of the Separatists. 

Meanwhile, the Republic is scrambling to gather every resource it can get while trying to calm the public and keep the Separatists at bay. 

Finally, Anakin and Obi-Wan get face to face with Ahsoka. Her lightsabers are now red, and her padawan braid is gone. She wears the same clothes she wore in Season 7. She has the signature yellow eyes. Maul is by her side, but Anakin and Kenobi didn't expect him. They fight. Maul is defeated by Kenobi, while Ahsoka and Anakin duel hard. Anakin is winning at first, but Ahsoka manages to cut his robotic arm off again. He picks up his saber with his other arm, but Ahsoka starts to flee before Kenobi could interfere. Even though she knows Maul will someday betray her, she saves him, showing that she isn't completely lost yet. The two Jedi notice this. During the duel, however, she told Anakin she hates the Order and tells him her end goals. The Council is told of both events. The Order decides that she is acting and speaking out of pain and anger, and she can still be saved. 

They meet over and over again over the years. The Republic is practically bankrupt and the public hates the Jedi. If the war doesn't end soon, the Separatists will win anyway and Ahsoka will have her revenge. Maul makes his move, and he and Ahsoka duel. He loses. Still not completely lost, she instead banishes him to the same trash planet that Savage Oppress found him on. The Jedi, now including Yoda and Plo Koon with Kenobi and Skywalker, meet her for the final time. Although still able to be saved, she is now a fully-realized Sith. But, she still has not killed, and under her rule, the Separatists have not been cruel towards citizens, and they now keep prisoners in safe, sanitary, and even comfortable conditions, all things recognized by the Republic. Ahsoka fights the four Jedi. First, they attempt to take her one at a time. But, after that fails, they attack at one time. Ahsoka is defending well, but Yoda manages to destroy her smaller saber. Her other saber is knocked away by a strong swing by Anakin. Instead of holding their blades to her, Obi-Wan reminds them to lower their blades. Ahsoka notices this. They start convincing her to dismantle to Separatist Alliance and all of its allies and return as a friend who was saved, alive. The only other option, Ahsoka knew, was to return as a war criminal, either in chains or dead. She first wants to choose the second option, but after realizing how sincere the Order's apology was and realizing they weren't perfect, and they knew that she picks up her lightsaber and ignites it. At first, they start to prepare to battle. But instead, she closes her eyes and the saber turns white. The Jedi realize she healed the bleeding kyber crystal. 

She leaves with them to Mustafar, where she shuts down the majority of the droid army. The remaining droids are destroyed. The Republic, being bankrupt and desperate, reprogram all salvageable droids and take all salvageable Separatist weapons, vehicles, starfighters, and ships and uses them with the remaining clones and Jedi. After looking through all of Palpatine's possessions, the Jedi come across his Wayfinder to Exegol. Anakin, Obi-Wan, Yoda, Plo Koon, Mace Windu, and Ahsoka Tano leave to Exegol with a large fleet. They then go inside the tunnels and insides of the planet. After figuring out what it is, they lay bombs and charges inside and blow the Sith world apart just before jumping to Hyperspace. They find and destroy all remnants of the Sith. Ahsoka is forgiven and pardoned for her crimes against the Republic. The Jedi Order took responsibility instead. The Jedi Order left the Grand Army of The Republic, which was now both clones and clankers. Hondo and the Shadow Collective fled to the shadows, the Shadow Collective even disbanding once and for all.

15,Personal Preferred Viewing Order,1596828178,"Okay, so it's that time of year again and I'm doing my annual re-watch of the Star Wars movies. I've been trying to find the optimal order, considering the Disney movies, and I think I may have found the order that I like the best. Without further ado, here it is:

1.Solo

2.Rogue One

3.A New Hope (Despecialized)

4. Empire Strikes Back (Despecialized)

5. Attack of the Clones

6. Revenge of the Sith

7. Vader Immortal (all episodes in order)

\-Optional: Any of the Disney canon Vader Comics (I was surprised at how good these are)

8. Return of the Jedi (Despecialized)

9. The Force Awakens

10. The Last Jedi

11. The Rise of Skywalker

&amp;#x200B;

I chose this order, as I feel it best represents the intent of the series. It is a modified machete order to include the Disney canon. There are fan edits that make ""A Phantom Menace"" watchable, but overall I feel that the movie adds nothing to the overall series except for the introduction of Palpatine's origins, but even then, the cartoonish nature of this movie cuts against the grain of the rest of the series.

I have included the Vader Immortal trilogy since I feel that it really fleshes out the character of Darth Vader, humanizing him in a way that even the prequels fail to.

The new Vader comics are good, and deserve a spot in the viewing order if you want to see more about the rise of the Empire.

I have included the side story movies as they flesh out various characters from ""A New Hope,"" and give a decent amount of background information about where the series starts.

Of course, this is all my opinion, but if you have the time to watch through the series in this order, maybe give it a try.",StarWars,softcornpore,False,/r/StarWars/comments/i5k86m/personal_preferred_viewing_order/

The closest he gets with Luke is sensing his Force abilities during the Battle:

+ *VADER: The Force is strong with this one!*

But by the beginning of The Empire Strikes Back, he is aware of Luke Skywalker and knows that he's a member of the Rebellion. When his probe discovers the Rebels on Hoth:

+ *OZZEL: My Lord, there are so many uncharted settlements. It could be smugglers, it could be ---*

+ *VADER: That is the system. And I'm sure Skywalker is with them. Set your course for the Hoth System. General Veers, prepare your men.*



And he isn't surprised when the Emperor later indicates that Luke is the son of Anakin:

+ *PALPATINE: The Force is strong with him. The son of Skywalker must not become a Jedi.*

65,Darth Vader is nothing but a failure,1596819689,"Not serious ofcourse, Vader is one of my alltime favorites.

But he fails at everything.

Atleast, if you look at the movies only.

Episode 3, when he becomes the Darth Vader we know, Padme dies. Failing all that he set out to do.

Rogue One, one of the coolest scenes of Darth Vader, but what does he accomplish? He just kills a bunch of nameless rebels and doesn't achieve his objective, to get the data. So he fails. The scene looks very awesome, but that is all. A couple of stormtroopers would have the same result.

&amp;#x200B;

Episode 4, Androids escape in the pod. Leia isn't scared and doesn't reveil the location of the rebel base. Sure the planet gets destroyed,but he couldn't make Leia talk. He kills Ben Kenobi, but this only makes Ben more influential in Luke's case and Han and Luke are able to rescue Leia. So he doesn't see the bigger picture.

In the finale the Death Star is destroyed, the failed again.

&amp;#x200B;

Episode 5, invasion of Hoth is a small succes, the most important members of the resistence escape. Even without Vader the Empire would have won that battle, seeing how overpowered they are against the rebels in that fight. I don't see this as a succes for Vader.

He even gives Han Solo away when he is finally captured, something that could play a very important role, if Luke doens't fall for this trap.

Luke doens't fall in his trap completely.

His fight against Luke only gives Luke more information he needs to win over Vader. Luke escapes.

Han is not a prisoner of the empire anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

Episode 6, Luke comes to him willingly. Vader had far too little to do in the movie. Han, who he gave away to Boba Fett, is freed. He leads the rebel assault and detroys the shield. 

&amp;#x200B;

Yet he still scares me and I love me some Vader.",StarWars,Joppe87,False,/r/StarWars/comments/i5hjic/darth_vader_is_nothing_but_a_failure/

91,Padm√© Amidala in Episode III: Emotional and vulnerable character or weak and whiny plot device?,1596814508," It widely agreed upon that out of the three films of the Prequel Trilogy, Episode III ‚Äì Revenge of the Sith is the greatest one. Although it still has its fair share of criticism (Anakin's turn, CGI, Dialogue, etc), one of the most oddly popular ones I've seen floating on the internet is the role Padm√© Amidala takes within this film.  


If you don't know what I'm talking about, basically a large margin of audience viewers were disappointed that Padm√©, who was shown in TPM and AOTC as a very intelligent, idealistic, perfectly dedicated and heroic woman, became a passive and submissive pregnant wife. Some really angered by this go as far to say she has become completely unlikeable in the film, saying she became a worthless, pathetic, hopeless, helpless, weepy, timid, simpering, wimpy and whiny plot device who's only relevant action in the film is giving birth and dying.  


Now, am I saying one of those people? Of course not! I'm on the side of her becoming more emotional and vulnerable with human reactions to her situations within the movie. There's also the point that her pregnancy would dismiss her role in the plot since Star Wars is an action-adventure film and I don't know many women who would go into open battle while 9 months in with twins. Because of that, I fully accept the direction of her character other than maybe her death scene.  


Now there's also story ideas and concepts of what Padm√© could have done in the movie before they were cut to save time for Anakin's plot. Those you can find here:  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3\_eqf6WRQ4o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_eqf6WRQ4o)   
[https://www.gamesradar.com/the-orig...\_source=twitter.com&amp;utm\_campaign=buffer\_sfxtw](https://www.gamesradar.com/the-original-star-wars-revenge-of-the-sith-ending-had-padme-found-the-rebel-alliance-and-almost-kill-anakin/?utm_content=buffere8dbe&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer_sfxtw)  


If you're too lazy to watch/read, the short version was Padm√© was going to plant the seeds of the Rebel Alliance and attempt to kill Anakin on Mustafar just before she knew she couldn't and Anakin would choke her and the movie stays the same from there.  


Now this would have been great but I believe there were two reasons they were cut:  
1) The official reason was that George Lucas wanted to focus more on Anakin since this is his most important film. The original cut of Revenge was revealed to be four hours long and that was trimmed so that Anakin's turn would be the main plot with everything else sadly being discarded.  
2) This is one is more of a theory but as we know, Jar Jar Binks was...let's just say not very popular and because of that, he went from being one of the central characters for Phantom Menace to background character with some plot relevance in Attack of the Clones to cameo with only one word to say in Revenge of the Sith, meaning Lucas listens to the criticism of the fans and rewrote his plot to please them. As we also know, another famous Prequel criticism is politics and the amount of ""walking and talking"" or ""sitting and talking"" in them. This makes me believe that when Lucas was cutting Revenge, he thought the fans would have found the Padm√© scenes dull and boring and decided to remove them in favour of the Utapau subplot which is very action-pack but in all truth, not important to film other than getting Obi-Wan away from Anakin and giving a reason why the Separatist council is on Mustafar, leading to the passive role Padm√© takes.  


So what do you guys think? Did you find Padm√© likeable in III or saw it as an absolute betrayal of her character? Would you have wanted her rebellion subplot or did you think it was unnecessary?",StarWars,EmperorReddit,False,/r/StarWars/comments/i5fz9w/padm√©_amidala_in_episode_iii_emotional_and/

97,"The prequels are viewed through the lenses of childhood nostalgia, and not given nearly the same level of criticism/analysis as the sequels.",1596812242,"The new trend in the star wars community is to go from acknowledging the prequels as incredibly flawed movies but enjoyable still, to acting as if they're overwhelmingly good with just a few minor errors. Subreddits like r/prequelmemes don't really realise that so much of the prequels is memeable because the dialogue is just so awful. The prequels are becoming these beloved amazing films despite the monumental amount of questionable decisions made from George Lucas, meanwhile we had 9 hour analysis videos for a single sequel movie. 


Now that the people who grew up with the prequels are grown up, they're able to view films with a more objective lense and we see that through the constant complaint of the sequels, although many of the arguments are not very good. If the prequels came out today, I genuinely think they would be the laughing stock of not just star wars but most of cinema for a very long time.

You can say nearly the exact same thing about the original trilogy. Vader is Lukes dad? Leia is his sister? (They kissed!) It's like there was no overall story from the get go and the directors all had different visions in each movie. Neither of these were hinted at at all in A New Hope. 

Obi-Wan (the beloved prequel trilogy character) just let himself die so easily and only returns as a wise ghost? Lukes floats to safety(don‚Äôt tell me he happened to fall into a tiny hole and safety slide to a stop)? Boba Fett is defeated with a minimal amount of effort? With all the build up towards Jabba, he's killed off so easily? And the best one...Luke becomes such a powerful force user in a short amount of time to take on both Vader and Palpatine? 

Wait, let's try that again...

Han ( the beloved original trilogy character) just let himself die so easily and only returns as a wise vision? Leia floats to safety (if inexperienced Luke can fall THAT far, is this really that big of a stretch)? Knights of Ren are defeated with a minimal amount of effort? With all the build up towards Snoke, he's killed off so easily? And the best one...Rey becomes such a powerful force user in a short amount of time to take on both Kylo and Palpatine? 

Oh and don't forget...Luke‚Äôs drinks milk from a bantha...but that is ok because we don‚Äôt see him milk it. 

Yes I know, this further proves the sequels mirror the originals BUT if you really think about it, had the original trilogy come out today in the age of social media, I think they would‚Äôve been ripped to shreds.

The more that Mandalorian history was explored, especially all of the honor and tradition, the less respect I've had for him. I mean, he's not even Mandalorian.

The Phantom menace: he liked,and didn't mind Jar Jar Binks from what I remember

Attack of the clones: he hated this one,he said there was way too much talking and found it boring,he didn't even make it to the end,but he watched up until to the point where Kenobi is going to see the clone army

Revenge of the sith: he thought it was decent,all tho he thought they made Vader a bit too evil by having him kill kids

A new hope: He, suprisingly, really, really,liked it,I didn't expect him to like it that much,but he did. He also liked the fight between obi-wan and Vader. He said the prequels were crap compared to this. Also, during the Vader vs obi-wan battle he was like "" obi-wan's gonna die isn't he?"",and,as we all know,he was right.

The Empire strikes back: he liked it just as much as a new Hope

Return of the Jedi: he liked it just as much as A New Hope and the empire strikes back,also, during the final battle,I swear I have no idea how,he said ""Vader is gonna save Luke isn't he?"",which is super weird,he hadn't watched those movies before.

The force awakens: he actually liked it just as much as the OT. He loved when Han and Chewie enter the millennium falcon for the first time since it is the first time we see them in TFA and from what I understand,those two are his favorite characters from SW. Also,he made another crazy prediction,he said ""this is gonna be Han and Chewie's final movie probably (implying they were gonna die)"",he was, partly right as we all know. Seriously,even when we watch other stuff even then he makes some crazy predictions which offer turn out correct. When I told him this and the other sequels are hated,he couldn't understand why because he thought TFA was awesome and he can't wait to watch 8 and 9.

On the bridge of the Invisible Hand, when Obi-Wan and Anakin escape Grievous‚Äô capture, remember how Grievous jumps out of the window into the unforgiving vacuum of space? Well he would have died. Here‚Äôs why:

He is not a droid. He is a cyborg. The difference is that droids can operate w/ out the need to breathe. General G. has a pair of lungs and therefore, he needs to breathe. Also no, you could not argue that he could have held his breath or whatever for that long. This is for 3 reasons. 
.1) he had to travel too far down the ship to reach the pods.
.2) Even if (1) was true, General G clearly has bad lungs, which is made clear by the constant coughing.
.3) if I remember rightly, General G coughed just as he left the bridge, which means most of the air he was holding in his lungs is gone.

13,About the clones...,1596778317,"Ok. I'll admit I get kind of annoyed whenever I see posts about the clones these days. So I thought I'd present my thoughts on them in regards to the relatively recent depictions of them within the overarching narrative of Star Wars.

First of all, I've never understood why people would even assume that clones aren't just as sentient as other people. Like they're clones... in other words, they're like Jango's twins (in this case genetically modified twins). Like is anyone surprised to find out that two twins don't act as the same person in real life? That they are both just as sentient as anyone else and are the same as anyone else apart from their similar appearance and genetic strengths/weaknesses? If anything, what should make the clones seem less than human would be their lack of exposure to anything other than a highly closeted military upbringing, which would lead to highly conformist behaviour for the most part. Or the fact that they were commissioned for nothing but war and could therefore be construed as disposable by the state which owns them.

&amp;#x200B;

This brings me to my other issue with the current depiction of the clones. The chips in their heads are completely unnecessary for Order 66. In fact, they kind of undermine the whole idea of making a clone army in the first place. The whole reason you'd make a clone army rather than a droid army in this context is that an army of living beings would leave no evidence of some sort of ""conspiracy"" against the Jedi and they cannot be reprogrammed; therefore they will follow the protocols you raised them under without question, at least by and large. Which, for Order 66, is all that is necessary (elaborated down below). This is even more so the case once you realize that the clones would not have much of a concept of what ""normal life"" might look like because they would basically live completely isolated from normal society. 

The reason why Palpatine wasn't after the elimination of every single Jedi is that he was after the Jedi Order as a powerful institution which would oppose him, which he successfully eradicated. He doesn't care about some half-trained padawans in the outer-rim who have no power to influence anything. Therefore he doesn't need every clone to follow the order, just the vast majority. Given the arguments I gave above, I see no reason why the clones would need the chips.

Also, considering the fact that the Jedi were trained primarily as peace-keepers/diplomats, having them at the helm of clone units would for the most part only incur the disgust of the clones under their command; who would have to suffer the consequences of their inevitably and almost universal tactical and strategic incompetence. So Jedi like Anakin who were both brilliant militarily and encouraged non-conformist thinking in his soldiers would be by far in the minority. This means that most would have no qualms with following through with Order 66 anyways. 

Just to drive this point home, imagine knowing no other life than that of being raised with your brothers in brutal military training with no concept of any other kind of life for your entire existence until deployment. Then, for the next few years, you are at war without a break (because you are not a citizen of the Republic, so you have no rights; plus GAR forces are already stretched very thin so the Republic can't afford to give you time off anyways) under the command of some peace-loving diplomats/zealots who have no military training/mindset whatsoever. Having been trained your whole life to be the perfect soldier in a completely sterilized and socially isolated environment where you would never encounter different views of the world except perhaps some caricatures from the Holonet once the war has started and you have some downtime during troop shuffles/resupplies, you are then given the order from the highest authority to take out your Jedi officer who is at the very least responsible for many of your brothers' deaths through their inexperience in command if not complete incompetence (while you have a decade's worth of training). And just to add a cherry on top, military forces throughout history all the way up until present day have committed far, far worse atrocities despite having been raised in loving homes and as full members of society.

* No villain
** Hux is moved from credible threat to buffoonish enemy
** Kylo killing Snokes one dead villian and another who shows signs of redemption
* Rey having no lineage.
* Rebellion and First Order being reduced to a handful of ships each
* Killing off Luke but having Carrie Fisher die

I've tried numerous times to imagine a way to take the baton from TLJ and come up with a compelling movie. I can't do it, as such I feel like I have to temper some of my disdain.

56,Star Wars Completionist Marathon Chronicles: Episode 2- Attack of the Clones,1596769948,"So someone pointed out that I didn't explain what the ""Completionist Marathon"" is. Basically I'm watching all the available canon Star Wars content available to date. You can find the list I'm following [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/i26o9c/star_wars_completionist_marathon_chronicles/g03j3cq?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share). 

For me, AOTC was always the ""flashy-est"" (for lack of a better term) movie. I remember seeing all those Jedi and all those lightsabers in one place during the battle of Genosis was the most epic thing ever. Jedi are one of my favorite aspects of Star Wars and seeing so many in one place was amazing and impressive. Whenever I think about AOTC the first thing that comes to mind is the droids v Jedi fight in the arena because of how grand it has always seemed to me.

As I continue to write these chronicles, I want y'all to know that my points won't necessarily be in order of their occurrence in the movie/series. I'm just writing things down as they come to me. Here's my thoughts on the movie:

-Seeing Anakin hit on Padme in this movie is perhaps one of the most cringy and uncomfortable things to sit through. AOTC is one of the movies that I hadn't seen for a long time until I started this marathon. I guess when I was younger the romantic scenes between Padme and Anakin kinda just flew over my head, but now it was straight up weird. At the same time, Anakin being a guy who held on to a borderline obsessive crush on Padme while growing up in an environment that essentially encourages the suppression of emotions kind of validates his cringy attempts at being romantic. Teenagers typically don't fully know how to express their feelings in a healthy way in the first place, and combine that with the Jedi's philosophy at the time and his obsession with Padme, it's kind of expected for him to act that way around her.

-The Kaminoans are straight up creepy to me, and I don't think that'll ever change.

-It was really interesting how the Separatists had plans for the Death Star so early on. I can't believe I never noticed them before. 

-That scene on Tattooine where Anakin is riding the speeder to the Tusken Raider village is so simple, but incredibly powerful. You can see how angry Anakin was without anything being said. 

-If Obi Wan would've listened to Dooku, or baited him into talking more about the Sith things could've turned out way differently. Crazy how there are so many moments throughout the prequels where if the Jedi would've paid just a little more attention they could've ended things a lot earlier. It's crazy how much Palps relied on the Jedi's judgement being so clouded by corruption and arrogance to pull off his plan, and yet it paid off.

-I don't know why, but I feel like Yoda was holding back a little bit during the fight with Dooku. I personally think it should not have been that difficult for Yoda to keep that heavy thing from falling on Anakin and Obi Wan. If he was going at it 100% and really trying to catch Dooku, I think he could've put the object out of harm's way in time to keep Dooku from escaping. Maybe I'm just overestimating Yoda, but that's what it looks like to me.

-As much as I cringed at the Padme-Anakin scenes throughout the movie, I loved the wedding scene at the end. In that moment I was rooting for their relationship even though their we're obviously red flags that should've been addressed before getting married or even considering a serious romantic relationship in the first place.

Simply put and from a thematic point of view, it should've been a combined effort from both Ben and Rey to defeat Palpatine. Having a Skywalker and a Palpatine defeat The Emperor makes poetic and thematic sense for this Saga, and gives a proper payoff to the whole Force Dyad thing. I would not be surprised at all if at some point this was the original intention, but got changed for whatever reason. Because otherwise if the whole point and payoff of the Force Dyad was to have a moment where Palpatine shoots Level 100 Sith Lightning into the sky, then I'm at a loss of words.

89,My biggest issue with TROS is that I walked out of it thinking that Lucasfilm had no plan,1596744580,"Look. It does not matter that they didn‚Äôt originally have an end plan in mind. There is room for change and creativity and exploration in filmmaking. Star Wars is a fun franchise with a deep bench of lore and fans and potential. 

TFA a very fun, if not safe, film. It reminded a lot of people what they like about Star Wars. It was light and had characters with quotable lines and moments. 

TLJ, while divisive on plot elements, did so much to push the characters themselves to their own unique places and really called into question the hard answers of who they became. While the characters physically didn‚Äôt go very far, all of them ended TLJ in very different emotional and spiritual states than before. 

Leading up to TROS, I kept saying that it did not matter if you liked 7/8, loved 7 hated 8, hated 7 loved 8, the key was that 9 had to wrap it together and people should have been able walk away from that film feeling like that was a cohesive experience. 

TROS was a mess of a movie with a series of non sensical plot elements and reduced Rey to being the granddaughter(or clone daughter whatever) of Palpatine with shit explanation for how he came back. 

All that aside, when the credits rolled, I thought, they didn‚Äôt have a clue what they were doing. By 9 being so bad, the entire trilogy is weakened. Revenge of the Sith seriously boosted the PT and Return of the Jedi was an amazing ending for the OT. 

TROS butchers the ending and leaves the viewer with whiplash. The fun of the movie is robbed by the lack of true emotional weight or follow through. 

Even if it wasn‚Äôt Endgame level (which come on, Star Wars should have been able to stick the landing) I at least wanted a trilogy that was solid but now they‚Äôve GOT‚Äôd it and I‚Äôve lost desire to watch the end of the ST again.",StarWars,InfinityOnGauntlet,False,/r/StarWars/comments/i4z6hp/my_biggest_issue_with_tros_is_that_i_walked_out/
